they are just they have such a better more mature outlook on life and i think they're better people because of it they're much more responsible i know um	2353	B
the church that i go to um the young men give two years of their life when they turn nineteen you know they're encouraged to do that missionary work and i believe- i really believe that the people that do that	2353	B
are better people and uh make our society better	2353	B
uh-huh	2353	B
um-hum	2353	B
um-hum	2353	B
uh-huh	2353	B
hm	2353	B
yeah	2353	B
hm	2353	B
yes yes but if	2353	B
uh-huh	2353	B
uh-huh	2353	B
well i think so it puts you out on your own and and in a time after high school um	2353	B
there's kind of a selfishness i mean teenagers in our country are kind of	2353	B
kind of a year that parents don't look forward to and and things like that and i think that it would help people to become less self-centered and to be more responsible when you're out on your own trying to um	2353	B
thinking less of your own needs but of other people	2353	B
um-hum	2353	B
uh-huh	2353	B
oh no	2353	B
um-hum	2353	B
right	2353	B
um-hum	2353	B
yes	2353	B
it would really um and i don't the people that i've known like from Germany and Finland that have done that are they do military service which you know i don't exactly recommend but still	2353	B
they have benefited from it and um you know although i wouldn't want	2353	B
military- military- to make people to go off to the military voluntarily but it's it has helped them and they are just a lot more mature than the average student and	2353	B
um-hum	2353	B
well that's right a lot of people they flunk out or they get they just	2353	B
are so excited to be away from home that they just spend all their time partying and they do a lot of things to themselves and that we don't really want our young people to be doing and	2353	B
um	2353	B
yeah	2353	B
um-hum	2353	B
because- because we're so	2353	B
we love our freedom and our freedom of choice	2353	B
and um having people but you know our like in our church it it is you're free to do that or not you're encouraged to do it because um you know it it helps you and	2353	B
of course we think it's helping other people and so	2353	B
uh-huh	2353	B
um-hum	2353	B
um-hum	2353	B
and they're preoccupied with drinking	2353	B
uh-huh and	2353	B
um-hum	2353	B
that's true	2353	B
that's really true	2353	B
yes well i- i don't know how that would ever happen here but at least um	2353	B
oh really	2353	B
um-hum	2353	B
hm	2353	B
well i have seen a big change i think in high school kids that my relatives and friends that um i know when i was in high school i had an idea of what i really wanted to do with	2353	B
what my what i was going to study and at least i had some interest in a lot of the youth that i come in contact with are they say oh i want to be a doctor i want to be a lawyer why because they make a lot of money	2353	B
and they don't have a goal they don't have a goal they don't have an interest in their own field of study they're just looking what's going to pay the biggest cash	2353	B
um-hum	2353	B
area yes	2353	B
yes there's too many people	2353	B
um-hum	2353	B
that's right and not enough people want to do that to for	2353	B
uh because of a service that they could provide you know if you want to be a lawyer because you know that you can provide a service that people need because you have to have lawyers in this country um but if you're just doing it because_1 you think that's the best way to be rich	2353	B
um-hum	2353	B
that's kind of sad well anyway well i guess i better go	2353	B
well good luck to you i enjoyed it	2353	B
thanks bye-bye	2353	B
well what kind of pets do you have	2396	A
are you- you're married	2396	A
and newly married	2396	A
oh	2396	A
sounds like us	2396	A
only we started off ours with we had we had pets before we had kids that's why i thought when you were saying you know we're going to have one in two months or something	2396	A
perhaps that you were newly married	2396	A
hm	2396	A
yeah	2396	A
yes	2396	A
that's easier	2396	A
are you going to get a dog	2396	A
that's what that's what we have is two dogs	2396	A
big dogs	2396	A
well our first both they were our child substitutes before we had our children	2396	A
and we got one right after we got married we both decided we needed a dog we went to the pound and we got this mutt	2396	A
and he's been it was alright before we had our kids it was he's just he's a real hyper dog he barks and and jumps a lot	2396	A
so we had him for a year and then my husband decided after we had him a year that he'd wanted for his entire life to have a Siberian husky	2396	A
and i think why didn't you tell me a year ago when we got the other dog	2396	A
you know this was your dream of your life to have a Siberian husky	2396	A
so we got the other one	2396	A
for him and to keep the first one company when we were at work all day	2396	A
so we have the the old the older dog's a male and he's	2396	A
he weighs about forty pounds and then Pepper is a year younger and she weighs	2396	A
about seventy pounds	2396	A
so we have two massive dogs	2396	A
go through lots of dog food	2396	A
absolutely	2396	A
i never wanted my husband wanted indoor dogs because he'd grown up with them but i can't stand it indoors	2396	A
i don't they shed and you know the mud and	2396	A
oh yeah	2396	A
there for me dogs are meant to be outside	2396	A
goodness	2396	A
oh my goodness	2396	A
sure	2396	A
they're going to run you down	2396	A
goodness and all of them were in the house	2396	A
hm	2396	A
i see	2396	A
yeah	2396	A
hm	2396	A
okay	2396	A
oh when i was growing up my folks we had fox terriers which are little bitty	2396	A
they weigh about ten pounds	2396	A
and so we had we had one for a long time	2396	A
and then oh gosh when i was about ten or eleven i guess my parents decided that dogs would be a good way to teach reproduction so then they went out and got a female	2396	A
and then we started having puppies and she had	2396	A
she had four or five litters she always had to look we always kept them in the house when they had the when she when the babies were little	2396	A
and the rest of the time they were outside they had a big we had a big uh kind of a play house and part of that was their dog house it was kind of cordoned off	2396	A
so they had a place to stay out there and then they had the yard and they had a little run that uh they kept them in when we were trying to do stuff in the back yard and didn't want them out	2396	A
but we had the same kind of situation at one point in time we had the mother the one of her last	2396	A
her next to last litter we kept we had one the one we never could get rid of	2396	A
and we have him	2396	A
and then our female she had another litter we didn't think she was we thought she was too old to get pregnant again	2396	A
turned out she wasn't	2396	A
and uh she had her litter i guess her last litter had like	2396	A
four and two of them survived and then she didn't make it	2396	A
two days after the they were born she had a she died	2396	A
she had some kind of an infection from it all she was just too old	2396	A
we had to feed the puppies we had to get up night and day with those just like with a baby	2396	A
and feed- and bottle feed them	2396	A
and we just	2396	A
oh	2396	A
um	2396	A
weren't they messy too well did she did the mother survive	2396	A
so you could still feed it but she kept them clean	2396	A
oh she didn't she didn't do something	2396	A
um	2396	A
yuck	2396	A
oh goodness	2396	A
what's a mess	2396	A
that was like oh boy they are so messy when they're little too	2396	A
we were giving them a bath about every other day- boy we were giving them a bath at least once a day but they were so horrible	2396	A
because_1 they would roll and everything and oh	2396	A
yeah	2396	A
oh i guess i had fish for a while when i was a kid too i had a fish tank	2396	A
and i had a few until	2396	A
well it wasn't really an aquarium it was an old you know how you used to have these um	2396	A
this was a box and it was originally it was it was made like an aquarium i guess except it was smaller but it was its original use was to put in the refrigerator on the shelf had a little spigot at one end	2396	A
and you could get water out of it you know keep cold water	2396	A
we outgrew the need for that	2396	A
and so i used it for an aquarium	2396	A
it worked except the fish could swim	2396	A
it wasn't tall enough i kept the if i didn't keep the the lid on it the fish would uh swim out and flop on the floor sometimes	2396	A
flip out of the thing but	2396	A
yeah	2396	A
those have been i mean and our dogs now our dogs with our kids i have two little kids three and a half and one and a half	2396	A
so we built the dog run down the length of our uh back yard	2396	A
because the kids were getting- i mean we couldn't even let our older son until he was about two i guess he was two when we built the dog run we couldn't let him go out in the back yard	2396	A
because it was we have a deck with a rail and he could go on that but the dogs were so big and he was so little	2396	A
you know they just even walking by him they'd knock- they'd knock him down and the whole the whole back yard had poop in it all the time	2396	A
it was a mess for the little one so	2396	A
now we have a back yard and a dog run	2396	A
oh that'll be nice	2396	A
yeah back and forth uh	2396	A
three and a half	2396	A
yeah	2396	A
or probably he or she is old enough to where they won't tease it too you know poke on it too much	2396	A
yeah	2396	A
because_1 that's hard ours our kids have gotten	2396	A
over it with the dogs behind it they have the the run it's kind of like a wire run	2396	A
so they go the first thing they do is they go out there and play with them but boy the little one still he just wants to poke	2396	A
my older one our older son's pretty good about it he'll pet the dog you know	2396	A
and and he's three and a half like you're saying and he he's pretty good with them and with other people's dogs and cats that he runs into	2396	A
but boy the little one still just wants to poke and	2396	A
and see if the dog will back off you know and	2396	A
yeah	2396	A
yeah i think it is too it's gonna get better	2396	A
yeah	2396	A
yeah	2396	A
i think if we didn't have pets if we didn't already have our dog and cat now we wouldn't get them because the kids are so little	2396	A
i think when they're really little like the the eighteen month old it's not fair to the animal	2396	A
because_1 the kids are so miserable to them	2396	A
if they're out very much	2396	A
yeah	2396	A
that's	2396	A
yeah and not get mad at the kid that's the other thing too that	2396	A
i i always felt Pepper the the Siberian husky is really sweet she can i think the kids could walk up and	2396	A
they could literally probably stand on her back and she wouldn't even she'd kind of look at them like what are you doing now	2396	A
she's real good natured about it	2396	A
yeah	2396	A
well i think that's about all my pet stories right now so	2396	A
okay well it's been nice talking to you	2396	A
okay bye-bye	2396	A
at the present time we have none we intend to uh purchase a pup in two months	2396	B
yes	2396	B
no we've got uh we've been married forever about eight years eight years two kids that was just	2396	B
no we've uh	2396	B
my we we've we've got a five year old but we've had one pet since we've had her but uh he didn't quite work out	2396	B
so um	2396	B
we are we've been now petless for a couple of years and	2396	B
we're going to get another one this summer we're we've a got a vacation planned and we want to wait until we get back from the vacation before we	2396	B
bring a puppy in	2396	B
yeah yeah	2396	B
what type	2396	B
uh-huh	2396	B
goodness	2396	B
right	2396	B
yeah they're big dogs	2396	B
yeah Are they primarily outdoor dogs	2396	B
yeah	2396	B
and the scratches and the smell and the uh wherever yeah	2396	B
i firmly believe that large dogs are meant to be outside we had Danes when i was a child and um	2396	B
and we had our Danes in the house	2396	B
but i mean it's almost dangerous to have them in the house	2396	B
and uh we went through a time period that we had three Danes	2396	B
we had	2396	B
yeah and we had we had had a litter	2396	B
and she had uh had thirteen puppies	2396	B
eight of which survived and uh	2396	B
and she we ended up keeping one of those puppies	2396	B
we had the mom the dad and one of the puppies and it was horrendous	2396	B
we wound up getting um get getting rid of the mom selling the puppy and just keeping the dad because dad was the favorite one anyway	2396	B
yeah	2396	B
yeah	2396	B
uh-huh	2396	B
right	2396	B
uh-huh	2396	B
oh	2396	B
yeah	2396	B
we had a Schnauzer that got milk fever right after the babies were born and we had to feed all their babies- feed all the babies there were five and there were four of them that survived	2396	B
yeah	2396	B
yeah she did survive	2396	B
no	2396	B
no she didn't even she did not even take the sack- this is the laziest dog that ever lived	2396	B
when she had these puppies she crawled up onto my mother's stomach in the middle of the bed	2396	B
had the puppies and woke up my mother	2396	B
to cut the sacks off she didn't even lick the sacks off laziest dog on earth she never she never nursed them she never cleaned them she never did anything to them they were like she- they didn't exist	2396	B
yeah	2396	B
yeah	2396	B
yeah they just poop and it's yeah they	2396	B
yeah	2396	B
like a nice aquarium	2396	B
oh yeah	2396	B
yeah	2396	B
that's great	2396	B
the cat was always happy	2396	B
uh-huh	2396	B
uh-huh	2396	B
yeah	2396	B
yeah	2396	B
uh we've uh we'll probably get real small Cairn terrier	2396	B
and it'll probably be an indoor outdoor dog	2396	B
but see my my oldest is five and a half and so she can take part in some of the uh	2396	B
responsibilities a three and a half year old really can't quite take part of many of the responsibilities maybe feeding them	2396	B
oh she's she's got respect for animals thank goodness	2396	B
uh-huh	2396	B
yeah	2396	B
i think that's eighteen months	2396	B
i mean i think that's just kids trying to figure out you know what's going to happen and it will happen again and again and again	2396	B
yeah	2396	B
yeah yeah it has to be a real uh mellow kind of animal that can	2396	B
uh	2396	B
survive it and child	2396	B
yeah	2396	B
well that's what you i mean that's what you need in a pet if your going to have small children too	2396	B
but	2396	B
we uh	2396	B
oh wonderful	2396	B
i'm just flat out of pet stories i don't even have a pet anymore	2396	B
well thanks thanks for calling bye-bye	2396	B
oh really	2311	B
oh	2311	B
geez that's great	2311	B
um-hum	2311	B
um-hum do you work during the day	2311	B
oh	2311	B
oh i it's a good idea	2311	B
um-hum	2311	B
um-hum	2311	B
oh okay well that's good well i um i work actually in a different sort of environment i work in a uh personnel agency a temporary agency	2311	B
and so for me i'm always out with customers or with uh employees and i practically have to wear a suit everyday	2311	B
oh really well uh	2311	B
um-hum	2311	B
uh-huh	2311	B
um-hum	2311	B
oh well at least there's you know does she wear the same size	2311	B
oh wow that's great well	2311	B
uh-huh	2311	B
um-hum um-hum	2311	B
um-hum the the thing that kills me is that we have dress down days sometimes at work you know where can throw on jeans and i swear i can sleep an extra half an hour	2311	B
if i don't have to get up and put on panty hose and fix the skirt and button shirts and you-	2311	B
you know i i just i love it when i can get up and throw on sweats or just throw on jeans and tie sneakers and and i'm fine	2311	B
um-hum	2311	B
right plus ironing the suit on top of that you know	2311	B
yeah right that's true that's true	2311	B
yep exactly	2311	B
when it comes to Winter though my my goal is to stay warm	2311	B
and i don't even care how i look i mean i i'll have	2311	B
and so um i i mean i don't even touch shoes- shoes when i'm outdoors i just wear boots and like two pairs of socks and	2311	B
yeah	2311	B
right well i'll only do that on Fridays	2311	B
Fridays are you know a little bit more relaxed day	2311	B
yeah	2311	B
yep	2311	B
oh yeah me too	2311	B
um-hum	2311	B
oh it's really horrible um i it got so- Rochester gets so cold that sometimes i'll just have to wear like leggings until i get to work	2311	B
and take them off because it really really does get cold but um	2311	B
i would love a job where i didn't it it wouldn't be casual all the time but i didn't have to be dressy all the time and i could wear more fun clothes	2311	B
you know what i mean	2311	B
uh-huh	2311	B
oh really	2311	B
um-hum	2311	B
um-hum	2311	B
and in the Summer it's hard because_1 it's so hot	2311	B
you just	2311	B
oh that's great	2311	B
oh	2311	B
uh-huh	2311	B
um-hum	2311	B
i know	2311	B
yeah	2311	B
right which is like adding another layer	2311	B
um-hum i know	2311	B
yeah	2311	B
yeah i know	2311	B
oh geez well you know it doesn't seem fair for because guys i mean i feel like all they have to do is change a tie	2311	B
and they've got a whole new outfit	2311	B
well that's true	2311	B
yeah they have to keep looking sort of clean and pressed	2311	B
yeah	2311	B
yeah	2311	B
that's true	2311	B
i know and then you know if you run one forget it you not only lose- you know spend another four bucks but	2311	B
you know take that extra time and i mean another thing that kills me is i walk in heels all day and i wear out the bottom of my shoes so quickly on the pavement and and i'm spending like you know	2311	B
instead of buying new shoes i'm always repairing them and again that's like four dollars each time to bring in a pair of shoes and get new heels put on	2311	B
um-hum the the nails start showing through and that sort of thing	2311	B
yeah	2311	B
oh well i'm too short to wear flats if i wore	2311	B
oh	2311	B
uh-huh	2311	B
oh jeez oh it must be painful yeah	2311	B
do you stand all day at your job or you	2311	B
um-hum that's great	2311	B
um-hum	2311	B
um-hum	2311	B
um-hum	2311	B
good for you	2311	B
that's great	2311	B
well i'll be thinking of you dressing casually at night when i go to work	2311	B
oh yeah it's i- i was timing it because_1 i came in uh it's been about seven minutes	2311	B
okay_1	2311	B
yeah well Linda take care it was really nice talking to you	2311	B
no have you	2311	B
oh	2311	B
that would be fun though	2311	B
just- pick up where you left off	2311	B
{alrighty}	2311	B
take care bye-bye	2311	B
this is like one of the worst topics i've had because i'm a terrible dresser	2311	A
i'm really not that bad of a dresser but um where i work um it's very casual dressing	2311	A
so i can wear jeans and um pretty much a sweater or even a T-shirt to work it- it-	2311	A
yeah well we i work in a manufacturing plant so we don't i don't have to deal with customers or anything but-	2311	A
no actually i'm at work right now i work at night and i'm using this phone as one of my you have to have two phones i'm using one of these	2311	A
yeah well i sit here i'm taking a course and i study when i study- when i uh read my course while i'm trying to get through so i'm just make a couple a night though	2311	A
oh you see that's i almost wish i had a job like that so it would force me to dress nice	2311	A
yeah because i can slough off and then when it comes things out or or i go out to dinner or something or or not not so much going out to dinner i have like three or four dresses that i can wear something like- business interview	2311	A
yeah well- and it's it's really convenient we're twins too so it works out	2311	A
yeah she just had to change her whole wardrobe because she's going up like a management ladder and even though she still has to work i mean do some lot of physical work and adjust her machines	2311	A
um she still has to dress for success as they say	2311	A
so she went out and she changed her whole her whole wardrobe	2311	A
yeah	2311	A
that's true yep	2311	A
i know because you know even like i ironed a shirt to come to work tonight you know just a nice blouse and if i was going to wear it with a suit or something i would have had done a a ten times better job	2311	A
yeah and it's- it's got to be more expensive	2311	A
yep but that's what's you have when when you have to deal with the public or deal with the customers they like that that business suit- suit	2311	A
right	2311	A
do	2311	A
boots	2311	A
do you have to do you find that you you can are- are you happy with wearing dress slacks instead of dresses because_1 i know a lot of people who dress it's usually dresses dresses they hardly- hardly don't wear dress pants or anything	2311	A
yeah	2311	A
see all the girls that i know i know a couple girls that work in insurance offices and that's all they they wear are dresses they hardly ever wear pants then on the weekends you know they wear their jeans and their sweats	2311	A
but they- they uh the pants just aren't dressy enough but in the wintertime i think i would be wearing pants	2311	A
yeah- yeah	2311	A
yeah	2311	A
yeah even even here the secretaries they usually dress nice but it's not strange to seem them in jeans and a sweater	2311	A
so and you know sometimes it is on Fridays but in the summertime if they're going to like i know a couple of the girls and this one lady goes camping a lot and like every Friday she's she's- you know she still does her same function and everything	2311	A
but uh normally she's dressed to the T she's just perfect	2311	A
yeah well we're fortunate here because_1 the building's um very um climate controlled	2311	A
but we work in an electronics field and we have to wear polyester smocks so it's usually um a tank top in the Summer and then silk and polyester are the only things that are close enough to being dressy	2311	A
and they and polyester's terrible on me and i wear my silk under this polyester uh smock and you just get so hot even though it's a nice temperature in here so you really in the summertime have to	2311	A
we have to dress extra light because we have to wear these smocks	2311	A
yeah and in the wintertime pretty much just uh um even a turtleneck's all right because you have to wear these smocks a turtleneck and a sweater and the smock would be too much it it gets really hot	2311	A
so it's kind of weird when it's really cold we- we come in pretty much we have- take our coat off and then we take our outside sweater off	2311	A
trucking through the parking lot	2311	A
yeah	2311	A
but they still they have to keep the pants really just	2311	A
but	2311	A
yeah and their shirts have to be pressed so they still have the same thing where if they could dress casually it would take them less time too	2311	A
but i know what it's like i mean just putting on a pair of panty hose can take you an extra five minutes	2311	A
yeah	2311	A
oh i know um even my dress shoes i don't wear them_1 a lot i notice the wear on the bottom of them	2311	A
and there's no way i could wear them all day i would be the one of the women in flats	2311	A
well i'm pretty short but i have a very bad knee i couldn't	2311	A
couldn't walk in heels all day when i go dancing i i- i going out i'm like i- i stand the ball on my foot hoping i don't slip on my heel because if my if i stand- if i jam down on my heel too much my knee doesn't catch and	2311	A
it's bad well it's	2311	A
no we don't at all um we used to be a lot busier so um we it used to be important what you wore if you're comfortable because_1 you knew you were going to spend a lot of time working	2311	A
and now it's very slow and i pretty much i've taken a couple courses and now- now i sit at my desk and i and i read read my courses	2311	A
i'm a technician so i've taken a couple technical courses plus i go take a couple college courses like- i've taken um some business courses	2311	A
just uh it's gets boring to stay here technical courses learning about power supplies in computers and yeah	2311	A
yeah this	2311	A
okay	2311	A
okay so it do you think it's been five minutes see i never time these	2311	A
oh okay so we can end our call okay	2311	A
yeah oh who knows did- did you have you ever gotten duplicate people	2311	A
no i you- i'm almost afraid to get duplicate people i don't know why	2311	A
okay well	2311	A
yeah okay okay_1 bye yeah you too	2311	A
i watch the MacNeil Lehrer news hour and i subscribe to the paper on the weekends	2395	B
i'm in Dallas	2395	B
are you in Dallas also	2395	B
oh really okay	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
oh really	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
i normally find that uh i- i'm probably the most um news hungry of my friends so i don't we don't normally talk about the news at lunch	2395	B
i i find that i have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend simply because i used to get it during the week	2395	B
but um i would always end up arriving at work late because i would always end up skimming the headlines spending too much time reading it in the morning	2395	B
so i have to cut myself down to the weekend plus after work um the MacNeil Lehrer news hour is on uh public television and i enjoy that quite a bit	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
i will admit i work with uh someone who's Iranian	2395	B
and he definitely has a very different slant on the news he's very very skeptical of the news media and i will admit i'm reasonably skeptical also	2395	B
but he's i don't know uh he's	2395	B
much- much much more so it's it's sort of interesting though because he does bring a a much um different perspective with all the Gulf goings on um	2395	B
he was always speaking in terms of you know American imperialism reasserting itself and i suppose it's a different attitude that we normally don't hear in the country	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
true um the	2395	B
they um tend to spend	2395	B
quite a bit of time on one story they will have maybe two or three main stories and just spend a very large amount of time sort of like the uh what is that ABC's Nightline	2395	B
uh well i guess they only normally stick with just the one um story but they they can do a much better job since they don't have to chop it into little two minute stories	2395	B
no no it's very much national interest news a lot of times they end up um	2395	B
with these panels of experts and they go back and forth where everyone's giving some opinions and sometimes that i i don't know the value of that because um i saw plenty of jokes and and um	2395	B
oh editorial cartoons about all the retired generals making their living during the the Gulf War	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
i will admit it's interesting i i i'm twenty six so i don't have any more experience in that than you um	2395	B
it it it was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe to grind you know there were some that were screaming for air power there were some that were saying the air power wasn't going to do it and they seemed to mold the events	2395	B
to their view of the world which i suppose just about everyone does but these guys had a a uh national soap box to stand on and and express this view	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
yeah i i didn't see anything like that although i did uh i guess one thing that i found sort of interesting this is getting a little off the topic but	2395	B
there there is a a big push you know- with the local T V stations to have little hot lines with um counselors	2395	B
to to help parents uh learn how to talk about their war with their children i thought that was a really unusual thing	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
it- it with the children's aspect um-hum	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
i suppose that is a valuable service that again not having uh lived through another war i don't know if that's a common thing that people thought of or if that was	2395	B
a a new concern with people	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
that's true that's true	2395	B
and probably more importantly one that lasted short enough that that people's interest didn't {flauge} too badly	2395	B
i will admit the same thing i would come home and flip on MacNeil Lehrer and they would run these extended two three hour versions of the program and i i was just i was	2395	B
horrified and fascinated by what i was seeing	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
i i didn't have that experience i i don't have cable so i i'm pretty much limited to PBS which i thought i thought they did a very good job	2395	B
um i've got one question for you i	2395	B
you say you take the newspaper	2395	B
um	2395	B
i i found the newspaper situation in Dallas very interesting we've got	2395	B
the one fairly well relatively weaker paper the Times Herald and then the Morning News which has a very strong subscription	2395	B
does San Antonio have- you said San Antonio right	2395	B
do you have just one paper or do you have several	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
i i actually take both newspapers on the weekends i figure i'm only taking on the weekend and i can afford that i i find the news reporting in the the	2395	B
Mourning News to be better but i i sort of have a liberal political slant and the Mourning News just has an incredibly conservative editorial um outlook	2395	B
still i i get the Times Herald just to balance that out a little bit	2395	B
um-hum	2395	B
where do you get most of your news	2395	A
where where are you oh yeah	2395	A
no i'm in San Antonio	2395	A
um-hum i get my news from a combination of sources i take the the paper everyday and i read it on the way in to work on the in a carpool uh-huh and uh	2395	A
and i watch the uh actually i watch the morning news before i leave for work and then you know usually over lunch there'll be a big topic of conversation on something from the news	2395	A
um-hum	2395	A
oh yeah	2395	A
um-hum	2395	A
yeah um one of the women that i work with her husband is Iranian	2395	A
so here lately with all the Middle Eastern news we've had some very interesting conversations over lunch	2395	A
um-hum	2395	A
um-hum	2395	A
well i i uh i like the print news much better than the television news because television news tends to sensationalize	2395	A
i understand that the MacNeil Lehrer probably doesn't	2395	A
um-hum	2395	A
um-hum	2395	A
they don't report on every murder and shooting that happened in in every little town	2395	A
yeah	2395	A
i've been getting a kick out of those lately	2395	A
although um	2395	A
i'm i'm only twenty five so i've never actually been through a period of war and i don't know anyone in the military and i don't have a lot of background knowledge in uh	2395	A
military strategy and and weaponry and and all that kind of stuff and i thought the generals were very interesting now when they started to speculate i	2395	A
i saw that for what it was and thought all of these guys don't know what's going on but i thought they were they- they were interesting and and they shed some light on what was going on for me	2395	A
um-hum	2395	A
um-hum	2395	A
you know one of the the best uh television news shows that i saw during the war was a show on a Saturday morning on ABC and it was for children and it was hosted by Peter Jennings	2395	A
and it was so interesting because they were relating the war to these children in their studio and they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions	2395	A
and they they had all their correspondents in the different areas in Saudi Arabia and Israel and and all they had them all uh	2395	A
on i don't know what you'd call it other than on line they had them all on hold and if a child asked a question that the person in Jerusalem could best answer they would cut to that person and that person would answer the question it was just very	2395	A
informative and interesting and uh i was real impressed at how ABC handled uh	2395	A
translating the war for children	2395	A
um-hum	2395	A
and our local HEB stores here i don't know if it's HEB statewide or whatever but they have videos	2395	A
that uh i don't know if they still have them but they were free rental videos that had something to do with the war	2395	A
uh it was it was	2395	A
right it was something for children	2395	A
that that they they had several advertisements on television pushing parents going and and uh getting the video and watching it with their children and discussing it and that kind of thing	2395	A
well	2395	A
back during the Vietnam conflict that no one will will have the guts enough to call a real war uh	2395	A
the that type of technology just wasn't at people's disposal	2395	A
so i don't think there's ever been a war that's been so thoroughly	2395	A
covered by the news	2395	A
yeah i tell you what the first three days i was glued to the television	2395	A
and i had	2395	A
yeah	2395	A
i tell you what the the uh war started- let's see was it a Wednesday or Thursday must have been Thursday	2395	A
um and Friday night i was i stayed up until two o'clock in the morning sitting right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open	2395	A
because i was watching CNN and they would they would switch back to the one of their Israel bureaus and the people would be standing there in gas masks and you'd be hearing the sirens and it was just i was amazed	2395	A
oh	2395	A
um-hum	2395	A
uh-huh	2395	A
um-hum	2395	A
um-hum	2395	A
no there are two and they're pretty close	2395	A
uh the one that i picked is more similar in format to the newspaper i grew up near Houston and there are two major newspapers there that run pretty much neck and neck	2395	A
and the one i picked here had the same format as the one that my parents took as i was growing up i mean the same type of typeface on the headline and that kind of stuff i mean it's- it's	2395	A
{piddley} stuff to pick a newspaper over and i enjoy the comics are better in this newspaper like this newspaper has The Far Side and some other comics that i enjoy and the other one has some weird ones that i've never heard of so	2395	A
yeah	2395	A
and my fiancee-	2395	A
my fiancee takes probably six Sunday papers He takes both San Antonio papers an Austin paper both Houston papers i guess he takes seven the San Marcos paper and the New Braunsfel paper	2395	A
but he's a football coach at Southwest Texas State University so he's getting all the sports sections	2395	A
and so you know he has these stacks of Sunday newspapers that go unread unless	2395	A
okay what kind of books do you like to read for enjoyment	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
what kind of business is it	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
well that sounds interesting- that sounds fun what kind of business is it	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
really	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
well that's interesting	2354	A
a what	2354	A
oh really well that sounds interesting my mom always wants me to open a health food store but i'll i'm not really into it i don't know the information- i don't know that much about it so anyway but well that's interesting i personally i like mostly	2354	A
um if i had a book of my choice i like books i go to the library a lot and it seems like i always i never go to the fiction section i mean that to me is just ridiculous it's like life is to interesting to read fiction but	2354	A
i always get books like um i like to quilt well i'm not into quilting but i check a lot of books out to learn how i just haven't done it yet because it seems to monstrous to do with a book but	2354	A
i like to um can and do food preservation and mostly canning just for fun to go pick the things and just to have fun doing it and to give them as gifts and stuff	2354	A
and i like to check books out like that and i always come away with i'm a Christian and i enjoy reading books about um i like- i have a real heart for people involved in cults	2354	A
and so i have a real you know heart for them and i'm going to bring my Mormon neighbors some Amish bread today and that's just where my heart is so i read a lot of books on that and	2354	A
and you know Christian books written by people about you know to help you out and stuff and	2354	A
i read the Bible i don't read the Bible as much as i should but but i think i would always think that no matter what i did so but i do enjoy reading that and so pretty much we have different interests i think in reading	2354	A
but and i have a neighbor with a big motorbike and he likes to run down the street with it and you you can probably hear him but um i don't know so do you enjoy reading anything like that um	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
thirty or younger	2354	A
is that what you said	2354	A
oh ten years younger oh that's funny	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
oh really	2354	A
yeah Maureen Solomon i had a a friend of mine has a book by her right now called Foods That Heal	2354	A
they eat a lot of it you know you can take your vitamins and she was telling me to take zinc	2354	A
so anyway i've been taking enough zinc you know to kill a horse probably i hope it doesn't hurt me but anyway i did read one chapter of that	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
no i haven't	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
the quantities and	2354	A
what's the name of it again	2354	A
Life Extension	2354	A
um-hum	2354	A
uh-huh oh really	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
um-hum	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
really	2354	A
um-hum	2354	A
oh really	2354	A
really	2354	A
i know there's not any food that you can get	2354	A
and it's grown on good soil hardly anymore and i know my my husband's uncle owns a big- um some acreage in a Eastland Texas which is in West Texas	2354	A
and he owns a lot of acreage that's been farmed properly you know and uh we get black eyed peas off of it and stuff but	2354	A
i know that you know the further we go from Adam the worse the food is for you but God still somehow makes us all	2354	A
be able to still live i think it's a miracle we're all still alive after so many generations well the last couple of processed foods you know i mean but	2354	A
i don't know i like to i like to my i like to be able to eat really healthy you know what am saying and i guess i'm going to have to wait for the millennium i think though because i do don't think we're going to restore the earth to you know i think Jesus is the only one that can make this earth be restored to what it should be	2354	A
but uh in the meantime we pray over our food because i'm always looking down my plate and i think man isn't this stuff was probably grown in who knows what you know kind of environment but	2354	A
i do take some vitamins on the side and i do like reading books like that i just	2354	A
i have a hard time a lot of the books are real new age oriented like Mother Earth and we're going to restore the earth i just don't see that i think	2354	A
i mean think to think that is almost it's hopeless to think that man can do anything with the you know what i'm saying it's to big than us and i think God's in charge and God's going to restore it when he wants to so sometimes i get bogged down in the	2354	A
you know in the ideology that motivates a lot of health food and motivates a lot of vitamin taking but you know there's a balance in it sometimes i read stuff like that and then i just chunk off like water off your back some of it and	2354	A
you know and try and do what's what i can do out of it that's practical but anyway so	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
because it's what	2354	A
oh	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
uh-huh	2354	A
um	2354	A
really	2354	A
really you know i bet that's why we have some friends that eat only i just took this Amish bread out of the oven man it's going to be good i had a starter that friend of mine made anyway uh i had a friend that read a book on that	2354	A
and um i've all my relatives my mom- you know you probably read Back To Eden or something i don't know we read a lot i know people have read all those books but	2354	A
the um they drilled- they drilled a well i don't know how many feet but it was three or four times deeper than it needed to be	2354	A
and so their water comes out they live in Grand Prairie but it's they live kind of in a the planes go right over from DFW so it's not real developed and so they have a probably half an acre	2354	A
and yeah and they drilled this well and the water comes out at thirty two degrees so it's kinds of neat would that be healthier do to do that to drill your own fresh water well like that	2354	A
uh mainly the the books i read are uh business related	2354	B
or self improvement um i've got a a uh small company on the side	2354	B
that i that i do things with so uh a lot of the reading that i i do has to do with um how can i uh do better at at my small time business uh	2354	B
important issues such as a you know taxes and	2354	B
business expenses and all those kind things	2354	B
um i've got a uh small distributorship uh i uh	2354	B
sell a uh	2354	B
healthy cookie on the side	2354	B
and uh i have a few health food stores that i send it to i can buy the cookies in a larger quantity than they can so i can get a deal from the uh from the main- from the supplier	2354	B
and then i distributed them and then i can- i get i can sell them at a cheaper price plus i've got a uh drinking water system business that i've had on the side for years that i've done	2354	B
a drinking water business uh yeah yeah	2354	B
uh-huh	2354	B
uh-huh	2354	B
sounds like it	2354	B
uh-huh	2354	B
um i haven't really read anything like that in in in years there was a time when i was really into the home things and i did uh had my own garden and i did canning all those kind of things that was when i was about uh ten years younger	2354	B
and uh had	2354	B
about ten years younger yeah	2354	B
and um uh the- the problem that i've i've had in the past with uh my children growing up and moving out of the house and and still having three left at home out of the five um i've	2354	B
tried to devote more time to them and trying to get them interested in in reading more and and spending more time at the library and it i've been moderately successful	2354	B
uh with my daughter and with my son they both have different interests in books but um they they uh they do read them um	2354	B
i have some books on on health that i read all the time one's on vitamins that are good for you and that kind of thing but yeah i i'm	2354	B
uh-huh	2354	B
there's a uh a couple called um oh i'm going to forgot his name now uh Dirkson	2354	B
um and uh there's a book called Life Extensions i don't know if you've ever heard of it	2354	B
okay it's a book called Life Extensions there's also a book called The Life Extension Companion uh Dirk Pearson and	2354	B
oh i forgot Sally's last name	2354	B
anyway it's a couple i've i've seen them on TV	2354	B
and uh they have- they are pretty down to earth about uh	2354	B
what you can take and and what you can't take and um	2354	B
the quantities what are good for you what isn't and um Life Extensions	2354	B
uh yeah he's probably about forty years old now i saw him probably seven years ago on Johnny Carson Show	2354	B
and uh i was pretty impressed he had a he before he started out on his experiments he had a battery of tests done on his body to determine the age of each one of his organs	2354	B
you know based on how well it was performing and then he embarked on this uh vitamin treatment and then every year he had the same tests run	2354	B
and at the age of thirty two i think it was his um heart was that of a fourteen year old	2354	B
and all the rest of his organs were all greatly you know all tested out greatly below his actual age	2354	B
and of course Sally uh isn't a very big woman i mean she's you know she appeared to me to be very petite and um she took a horse shoe and and turned it turned it into an S	2354	B
and uh it was all from taking the right vitamins and things that that give you the strength and of course doing isometric exercises	2354	B
uh together they both exercised about five minutes a day doing isometrics rather than you know physical strenuous exercises	2354	B
uh-huh	2354	B
yes	2354	B
uh-huh	2354	B
yes	2354	B
yeah there's i've i've read a lot of things um since i got involved in the water business back in eighty three um and it's amazing that the the legislation they have	2354	B
um for food that doesn't apply to water they don't consider water a food and uh the basics premise is that if water was a food it would be you know they wouldn't be able to sell it to you	2354	B
through your pipes because it's toxic um chlorine it's toxic it's a i don't know if your on city water city water has chlorine in it chlorine causes cancer	2354	B
they know that they've proven that	2354	B
um yet their saying well we're putting such low doses in there that well you don't have to worry about dying from it the problem is that i've i've read books that	2354	B
uh have proven that there is a link between the {ingestation} of chlorine and arteriosclerosis which is heart attack	2354	B
and if you look at the history of heart attacks heart attacks were nonexistent prior to nineteen twenty	2354	B
and we started doing um large quantities of chlorination of water starting around uh where we experimented with it in nineteen oh three and nineteen thirteen most of the major cities had chlorinated water	2354	B
uh-huh	2354	B
yeah i'm very familiar with the area	2354	B
it depends a lot of uh a lot of things were thought that uh as you know the farmers thought okay we got chemicals we're putting chemicals on the field well the ground will naturally filter out the	2354	B
so what TV shows do you like do you like comedies or	2312	A
uh-huh	2312	A
do you like uh do you like Cheers	2312	A
Cheers-	2312	A
Night Court	2312	A
yeah i i think that's pretty much what i like is my favorite TV show is Cheers and then after that is uh Night Court	2312	A
but i also i also like Star Trek and that's kind of an adventure i guess you would call it	2312	A
yeah	2312	A
yeah that's true	2312	A
yeah especially like uh have you have you seen that movie uh Dances with Wolves	2312	A
you don't want to see it it's like three hours long and it just drags on forever	2312	A
well i like i mean i like you know things that are funny and and and don't you know like like Cheers you know is really funny it it makes you laugh or you know so it's not like uh uh a show that goes on forever even though it's only half an hour	2312	A
yeah something to remove you know something to remove me from reality for a little while get away from real life	2312	A
because_1 i i mean i don't know it's just something i think something we need	2312	A
as you know as human beings something to remove you from reality to relieve the stress	2312	A
and Cheers does it i don't know i like the way i like the way the people act in Cheers it's it's pretty funny it's it's kind of you know the extremes of of certain characters	2312	A
yeah the syndicate	2312	A
yeah they when when they'll show one one episode in one channel and like in the next day they'll show it on another one	2312	A
yeah	2312	A
right where i where i where i'm at right now is in a dorm and we don't have the uh we don't have cable so i just get regular TV but	2312	A
we see it uh every day at six o'clock	2312	A
yeah right and then the new one comes on at nine Thursdays	2312	A
yeah	2312	A
well how about the Wonder Years do you like the Wonder Years	2312	A
that's pretty good i mean it's it's not something you see every day so it's i guess it that that keeps the quality a little higher	2312	A
uh-huh so it's even closer to you	2312	A
uh-huh	2312	A
i never ever really got into Bob Newhart	2312	A
no i don't i don't i never never saw that	2312	A
i kind of i kind of stayed away from the TV for a couple of years when i first came up here	2312	A
so i you know there's a gap in my TV viewing but recently that's basically what i watch is Cheers and	2312	A
and uh	2312	A
and Night Court because they're right- they show them back to back	2312	A
yeah	2312	A
well	2312	A
yeah	2312	A
no i don't i don't i don't particularly get into those shows because it's they're they- they don't keep my interest i- i've seen um L A Law i think once or twice and and the episode wasn't that great so i just i figured they were all like that so i don't waste my time	2312	A
looking at that and you know and if it's if it's funny or if it keeps my interest if it's exciting i'll watch it if not i don't and times that i saw that or pieces of that it wasn't any wasn't great	2312	A
Thirty Something i watched a few times because_1 there was a few good episodes and then after that it it i just lost interest in it	2312	A
but uh i guess it's because it's not aimed for an audience of my age	2312	A
no i'm i'm in my twenties my early twenties and so	2312	A
i guess Thirty Something is not is definitely not for me	2312	A
uh-huh	2312	A
yeah well	2312	A
that that way you'll you'll get to see all the shows and you get to really form good opinions on which one is really good and which one is is really	2312	A
yeah	2312	A
what was wise guy	2312	A
oh	2312	A
i mean i heard of it before but i never i never seen it	2312	A
did you have you ever seen that that show they i mean they they trashed it before it ever got started but it was like i think they showed a couple of shows of uh what is it a Cop Rocks or something like that	2312	A
i heard i heard it really sucked	2312	A
because uh it was supposed to be something like a show- uh singing and like like a musical but yeah	2312	A
like a musical like right in the middle of acting they would sing songs or something	2312	A
no	2312	A
i can see why it crashed	2312	A
well it was nice talking to you	2312	A
yeah	2312	A
oh well i'll get off the phone and let you watch it then and good luck on your recovery	2312	A
all right bye	2312	A
i like comedies and i like sitcoms i like to watch TV for escape i'm not much interested in	2312	B
yeah i like that and i like L A Law and i like Thirty Something	2312	B
i like Night Court	2312	B
in fact it's on right now	2312	B
yeah i never really got involved in Star Trek	2312	B
and i don't really care to watch movies because	2312	B
it's committing too much time i think	2312	B
you know you never know what's going to come up you know if you commit thirty minutes or an hour to watch some TV shows it's a little different than	2312	B
you know two hours for a movie especially you know things that are i hate things that are continued	2312	B
no i haven't	2312	B
that's what i've heard	2312	B
i think	2312	B
yeah and it's a just a nice escape	2312	B
and you know it's something to laugh at and enjoy and	2312	B
right	2312	B
exactly	2312	B
exactly that's that's what i like	2312	B
yeah	2312	B
yeah yeah you're right about the other you're right they are now that i think about it	2312	B
yeah i watch it it's on here- it's on here um like three or four times a night on various cable channels	2312	B
well yeah but right- um let's see here they've got it	2312	B
they've got it at like six six or six thirty and then they have it again at ten and ten thirty you know on a different channel	2312	B
and so you know	2312	B
oh okay	2312	B
uh-huh the older one	2312	B
yeah	2312	B
i'm trying to think what other shows i like there there's just oh just television has changed so much and uh	2312	B
there's just not as many really good shows on i think as there used to be	2312	B
i guess a lot of people think that the shows that i watch are kind of stupid and most of my friends and the people i know don't	2312	B
yeah i like that	2312	B
well yeah and what i like about that show is that the time the time period that that takes place in is exactly the age i was during that time period so	2312	B
yeah it's kind of funny to you know sit back and remember it brings back a lot of memories	2312	B
um	2312	B
i don't know i like do you like um i don't know if if you're	2312	B
you would know like Barney Miller do you ever	2312	B
watch that or the old Bob Newhart Show	2312	B
never got into those	2312	B
the old- i'm talking about the old one when he was a psychologist	2312	B
don't remember those	2312	B
i don't know my friends don't like my TV TV they think it's trashy but uh	2312	B
well yeah	2312	B
yeah	2312	B
back to back when i was in college you know we didn't have TVs	2312	B
and so i remember somebody happened to have one in their room it was a really big deal and everybody'd get together like one night a week to watch TV but	2312	B
but uh	2312	B
sounds like we have real similar tastes- we have- tastes i mean as far as the sitcoms go do you what about the do you like L A Law or	2312	B
is that all	2312	B
uh-huh	2312	B
yeah	2312	B
um	2312	B
yeah probably not	2312	B
about ten years	2312	B
yeah ten years down the road for you but um	2312	B
those are really the only two drama shows that i like	2312	B
and i tell everybody don't call me	2312	B
but other than that i you know i like i um i'm recovering from surgery and so i read and watch a lot of television so	2312	B
i get to see just about everything	2312	B
yeah but who cares about my opinion	2312	B
i like the uh	2312	B
i don't know it seems like that some of the best shows they take off the air one of my favorite shows was Wise Guy and they took that off the air	2312	B
it was a cop show	2312	B
but	2312	B
yeah i have to stay up if i want to see it i have to stay up till eleven thirty and then it's all reruns and the guy that was started out in it isn't in it and anyway it's a long	2312	B
i heard a lot about it but i never saw it now	2312	B
did it	2312	B
oh really	2312	B
you're kidding	2312	B
maybe i should have surely it maybe it would have been pretty funny i don't know	2312	B
i don't think it was supposed to be funny though	2312	B
you know	2312	B
nice talking to you i guess you'll get to watch all of Night Court	2312	B
i'm sorry i'm just teasing thanks	2312	B
bye bye	2312	B
well i think uh NCAA is going to go to Kansas	2374	B
they just won it	2374	B
holy cow i just walked in i i didn't even i guess it's i can't believe it's over already-	2374	B
what was the score	2374	B
well i suppose they must be still must be pretty good if they took on UNLV so	2374	B
well you and everybody else	2374	B
well a lot of pressure on them_1 though i think uh	2374	B
i don't think they had the same type of enthusiasm- -enthusiasm or attitude	2374	B
probably too conservative or too	2374	B
uh	2374	B
yeah	2374	B
yeah	2374	B
well what about professionally	2374	B
i'm out in uh Phoenix- uh Phoenix there so the Suns are starting to look pretty descent but there i think yeah	2374	B
yeah	2374	B
well i used to live out there and uh seems like they've well Tarpley just got pulled over again	2374	B
who who else do they got on that team now i	2374	B
yeah	2374	B
yeah	2374	B
yeah how's he doing this year	2374	B
how about the guy from North Carolina	2374	B
Perkins Perkins-	2374	B
that's right that's right okay_1	2374	B
yeah he was a finesse player he was good	2374	B
Dantely didn't they get Dantely	2374	B
i think that was involved with the Perkins- Perkins trade to tell you the truth	2374	B
oh oh no no no no no no it was what is his name McGuire that was	2374	B
McGuire yeah	2374	B
yeah	2374	B
i don't understand that i thought that he was always a good player	2374	B
are they over five hundred	2374	B
um-hum	2374	B
yeah	2374	B
yeah i think i think the Suns are	2374	B
well they had i don't think it was last year the year before they were doing really good and i think they had an off year last year	2374	B
did you say white or black	2374	B
Chambers	2374	B
yeah	2374	B
he's the big guy yeah	2374	B
i haven't been i don't follow basketball real close but	2374	B
yeah	2374	B
the big ten didn't fair too well in the tournament	2374	B
i'm i'm from the midwest so	2374	B
yeah	2374	B
yeah i kind of watch- you know see what's happening	2374	B
but uh	2374	B
what's that	2374	B
well no basketball is you know Michigan won it last year	2374	B
yeah Indiana and Michigan uh	2374	B
and uh Iowa and	2374	B
Ohio State Ohio State was ranked like number two most of the year	2374	B
Michigan won the NCAA last year and and you know there's always	2374	B
about six teams that go to the tournament	2374	B
uh from the big ten it's it's	2374	B
they are they're really good in all the sports they	2374	B
actually in the last few years um	2374	B
football you know looks like has gone down a little bit so	2374	B
yeah	2374	B
and uh	2374	B
yeah we'll see	2374	B
{alrighty} well uh have a good one	2374	B
okay bye-bye	2374	B
well who's the team	2374	A
oh really well i i'm picking Duke because_1 uh they just won it	2374	A
yeah	2374	A
it's just yeah it's just over just uh about five- ten minutes ago i guess it was a good game uh they won by about eight i think	2374	A
either five or eight it was a good game	2374	A
but uh Duke was just too much for them_1 Kansas just couldn't couldn't hang with them	2374	A
oh yeah and see i was i was really thinking that they might have a let down because_1 i i i was in a basketball pot and i picked uh Kansas for i guess more or less an upset but i i was thinking that uh	2374	A
Duke might have a let down after playing such a tough game with UNLV but uh i tell you what they uh they came back and put it to them_1	2374	A
it was a good game	2374	A
but i i i had thought all the way through that UNLV was going to be the team that would just walk away with it	2374	A
that's right that's right i tell you what they uh they they looked like they were just men among boys	2374	A
but they they they fell i tell you	2374	A
yeah yeah they they just need to go for it instead of uh worrying about the other team because_1 i think if they would play their game i don't know if there's anybody that could that could keep up with them	2374	A
but	2374	A
uh i i was since the	2374	A
yeah that's right	2374	A
yeah here in Dallas i'll tell you what the the Mavericks are having just all kinds of problems	2374	A
i tell you	2374	A
oh really	2374	A
yeah so he he's uh he's probably going to be going to jail and and the problem with him is he's on a guaranteed salary like for three years so whether he plays or not they've got to pay him ten million dollars so if they	2374	A
uh they can't hardly trade him because_1 nobody wants to pay that much for him and if they just keep him that hurts their salary cap so that guy's got Dallas in a big old bind	2374	A
but uh they they i think they've just got to forget about him and uh try to build a team without him	2374	A
maybe go for some good they ought to get some good draft picks this year	2374	A
they've uh they've got Derek Harper that's a real good point guard him and Rolando Blackman	2374	A
and uh really they're about it they've got a guy named Herb Williams that that i guess sort of was supposed to take the place of uh Tarpley but he uh he just doesn't have the offensive skills	2374	A
and then they've got James Donaldson who's been there forever playing center and uh	2374	A
just all right but he's getting to where uh i don't know if it's his age or what but he just can't play the whole game they've got to get somebody young that can uh run the court that's still big	2374	A
oh uh	2374	A
not McCrae but uh	2374	A
let's see are you uh Perkins	2374	A
they traded Perkins Sam Perkins they traded him he was from North Carolina and uh they traded him to the Lakers last year and that he was a good player and then they they've got a	2374	A
yeah	2374	A
and then they they uh last year went out and got oh Fat Leever and uh Alex English and and Rodney McCrae	2374	A
yeah they didn't and i'm not for sure what the deal is on him i think he's been hurt but he hadn't played	2374	A
he hadn't played in probably two months	2374	A
and i've i've gone to about three or four of their games and i don't even think he was on the sidelines so i i think he hurt his knee or something but he he definitely didn't turn out to be anything like he was supposed to	2374	A
so uh	2374	A
it uh you know i i bet it was	2374	A
that's right that's right from uh uh Detroit that's right that's who that was yeah because_1 i don't think they got anything from Perkins i think he was a free agent or uh	2374	A
yeah free agent his contract ended and they didn't sign him	2374	A
and uh	2374	A
you know he was but he just went for the the big bucks i think	2374	A
Dallas was going to pay him like sixteen million over five years and he got something like eighteen or nineteen million from Las Angeles so he just went where the bucks were	2374	A
and shoot you can't blame him man that's that's a phenomenal amount of money	2374	A
but uh yeah the Mavericks are sucking it up i tell you	2374	A
uh no i don't think so they they were right before the uh uh	2374	A
oh what do you call it- all-star break but ever since the all-star break uh	2374	A
shoot they've they've played terrible	2374	A
and uh so now it'd be really to their benefit to to really play uh some bad ball and and hopefully get a lucky uh lottery pick	2374	A
because_1 uh	2374	A
there's no way they can even- i think mathematically they're out of the play-off scene now	2374	A
so you know they they need to just play for a play-off pick	2374	A
or a	2374	A
you know the Suns are are pretty good	2374	A
they're uh	2374	A
yeah and they did- they made some trades uh	2374	A
oh they had one white guy i can't think of his name that was real good	2374	A
white uh Chambers yeah and uh	2374	A
you know if if they could get somebody to help compliment him you know i think they'd be uh awesome because_1 that guy can play	2374	A
that Chambers is is something else	2374	A
but uh	2374	A
i don't know it'll it'll be interesting	2374	A
i i really don't follow the pros that close either they they just play so many games that uh you know it's just hard to keep up with them	2374	A
but college- i really enjoy college basketball	2374	A
the most	2374	A
no they sure didn't sure didn't	2374	A
oh okay so you keep up with the	2374	A
uh	2374	A
yeah	2374	A
more of a football powerhouse i guess	2374	A
more of a football powerhouse up there i guess	2374	A
is basketball pretty big	2374	A
do what	2374	A
i	2374	A
that's- that's true that is right	2374	A
yeah so that's a tough conference	2374	A
huh	2374	A
yeah because_1 Ohio State used to be just a perennial powerhouse	2374	A
but uh	2374	A
and Michigan too but uh well i tell you what i appreciate uh the conversation	2374	A
and uh we'll have to we'll have to see how Phoenix ends up	2374	A
you too bye-bye	2374	A

i've had i've had that meal in New York uh where they bring you a plank sort of with all this wonderful beef parts of beef cooked and barbecued and it's marvelous uh i have	2304	A
i have to find a place around here that has that	2304	A
okay i'll keep that in mind yeah you serve that yourself or the for a family	2304	A
you ever serve that yourself when you have company	2304	A
uh-huh	2304	A
yeah	2304	A
oh that	2304	A
do you buy them um separately at you know an American grocery store now or do you have to or you don't you don't go buy it from a a wholesaler	2304	A
little butcher shops yeah	2304	A
yeah i've- i've lived in Mexico so i know	2304	A
yeah yeah	2304	A
yeah you have to you have poultry place what do you what other what dishes do you serve with it	2304	A
yeah i the turnover the stuffed turnovers oh i love those uh-huh	2304	A
yeah	2304	A
uh-huh	2304	A
do you remember when you were in Washington Sam the Argentine baker	2304	A
it used to be in Georgetown years ago he moved i guess he he retired and went back to Argentina i guess in nineteen- the early seventies	2304	A
yes so that must- that's before your time your parents might remember if they were here then	2304	A
okay i mean he was wonderful i we used to get the most marvelous empenadas and other Argentine things	2304	A
yeah i'm Italian	2304	A
uh-huh	2304	A
yeah well because there're many Italians in Argentina	2304	A
um-hum	2304	A
uh-huh yeah	2304	A
my grandparents my grandfather came to the United States through Argentina this was around the turn of the century	2304	A
actually actually a little bit later like nineteen- uh nineteen thirteen nineteen twelve nineteen thirteen	2304	A
yeah well i'll tell you it's interesting because when we cook here i'm of Italian descent my husband is Chinese	2304	A
so we and we both love European- Continental cooking French cooking so we cook uh our meals are well we don't do- we don't usually mix i mean that's well sometimes well if we're entertaining we'll do a Chinese recipe	2304	A
and um there are really easy recipe that is you know with Chinese you always have several dishes	2304	A
and nowadays with microwaves you can steam many of the things in a microwave i don't know if you have one	2304	A
and if you like Chinese food you can take filet of fish and put a little bit of soy sauce and a little bit of sesame oil on top of it	2304	A
and chop some scallions and a little ginger	2304	A
and just cover it with some uh waxed paper and steam it just until the fish is done and it's a wonderful	2304	A
um flavorful piece of fish yeah	2304	A
um-hum	2304	A
um-hum	2304	A
yeah buy a fresh filet of fish a nice one at the fish market- uh the fish counter	2304	A
um uh any white fish sole is good um um flounder sole or flounder is real good	2304	A
and even grouper	2304	A
little bit of soy sauce and sesame- sesame seed oil	2304	A
and not too much soy sauce uh some chopped up scallions- um you know slivers of scallions	2304	A
and slivers of ginger and then just cover it and put it in the microwave for just	2304	A
just two say two minutes check it after two minutes to see if the fish flakes and if the fish flakes it's done don't overcook it though	2304	A
yeah well till you just check it you know during and another quick dish if you like um if do you know what hoi sin sauce is it's that sweet Chinese sauce	2304	A
well if you go in a Chinese store ask for hoi sin H O I S I N	2304	A
H O I	2304	A
S I N or S E N either way they'll spell it hoi sin sauce it's a very sweet dark sort of a purplish plum sauce purplish brown	2304	A
and if you take uh little pieces of pork and you fry them like little cubes of pork	2304	A
and you fry them with garlic and a little bit of couple dashes of hot pepper	2304	A
and then mix some hoi sin sauce with sherry	2304	A
just a little sherry to thin it and stir that in you can even put a spoon of ketchup in and that makes a great pork dish with a sort of a spicy sweet sauce	2304	A
that you can serve over rice	2304	A
um well for two people um American- uh if it's American style i'd buy a half a pound if you know we if you're just serving that but if you're serving another dish with it say the rice dish	2304	A
um well with guys pretty healthy appetite i'd probably go a third of a pound and then you know you could	2304	A
and you can always you can always heat it up again and save you know	2304	A
yeah you can also do the same thing using um if you have ground beef just stir fry the ground beef drain off the oil use the same hoi sin sauce and um some of the frozen mixed vegetables	2304	A
just stir that in and you've got a very colorful side another dish	2304	A
um the hoi sin sauce oh a dollar twenty nine a can a can would serve would serve you for you know for quite a few um meals	2304	A
you know	2304	A
oh no no no no no it's not it's not expensive at all it's one- it's one of the Chinese cooking basics	2304	A
yeah well listen it was good talking with you	2304	A
hope you enjoy your recipe	2304	A

yeah they are if uh kind of depends on what you're looking for mine's just a one bedroom place that's uh	2368	A
uh it's hard for me to tell because i haven't rented in uh probably twenty twenty five years	2368	A
and uh just i'm getting back into apartment life	2368	A
and it's	2368	A
yeah but	2368	A
well they vary from from place to place it's hard to tell you know how well they've been kept up how old they are and these are probably oh one of the nicest that i found and uh	2368	A
they're almost five hundred a month for a one bedroom place	2368	A
yeah it does considering that you know you uh house payments are not a whole lot more than that	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
wow that's a lot for a townhouse	2368	A
but that's what happens when you get up in this area you know you got all these companies are up here and these they i guess they know they're going to get it	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
yeah that's true you just take off your mortgage interest and that's about it	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
oh yeah i've owned uh several and built several uh	2368	A
well well and especially around North Dallas or at least in Plano area they basically all look alike because_1 Fox and Jacobs and	2368	A
isn't it i can remember i've only been here eight years but i can remember coming to work from i used to live in Wylie and i could see downtown Dallas	2368	A
and now there's this brown haze over it and it's moving north	2368	A
oh yeah	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
yeah it does how- how long have you been in this house	2368	A
ten years	2368	A
no you really don't were you said you were out of state for a while was that a smaller town than than Dallas area	2368	A
how were the how were the house prices up there	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
wow	2368	A
hum	2368	A
oh yeah	2368	A
well you know a lot of these people that i've talked to that are coming down from uh like what i call the back East especially from JC Penney	2368	A
uh are selling two and three hundred thousand dollar houses up there and buying a hundred and fifty hundred and seventy five thousand dollar houses down here	2368	A
and they've wind up getting better houses here than they had there	2368	A
so in a way i guess it works both ways you know	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
that's a fact	2368	A
i guess that's true and they don't have to worry about yard upkeep because_1 they don't hardly have any	2368	A
that's true there's not too many basements in Texas	2368	A
yeah gosh i remember when i was little uh we didn't have a i lived grew up in southern Oklahoma and uh people across the street had a cellar and we- we never did	2368	A
and it's just like Dallas area it was tornado alley up there and every spring mom would drag me up at three o'clock four o'clock in the morning and pajamas and teddy bear across the street and we'd go into the cellar and i	2368	A
to this day i don't care if i go or not you know if it's going to get me it's get me	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
you ever thought about building a house	2368	A
you ever thought about building a house	2368	A
yeah that's true especially well well TI is like anybody else you never know how long you're going to be here or be in one place you know	2368	A
yeah do you work	2368	A
do you work	2368	A
so how do you handle do you got any kids	2368	A
so you got he's working and you're working and you got this big house to take care of how do you manage both of those	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
you basically can take care of everything yourself	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
what about home repairs and stuff do you have to do all that yourself or	2368	A
wow you too	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
oh yeah	2368	A
yeah sounds like you you've already got the makings for being a general contractor	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
if you don't wall paper it well together you should probably not build a house together	2368	A
yeah i built three houses in my life and	2368	A
oh they the the building process was a lot of fun but puts a lot of strain on things	2368	A
yeah-	2368	A
you bet	2368	A
oh you bet	2368	A
oh yeah	2368	A
well to some of them i guess it doesn't matter you know that maybe they've got enough coming in to to take care of it but	2368	A
hum	2368	A
um-hum	2368	A
oh yeah they as far as they're concerned they've come to the promised land you know they've got it made already	2368	A
oh yeah because you're combine uh confined by space you know i had a i came out of a thirty one hundred square foot two story house- house and i had room for everything	2368	A
in fact i had more room than i knew what to do with i don't know it's it's seems like room uh stuff always expands to fill available- available space but	2368	A
uh	2368	A
yeah you can yeah you know you learn- you adjust you figure out	2368	A
it's not as bad as i thought it was	2368	A
uh it's not as bad as i remembered especially going to college and living in apartments there you know how noisy that can be	2368	A
uh there seems to be a a more a mature crowd in uh apartments at least where i am uh even though you know there's kids all around and there's there's traffic and there's people going up and down the sidewalks and stuff like that but still uh	2368	A
yeah pretty much and uh there's never really any any oh i remember in school there's just seem like there was a fight or a party or something going on every night you don't run into that up here i think i think because there's so many uh professional people if you want to call them_1 that	2368	A
uh that go spend all day at work and they want to come home and they want some quiet	2368	A
yeah yeah you see a lot of activity outside people riding bikes or playing ball or jogging or doing this and that	2368	A
and uh they're trying to to unwind	2368	A
oh yeah it's a hundred and what eighty thousand something like that	2368	A
yeah	2368	A
oh yeah	2368	A
oh you bet and the thing that that gets me is uh you never really catch up you never really finish doing things and uh	2368	A
you're always paying for something you know	2368	A
um-hum	2368	A
oh you are constantly there's always something going wrong	2368	A
uh we live in a one story just like a ranch style home you know the the standard Texas uh Fox and Jacobs	2368	B
how about_1 you guys	2368	B
are you in a house- apartment or a house	2368	B
well they say that those are easy to find- or difficult to find	2368	B
how are rents doing i haven't looked at rents in a long time	2368	B
uh-huh	2368	B
what's a what's a one bedroom are you in a um well Plano most most complexes in Plano are pretty nice so you're probably in a you know	2368	B
um-hum	2368	B
ooh that does get high yeah i mean	2368	B
yeah i was going to say our mortgage is is between depending on you know it it drops um seems like in the last six months we um got lucky and we refinanced and it but it was like eight hundred and something but it went down to like seven hundred and twenty	2368	B
so that's really not i have friends that pay about nine hundred dollars for a townhouse in yeah in actually they're near Plano in North Dallas too but i couldn't believe it but you know	2368	B
yeah	2368	B
and then i think that um nobody was really buying homes for a long time there because of just i mean we've been in ours for about ten years but uh there's no investment in it you know	2368	B
all it allows you to do is itemize	2368	B
on your	2368	B
on your taxes yeah that's really about it it's uh have you ever owned your own home	2368	B
yeah suburban track yeah	2368	B
we uh we lived out of state for a while and came back and uh we lived in a smaller city and now we say gee Dallas really is big and polluted	2368	B
uh-huh	2368	B
yeah it's really it's really sad because they're they're not doing anything well we're getting off the subject i guess but just like with housing i mean they're not doing anything about pollution they're not doing anything about it's going to look like Houston- have you ever been to Houston	2368	B
you know um i used to think Dallas was better than Houston because_1 their zoning for where you can put a house next to a now it looks just like Houston to me you know	2368	B
we've been in here ten years	2368	B
yeah so we've got you know we've got some investment in it but you really don't get anything out of it	2368	B
yeah smaller we were up in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania	2368	B
my home town um the prices	2368	B
actually a lot better because_1 Pittsburgh is about the size i'm trying to think like a Louisville or Minneapolis that type of size	2368	B
and the prices what you get here for about a hundred thousand you could get there for about seventy five eighty	2368	B
um	2368	B
yeah Saint Louis whatever	2368	B
really	2368	B
i guess it's yeah but and here i guess it depends on what you want you know here once people like i know a lot of people that work for JC Penney in marketing	2368	B
and a lot of the people that came from that area probably like what you're talking about they had no um they had a lot of property but not a lot of house and now they have a lot of house and hardly any yardage around it	2368	B
but but they love it i mean they they they think that they're getting you know you say um sun room to them and you enclose and you can sell	2368	B
yeah	2368	B
yeah and a lot of them i know a couple women that work there and they don't miss in public relations and they don't miss having a basement to run up and down to you know	2368	B
and i said you haven't heard about tornados how about_1 bugs you know	2368	B
uh-huh	2368	B
yep	2368	B
that's exactly uh growing i grew up in western Pennsylvania near Pittsburgh and uh we used to call the basements actual cellars so it's funny to hear that word because_1 i never hear it you know it's like the back porch used to be a stoop you know	2368	B
but uh um the housing is just we like the older homes and i don't know if we're going to stay here or not depends you know i mean	2368	B
pardon me	2368	B
yeah actually when we were up north um but some family things changed so we ended up coming back down here and all that because it helped my husband's work but um	2368	B
we really would like to but we don't know if we're going to do it unless we stay here you know it	2368	B
yeah it it's real tough i mean the economy any more i mean i think everybody just lives under an umbrella the uncertainty with housing and everything you know it's um pardon me	2368	B
yes i do	2368	B
uh no we don't	2368	B
uh how do i take care of the house well i don't have a Mexican- i don't i shouldn't say that i don't have an ethnic maid i don't have we have some friends that live near North Dallas off of Campbell Road and they have like a four thousand square foot home and she's got a uh	2368	B
a live out nanny um but any rate i don't have any of that um i don't know it's really not too difficult with no children and just two people you know	2368	B
we have a	2368	B
yeah we have a dog and we're pretty i mean we're not fanatically neat but um we keep things up you know it's not like where there's three feet of weeds or anything in the yard by the time you need to um get around to fertilizing and cutting in the spring	2368	B
um no we're pretty much um we we've been around long enough as a couple that we learned a long time ago not to wallpaper together	2368	B
and things like that um we pretty much hire we subcontract mostly everything i mean other than anything that's not a um i mean i know how to fix a running toilet	2368	B
he does what he needs to but mostly if it's something major um you know cleaning out the air conditioning ducts or something like that we just hire out to do that	2368	B
yeah no thanks i	2368	B
have you ever done that i mean you sound like you may have been a couple one time	2368	B
and how'd that go	2368	B
uh-huh	2368	B
getting to agree to things that i'm sure and i also think that once you get to be um you know certain when you get to be thirty something and thirty something gets to be a little bit older	2368	B
you start um the dollar value on things	2368	B
i you know i think people that own homes a lot in North Dallas are very materialistic	2368	B
i know i'm supposed to talk about homes but people that own- the people that own them are the home homes themselves and you know um spending sixteen dollars a yard for custom draperies for custom drapes just doesn't	2368	B
yeah that's	2368	B
i mean and and you know you see a lot of these people that came east from uh west from uh from New York with Exxon or JC Penney and it's just a hoot to watch them	2368	B
right right exactly so well was it hard to adjust living in an apartment after being in a house	2368	B
oh my goodness yeah	2368	B
uh-huh	2368	B
yeah	2368	B
well in a way you can travel light	2368	B
how is how is apartment dwelling living in terms of general privacy and noise and things like that	2368	B
uh-huh	2368	B
yes i do	2368	B
everybody pretty much keep- keeps keeps to their own turf so to speak	2368	B
yeah	2368	B
uh-huh	2368	B
yeah relax and try to go to sleep really yeah	2368	B
and i think Plano in general is getting a little more well it's gotten so big it's almost a town in it's own right	2368	B
isn't that something yeah the price of home now we paid	2368	B
oh we paid um about seventy eight nine for our house like i said about a decade ago not even about nine years ago and	2368	B
i'd say they appraised it it's gone up you now maybe like five percent	2368	B
so it's an investment but it's something that you know when you're first married or starting out you think if you really have something but you really it's just real nowadays with the way income tax i think housing is strictly to itemize	2368	B
yeah exactly we	2368	B
yeah and even you know i mean like we had i called them prefabs just a track home you know i mean we we had one of their homes that was nicer in Pennsylvania but um it was an older home but then you buy an older home and you're always fixing things up	2368	B
so you know	2368	B
uh my favorite i watch the most is LA Law it seems to be you know it's on the evening time when i have more time to watch TV and i watch that one and	2356	B
uh-huh	2356	B
uh-huh	2356	B
what are those	2356	B
uh-huh	2356	B
i've never seen that one	2356	B
yeah i know what it's about i've just never seen you know saw it	2356	B

uh-huh	2356	B
uh-huh	2356	B
yeah that one's a funny one	2356	B
one show i can't stand is Married With Children	2356	B
it's on i believe it's on Sundays or something	2356	B
yeah and it's kind of disgusting	2356	B
oh i know and then they're always grinding you know it's just not	2356	B
yeah	2356	B
i don't care for those two but no i like LA Law it you know it seems like it i guess because it continues on each time and it keeps you interested	2356	B
yeah almost about it's about what it seems to be like so	2356	B
yeah it could be i don't know that the character- you know the people that that much so	2356	B
yeah	2356	B
uh-huh	2356	B
uh-huh	2356	B

what-	2356	A
well we have it you know we're out here in Dennison we had to get cable because of uh we only got two channels you know and channel twelve's down here with us and it just	2356	A

uh i know we're we're constantly sitting in front of TV i don't work	2356	A
and uh the way the weather was lately we've sat in front of the TV and watch- uh most of the time since we got cable we stick with Nickelodeon	2356	A
uh until the cartoons goes off and then we flip it over to uh General Hospital for an hour	2356	A
and uh that's the only soap i watch anymore	2356	A
uh	2356	A
well uh my daughter likes Sesame Street she's two and she- she will sit down and watch Sesame Street but we've got Bambi on video and uh	2356	A

yeah it was nice talking to you	2356	A
oh how where have you gotten them_1 from	2356	A
i've gotten one guy from San Francisco	2356	A
well it was kind of funny	2356	A
yeah okay well you take it easy	2356	A
all right bye-bye	2356	A
are you a player	2331	A
is it	2331	A
um	2331	A
yeah	2331	A
yeah i haven't- i haven't played in about two years and then i went out two weeks ago with the guys here i work at TI and i played in a tournament out there and i shot a net fifty nine they were kind of little upset	2331	A
but i guess i laid off long enough to get rid of all my bad habits	2331	A
i have a hard time inventing shots you know let's go around this tree and you know try a slice through a hook here and i can't do that so i i finally got out and i've been watching quite a few videos i	2331	A
hadn't been able to play so i took out a few videos and watched them for a while and i	2331	A
i hope i'm on the right track you know i shot a career low eighty nine so and my handicap's twenty i-	2331	A
i like the	2331	A
really	2331	A
yeah i've tried to get my wife i bought her a set of clubs four years ago she hasn't even swung them but she wants to get into it now after i came home and won the tournament the other day she's	2331	A
she's ready to get off into it but you know i like i just like getting out being in the outdoors and i'm a hunter and a fisher anyway but you know i- you know at least i can get out and play a few hours of golf and	2331	A
it's not going to cost me an arm and a leg really	2331	A
and i you know i walk i don't ride so you know i get a little exercise there too so	2331	A
yeah	2331	A
right	2331	A
yeah	2331	A
oh	2331	A
yeah	2331	A
yeah it's pretty nice we played out here a couple of times in the middle of the winter when my parents came down and what not they were amazed	2331	A
you know here it is sixty five degrees we're out playing golf and they're freezing cold back there so	2331	A
but i uh picked it up when i was in high school at on the same as a PE course and then when i got into the service i got into it	2331	A
and then when i come out here i just kind of let it go and then one of one of the guys mentioned to me at work one day if i played golf i said well yeah you know i've got my clubs but i haven't swung them_1 in quite a few years	2331	A
and then i got into it and then back out of it and it it just seems like every couple of years i get back in there	2331	A
you know i really enjoy it it's really nice	2331	A
yeah	2331	A
yeah you don't want to go out and get beat to death but	2331	A
no	2331	A
and then you know we've got some guys here they're you know four and five handicappers and they don't like to play with me because_1 i'm too slow for them_1 so	2331	A
you know but get somebody around your own handicap and you can just mosey on out for three or four hours and have a good time	2331	A
and i've you know i've never never yet have i walked up now i've walked up a few times on the golf course by myself with nobody else to play with and never yet have i met anybody on the golf course that wouldn't allow me to join their	2331	A
twosome or threesome you know they're always friendly sure come on out you know and they don't mind if you make a mistake they don't mind saying well you know let me teach- tell you how to do that or teach you how to do that or	2331	A
you know it's it's pretty nice and friendly out there and you can't find that in all sports	2331	A
right	2331	A
yeah	2331	A
yeah you need to	2331	A
yeah	2331	A
oh yeah we we have one down here in the summertime uh it runs from like five o'clock to seven thirty or eight o'clock you know because_1 it doesn't get dark -until nine thirty or ten	2331	A
and we play in the summertime out here we get a mixed league in and that's what i'm trying to get her ready for it's going to start well when we we change the time back whenever that is next month i guess	2331	A
and it'll start then and you know we had a lot of girls out there a couple of years ago and they were just starting to learn and you know they were shooting a hundred a hundred and twenty but they were	2331	A
you know now they're down into the hundreds nineties so it won't take her long	2331	A
you know	2331	A
and it's something we can do together so	2331	A
well she doesn't do much hunting she could care less about that she does a little fishing but you know golf would give her the exercise she'd be outside give her something to do that we both enjoy so	2331	A
yeah	2331	A
um-hum	2331	A
yeah	2331	A
yeah	2331	A
all right	2331	A
yeah and it's you know it's a game that you don't like bowling you know you feel bad if you bowl a hundred but if you shoot a hundred in golf you know you don't have to be an expert to play any novice can pick up a club and learn how to hold one and learn how to do it and do it right	2331	A
so you know you don't have to be an expert in any aspect of it at all	2331	A
yeah	2331	A
yeah	2331	A
and when you know when i first got back into it i used to get mad because_1 i knew i could do something and i didn't get it done you know and i just well i need to slice this ball around here i naturally slice anyway	2331	A
now you know the ball'll go straight and i go i never broke a club or anything but you know i'd get upset about it sometimes and now i guess you know being in my forties i just kind of mellowed out a little bit i don't get upset any more so	2331	A
and	2331	A
well i enjoyed talking to you	2331	A
i guess i'll go back to work	2331	A
all right see you later bud bye-bye	2331	A
uh i'd like to think i am it's it's been a while now	2331	B
yeah i've uh	2331	B
oh just recently i got married and we bought a house we're about fifty yards from the golf course but unfortunately the house is taking up my time	2331	B
so it's been uh it's been almost a year i guess since i've actually uh swung a club for a purpose	2331	B
yeah	2331	B
yeah yeah	2331	B
right	2331	B
right	2331	B
yeah	2331	B
that's that's great yeah	2331	B
no it's uh i could say it's been a while for me too i uh i've got my wife motivated about it um	2331	B
and uh i think that's probably going to be one of our next investments is get her get her a set of clubs and uh we'll get out of the driving range and and get some interest built up and hopefully we can uh we can start in	2331	B
really	2331	B
well great great that's good	2331	B
yeah same thing here	2331	B
right right	2331	B
um-hum yeah	2331	B
that's i've got the same attitude i uh	2331	B
i tell you i- i started i guess the first time i played golf has been probably about eight or ten years ago now when i was in college	2331	B
and uh i took uh took it as a PE course and then kind of left it alone for a while and then finally got got into it when i was while i was still in school and	2331	B
since then uh we've made it um as as the friends start getting married and things like that we've made a tradition of uh having a a Thursday	2331	B
or well have have probably like a like a Thursday night bachelor party and a Friday golf day before the wedding	2331	B
and uh so it that's back in South Dakota where i grew up and uh so that that's uh that's been my main my main involvement is it seems like i go home and play golf more than i do around here but uh	2331	B
eventually i get people to come and visit me in Dallas and then i'll show them_1 that we can play golf in the middle of winter when we can't do it back home	2331	B
yeah	2331	B
yep yep	2331	B
oh -okay	2331	B
yeah	2331	B
yeah that's right	2331	B
oh it is- it's it's a lot of fun especially- especially if you can find somebody that's uh that's got the same level of interest that that seems to be the hardest thing well about that's- that's that's true of any sport you know if you want to play tennis or	2331	B
racquetball	2331	B
right and and people don't want to play with somebody that they're going to beat every time you know and and uh and	2331	B
um-hum	2331	B
right	2331	B
that's right yeah	2331	B
that's true	2331	B
that's true	2331	B
well	2331	B
that that that's uh	2331	B
yeah that's absolutely right and you can gain a lot of ground doing that too if you	2331	B
you- you know you you get stuck- you get in a rut if- if you do play a lot but you play with the same people you you aren't going to learn anything uh after after a short period once you learn everything they've got to offer then uh	2331	B
you know you've basically tapped your resources there	2331	B
but uh i'd i'd like to uh eventually i'd like to work- work up if if my wife does get interested and and maybe get involved in a league in a in a mixed mixed doubles league or something like that	2331	B
um-hum	2331	B
right	2331	B
uh-huh	2331	B
sure	2331	B
right	2331	B
well that's good that's good that sounds like a lot of fun	2331	B
yeah	2331	B
yeah it it sounds like we've got real similar situations uh i i go home uh i've gone home every year now since i've moved to Dallas to to go pheasant hunting and uh	2331	B
um the the last time i i took my wife along and uh kind- kind of the same situation she sat- she sat in the house and talked to my mother the whole time we were out hunting and stuff but	2331	B
she'll definitely uh she'll make the trip for fishing if we if that comes along but uh	2331	B
it's uh that's interesting though	2331	B
um-hum	2331	B
that's right	2331	B
um-hum	2331	B
that's right well yeah that's i've i've kind of formed the attitude that you know if- if i could just if i could pick two or three shots out uh	2331	B
out of my game every time and put them_1 together on one hole then i do pretty good and then and	2331	B
i keep i keep rationalizing well you know i i can do it i i just got to do it all at the on the same hole and and then it'll get better and you just keep going and in the meantime just enjoy what you're doing and	2331	B
it it it really works that way	2331	B
um-hum	2331	B
yeah	2331	B
yeah	2331	B
sure	2331	B
sure	2331	B
yeah that's great	2331	B
well you bet	2331	B
okay sounds like it	2331	B
okay bye	2331	B
oh i'm definitely a player i guess uh there is some question about that when i total up the score but	2388	B
oh i like to uh think putting is probably my uh	2388	B
forte	2388	B
i guess i have the most trouble with chipping how about_1 you	2388	B
yeah i used to have a lot of trouble with that with a wicked slice and so forth but i think i've overcome a good deal of that	2388	B
yeah	2388	B
i've always threatened to take lessons but i've never gotten around to it	2388	B
oh really	2388	B
built that confidence right up there huh	2388	B
that can be bad i mean you know they a lot of people say	2388	B
i think that's mine	2388	B
let me just quick catch it and i'll be back	2388	B
i'm back	2388	B
yeah uh	2388	B
they uh	2388	B
my uh i have an interesting anecdote	2388	B
my uh my uh son who goes up to A&M he's uh had the pleasure of having a hole in one	2388	B
yeah	2388	B
oh thank God i've never been to Midland	2388	B
yeah	2388	B
well one of my uh well control	2388	B
and uh and contact are a big problem and they still are but	2388	B
this one of the things i was doing wrong was too much back swing and hurrying my back swing	2388	B
yeah	2388	B
that sounds like the exact same words my friend tells me	2388	B
yeah	2388	B
yeah	2388	B
well you have to prove it to yourself just by doing it a few times	2388	B
it's a frustrating game golf	2388	B
it's getting more expensive unfortunately too	2388	B
like you i haven't played any or not much this year i played couple of times but	2388	B
i went out skiing in February and uh took uh little tumble down the slopes and uh so i'm nursing a wounded wing right	2388	B
yeah	2388	B
yeah well i love the game so uh i enjoyed talking about it	2388	B
okay enjoyed it	2388	B
bye-bye	2388	B
okay well uh so what do you think about golfing are you a spectator or a player	2388	A
yeah i know how you feel about that that's true	2388	A
what's what's uh what's the best part of your game do you think	2388	A
um-hum	2388	A
what is your worst then	2388	A
well i think i think my best part actually is chipping or at least it was last year i haven't been out this year it's kind of been uh kind of strange i hadn't been able to get out yet but uh my biggest problem is staying in the fairway	2388	A
for you know with drives and stuff um	2388	A
um-hum	2388	A
yeah i've i've gone in the past years from uh having a wicked slice to having a wicked hook to back to having a wicked slice i mean it's just uh	2388	A
and i can't seem to find the middle space you know but i've i've got a friend of mine working on it uh i've trying to help me out i've been going to the driving range with him and and it seems to be doing some um	2388	A
yeah well lessons are are okay if you do it right i think i did i took some lessons uh a couple of years back but to tell you the truth that for a while hurt more than it helped um because i i and it turned out that i couldn't do anything right after that	2388	A
um	2388	A
even you know like i said my chipping which is one of the best things in my game i couldn't do that i couldn't couldn't drive couldn't you know in in fact it was it wasn't as much at that point that i was hooking and slicing i just i was topping the ball i was	2388	A
you know i was doing a lot of things wrong at that point but i was trying to think of so many different things at the same time because_1 you know it was	2388	A
it it's kind of a funny story whenever i went for- for my first lesson	2388	A
the uh the instructor takes me out there and he says all right well take a swing and let me see how you look so he's he's bending down on one knee right so i take a swing and and all of a sudden his head just goes down	2388	A
and and then all of a you know he just kind of slowly brings his head up and looks at me and he says we've got a lot of work to do so	2388	A
oh yeah i was feeling real good then so so he broke me down from i mean he started me from the very beginning as far as changing just about everything i did and uh	2388	A
uh	2388	A
well that's like i said	2388	A
oh yeah	2388	A
ah oh that's definitely true in fact if uh if i ever you know have a son or anything i'm definitely going to uh you know teaching have a have a lesson or something is that yours or mine	2388	A
all right	2388	A
okay	2388	A
what's that	2388	A
oh yeah	2388	A
well uh you know the only person i've ever known that had a hole in one was my brother-in-law but uh and he he said he got his luckily so i don't know that's that's but i mean	2388	A
i came so close once just once i mean that's the only time i've ever been any anywhere near but i mean i was uh i used to live out in Midland Texas i don't know if you've ever been out there but it's you know a real windy place	2388	A
but uh	2388	A
yeah i- i played on a course out there and like i said it's a very windy place so it's you know the wind was blowing and it was cold and it was like it was about a hundred and i don't know a hundred and seventy or a hundred and eighty year par three	2388	A
and i you know the wind was right in my face so i just pulled out a seven wood right and i put that thing i mean it rolled right by the cup and only ended up three inches off but you know over over past the hole but i mean that's as close as i've ever been you know	2388	A
because_1 i'm not you know that's one of my problems is uh is controlling my my uh my irons on a par three so i have a lot of trouble hitting the greens	2388	A
so do you do you like watching it though i mean	2388	A
yeah well that's that's exactly what my friend has has figured out that i do is my i can actually see the club on my backswing and and uh	2388	A
and he says that what i do is i'm actually crossing the plain is what this is his words his technical words for it crossing yeah	2388	A
yeah because_1 it- because_1 i ended up into an inverted C where the uh the weight was on the wrong foot or something so	2388	A
i i've found that i actually do of uh i get a lot uh better control and distance if i don't you know don't take as big a back swing	2388	A
yeah what's funny is the idea that uh you know what i consider you know like a three-quarter backswing or even a half backswing	2388	A
uh my friend says that's you know that's a full backswing and you don't want to go any further than that so i mean it's a now it's a matter of trying to convince myself that that's right	2388	A
so i don't know it's going to be interesting	2388	A
um that's probably true	2388	A
well	2388	A
oh isn't it though i don't know why i do it	2388	A
oh that's that's one of the worse things about it it really is but uh	2388	A
you know	2388	A
um-hum	2388	A
you know that's it you have to be healthy too that's another point i guess	2388	A
well i think that's about it	2388	A
yeah i do too	2388	A
yeah	2388	A
well you take care all right yeah good luck	2388	A
bye	2388	A
that's true	2361	B
and you get sequestered or something then you're there for months	2361	B
when- when you get sequestered and you're there for months	2361	B
true	2361	B
yeah	2361	B
yeah right	2361	B
well as as you say the the um	2361	B
benefits are the biggest part of it i think that today with costs uh for medical insurance and eyeglasses and dental and all that	2361	B
it is a boom- a a a plus to have that even- as far as your uh salary goes you know along with it	2361	B
because_1 it's not out of pocket money and it they also have good insurance- uh life insurance policies good retirement Dakota the um jet funds all that stuff i think you know the IRA's	2361	B
uh the profit sharing the stock options	2361	B
there are a they offer a lot of ways for you to save money too if you have any extra you know that like the uh code over the two for one type of thing or they match half i guess it is	2361	B
and um	2361	B
i think that uh a a lot of it's the personal recognition that the company gives people if they do a good job	2361	B
uh the incentive you know to want to do a good job	2361	B
and the um	2361	B
MIR awards banquets and things i think they do a lot as far as trying to motivate people	2361	B
and they're uh meetings	2361	B
to keep you full informed	2361	B
you don't find that much in small companies because_1 you can kind of interface but when you get a big company like ours i think it's great that they take the time to you know give us a monthly meeting to tell us what's going on	2361	B
that type of thing um	2361	B
uh	2361	B
we interface kind of like uh on the tip teams and things i think that's a good deal	2361	B
it gives you a chance to feel like you're a part of a group or the organization and that you're heard	2361	B
and know and if you have ideas that type of thing	2361	B
oh i use it up	2361	B
do you have a mandatory	2361	B
uh do you have a mandatory shut down	2361	B
oh that's why see see you can you're able to do that but we haven't got much choice	2361	B
that's the if i had to say one thing negative that would be it because i feel like you know you earn your vacation time and you should be able to take it when you want to	2361	B
but we're not allowed to we have to take two weeks when the company shuts down you know	2361	B
and i can understand it from there point of view in on the one hand because they have to you know consider the customers that they're supplying	2361	B
but it makes it very hard especially if a husband and wife work at Texas Instruments	2361	B
and one has vacation one time and one has vacation another time you know you're not in the same area	2361	B
so you have to take a two week shut down and it's not at the same time	2361	B
so that isn't too nice	2361	B
uh this year they were going to try to do something different about that too they were going to try to schedule the whole site to go down at the same time	2361	B
to eliminate that and that you're talking about five thousand people	2361	B
so that's quite a feat in itself	2361	B
uh-huh	2361	B
uh-huh	2361	B
oh that's great	2361	B
yeah really that's excellent	2361	B
yeah yeah	2361	B
yeah	2361	B
yeah	2361	B
well they're doing a lot with um automation specialist also that's what i do	2361	B
uh where you have to go to school to or run the new automated- automated equipment it's all computerized and and stuff	2361	B
and uh there's a lot of job security in that because it takes so long to uh come up to an experience level where you're able to you know you have to be able to maintain them do the maintenance uh	2361	B
diagnose what's wrong with the machine and you know do whatever it takes to get it started again and things	2361	B
and interface with the technicians in the toolroom	2361	B
so you're kind of like your own boss as far as the machinery goes	2361	B
and um it's about a two year to three year experience before you're able to really um i would say payback	2361	B
you know and and do the job well	2361	B
and you're still learning even after all that time because_1 they're very complex machines	2361	B
exactly that's right	2361	B
yeah	2361	B
and they offer uh a lot of uh opportunity to go to school	2361	B
that's another good uh benefit that TI has and they'll pay for ninety percent of your schooling with no commitment to them	2361	B
you know like a lot of companies will send you to school but you have to sign a paper that you'll work for them for five years	2361	B
or uh you know to that affect	2361	B
and you're kind of locked in so that if a career move comes up where you could take advantage of it you can't if you're you know signed in a contract	2361	B
whereas at TI they don't do that	2361	B
oh	2361	B
oh	2361	B
oh	2361	B
yeah	2361	B
well this part of the country there's no shortage- shortage of uh good schools	2361	B
you know like MIT and and uh Boston's only uh an hours drive from here	2361	B
so a lot of the the people can go you know to uh a good school	2361	B
and right in Rhode Island there are some nice colleges too Rhode Island college and	2361	B
well a large organization offers uh	2361	A
usually a good vacation time and they offer uh holidays and and	2361	A
medical and dental programs sometimes as well as just the ability to takeoff uh personal leave or whatever you need	2361	A
and one thing that i've found coming in handy lately is juror duty uh being paid for that or or at least a full days pay plus whatever the the local government pays you	2361	A
it's nice to be able to do that and not have to concern yourself with your job as it were especially if you get on a case	2361	A
so uh	2361	A
um-hum	2361	A
right that would be uh a	2361	A
uh flex times another benefit that i- i like that TI's been doing uh though officially they just started it uh	2361	A
uh relatively recently uh we were always given the privilege with our	2361	A
supervisor that was there we were really small shop and there was only one shift so we didn't interfere with anyone and	2361	A
he liked the idea of having someone there early enough to handle third shift's concerns and late enough to handle second shift and so he allowed us to come in basically as we as we wanted to and as it worked out two or three of us were there about six in the morning and	2361	A
and later on well eight to nine o'clock some other ones would show up and that puts people there at the five o'clock time frame and it really worked out well and then then of course they came long and sanctioned it and	2361	A
and actually made it a little worse in that they said they didn't want any of us starting before six thirty so	2361	A
they have to hang around a little later to get there third shift work in but uh	2361	A
it's it's nice to have flex time especially being able to take off in the middle of the day and uh not hurt your pay if you come back and finish your eight hours that's that's a real benefit	2361	A
what have you found that you like in a big organization	2361	A
um-hum	2361	A
um-hum	2361	A
right	2361	A
um-hum	2361	A
right	2361	A
do you	2361	A
right	2361	A
um-hum do you find that your vacation time do you manage to use it up or do you end up into the must use okay	2361	A
there's a number of us in our little group that end up having to take the must used five or six of us in fact uh just	2361	A
tend not to get around to taking it all at once and uh by the end of the year it kind sneaks up on us and i managed to carry forward the maximum amount there is and	2361	A
and uh i'm still doing uh my wife works uh half of a half of one day one day a week so on Thursdays	2361	A
excuse me	2361	A
no we don't have uh we do have mass vacation but in our group it doesn't apply we're so busy year round yeah	2361	A
right too	2361	A
take it when you want to yeah	2361	A
right	2361	A
right	2361	A
um-hum	2361	A
right	2361	A
oh boy	2361	A
yeah	2361	A
yeah it is	2361	A
we've got um if i take half a day off during the summertime when the kids are out of school i can manage to be home in time to uh take care of the kids before the wife leaves she works	2361	A
uh oh i starts about eleven or twelve o'clock uh at the dentist office and works until seven thirty or eight that's just one late night to it to clean teeth as it were and	2361	A
he had a hard time finding someone that was willing to work that that that seldom and in those hours and she didn't mind keeping her hand in the business while the kids were growing up as it were and	2361	A
she worked that day and then occasional Saturdays and uh with with the vacation time even if i takeoff the ten or twelve times a	2361	A
a Thursday during the summer i still don't eat up all my vacation and end up taking a full week somewhere else and then having a day or two left over on top of that so	2361	A
it's it's kind of nice to be able to do both and uh i'll probably be doing that for a few years now until the kids get old enough to stay by themselves	2361	A
so yeah it's nice to have these little little benefits that i know wouldn't uh wouldn't happen in a real small company several of my friends have left uh the Metroplex is just full of little companies and they've left TI to go to a little company and	2361	A
and ended up you know even though they started with some vacation time uh it just did they had to schedule it around when they could get away and	2361	A
and uh then they don't have quite the job security although you know now there's a lot of people getting cut but	2361	A
still but by and large the majority of people that are still there in even in the defense industry uh	2361	A
if the job has got something you know something worth doing as far as the contract goes if there is a contract then you're probably pretty secure on that contract	2361	A
and	2361	A
um-hum	2361	A
um-hum	2361	A
right	2361	A
right	2361	A
well that's good	2361	A
yeah it's good that you can	2361	A
pick up something that adds to both your your security and your knowledge base	2361	A
you're getting two things at once there	2361	A
well have	2361	A
um-hum	2361	A
right	2361	A
right	2361	A
um-hum	2361	A
um-hum	2361	A
yeah i've i've looked at several uh	2361	A
courses as it were the only problem that we have is things that are that are specifically on our job	2361	A
uh that the courses that apply to our job other than the real basics like just the math and the physics and the like	2361	A
uh all of them are taught at colleges that are very remote in other words there like there's one in Washington DC and there's one in Oregon	2361	A
and they're they're just a few in the country that even have this type of training but just keeping up on the basics i guess are things that we could continue to do but um	2361	A
well we have we have lots of	2361	A
right	2361	A
um-hum	2361	A
we have lots of uh schools they just only only one in the entire area offers a course in what's called	2361	A
well i primarily listen to classical music when i have my druthers partly because i find it more soothing i don't know a lot about classical music so far as uh any background in music but it's the the music i enjoy the most how about you	2387	B
right	2387	B
uh-huh	2387	B
i tend to listen to the classical music uh on the radio a lot there's uh one particular well there several stations in this area that play uh classical music all the time but there's one in particular that	2387	B
is on both AM and FM so i can listen to it without uh worrying it's cute though because my children when they get in the car and i have uh the button pushed for that they always switch it to something else	2387	B
because_1 naturally that isn't their taste	2387	B
at this point in time anyway	2387	B
are are you involved in music	2387	B
well my whole family uh is somewhat musical um and not from training but just because we sing in our choir and	2387	B
my daughter's quite involved and all that sort of thing so um i think that one of these days maybe she'll get involved in classical music too because that's usually what happens if you unless you get into rock which isn't her voice style so	2387	B
no i well most of it is not all that exciting in that it is terribly repetitious	2387	B
it's loud and repetitious without having a great deal of meaning now i do like folk song um and there have been some nice folk songs over the years that you know kind of still hang around	2387	B
but um but the more popular music i don't care for usually	2387	B
um even when i was a teenager i didn't really like the music of that period so much because i found i liked um a little bit more melodious music than what was often the popular	2387	B
rock and roll kind of thing	2387	B
although now i kind of enjoy hearing the rock and roll i guess it makes me think i'm young again	2387	B
isn't that the truth it's funny in fact it's interesting to me that so many of the songs now i grew up	2387	B
in the late fifties and early sixties and so much of the music that was popular at that time has come back	2387	B
and you you don't hear everything all the time but you hear much of the same music perhaps a new version of it but it's the same stuff	2387	B
um which is always kind of funny um and i remember my older sister i have a sister who's sixteen years older and at the time that i was	2387	B
a teenager late teenager i guess i can't remember the year Smoke Gets In Your Eyes became popular i think it was done by maybe the Platters or something	2387	B
then and she laughed and she said well you know when i was a teenager that had been you know some years before she said that was a a version of you know a song then and she said it's very similar but they've changed a little bit she said i like the original version better	2387	B
right right it does indeed	2387	B
uh-huh	2387	B
yes now that there there's some wonderful Christian music when you can find good stations uh the problem- problem that i found um in this area is that the	2387	B
there there is inconsistency in the quality	2387	B
here if you get someone who's very good at selecting it's okay but sometimes they kind of get on a a a binge and they they play the same sort of thing over and over again without really necessarily quality	2387	B
you know uh i live in the uh Washington DC area Rockville Maryland	2387	B
yeah and it	2387	B
uh-huh and i i you know there's so much available that i don't understand why they do that but um	2387	B
now my children have have sometimes um well they've gone to a few of the concerts and so on of Christian musicians that come for our youth group at our church and um and	2387	B
they- when they buy a tape or something sometimes that's fun because it's different and something i've not always heard and you know i enjoy that	2387	B
oh wow	2387	B
yeah that's nice so is your husband a singer	2387	B
right yeah	2387	B
well that's a good thing to do	2387	B
that's nice uh well do you have children	2387	B
well wonderful that'll be a musician	2387	B
oh there's some wonderful Christian uh children's tapes	2387	B
you can uh you can get and i know when my children were younger um we found a lot of really nice tapes that they that they liked um there was an Agape music group and um	2387	B
i some of the songs i still find going over in my head over and over again because they were really um	2387	B
very memorable even though my children are now my youngest is almost sixteen but i still find some of the same tapes i uh some of the same songs from those tapes i enjoy	2387	B
um there's one that's um a little girl singing Practice Makes Perfect	2387	B
and uh she's playing the piano and so she she gets the wrong note every now and then but then she keeps repeating it practice makes perfect and then you know talking about that so far as Christian life too and it's really cute	2387	B
yeah	2387	B
yeah right	2387	B
yeah well do you know something because i have always played classical music	2387	B
uh or classical style it's not always classical as you know the official uh word might go but um	2387	B
even when i was pregnant of course i listened to that and when our first child was you know an infant um of course i when i was around the house i played that music too	2387	B
when he first made sounds that you could detect they were in the scale the music scale	2387	B
someone else noticed it and i said well i guess that's true and it was somewhat melodious in other words it wasn't just you know it was really funny	2387	B
right right i do think there is probably an influence there because i noticed that even though popular music	2387	B
the the wilder stuff was around when my uh older children were were you know adolescents early adolescents when they first start listening to music on their own they first get ask for a radio of their own and so on um	2387	B
this same child um really listened to- to more um {ballady} or um	2387	B
pleasant sort of songs rather than and even classical rather than the uh real hard rock stuff that so many other kids listen to	2387	B
and i i never i didn't want to say too much for fear he would think it was wrong and wouldn't do it anymore	2387	B
right but uh but i must say they all kind of like a variety of music which is nice i like that	2387	B
yeah	2387	B
well it was nice talking to you and good luck with the baby	2387	B
bye-bye	2387	B
okay what types of music do you like to listen to	2387	A
i like classical music also i uh like you i don't know a whole lot about it and i i would like to buy more classical tapes and stuff but i'm not sure	2387	A
which composers or which it is that i really like so i kind of hesitate to buy something there are certain kinds i like and certain kinds i don't	2387	A
yeah	2387	A
yeah i understand that	2387	A
uh no not really My husband is but not i do uh the world a favor and i don't sing aloud to anybody but myself	2387	A
yeah i	2387	A
yeah i i don't care for rock at all i guess i'm real old fashioned	2387	A
in my musical tastes	2387	A
yes	2387	A
right	2387	A
yeah	2387	A
yeah i agree with that too	2387	A
yeah now rock and roll seems tame compared to like the New Age and all that stuff	2387	A
uh-huh	2387	A
right	2387	A
uh-huh	2387	A
crops up every so often i listen to um the Christian radio station when i'm in the car K L T Y	2387	A
and i like to listen to some of that music	2387	A
yeah	2387	A
uh-huh	2387	A
yeah where do you live	2387	A
ah i thought maybe you lived in Dallas because that's the complaint i make to my husband about the radio station too i said oh they're playing one of their ten songs it seems like every week they pick ten and they just play them over and over	2387	A
yeah	2387	A
yeah	2387	A
uh-huh	2387	A
right	2387	A
my husband likes uh Sandy Patty songs he likes to sing those in church he'd buy all the sound tracks he could get his hands on it if he had the money to	2387	A
well just an amateur singer He sings in the choir and he likes to do special music and stuff at church	2387	A
yeah yeah i like to hear him sing he does a good job	2387	A
no not yet we're expecting a baby in July	2387	A
i guess we'll start listening	2387	A
yeah maybe so we'll start listening to children's music	2387	A
yeah there are	2387	A
uh-huh	2387	A
oh uh	2387	A
uh-huh	2387	A
uh-huh	2387	A
oh	2387	A
that yeah that sounds really cute	2387	A
uh i tell my husband to sing to my stomach because they say that babies can hear quite a lot while they're still in the womb and i said then when when it's born you can hold it and sing that again and maybe it'll comfort her you know when she's fussy and stuff	2387	A
what	2387	A
uh-huh	2387	A
huh	2387	A
how strange	2387	A
uh-huh {babbly} i'll say that is well we'll have to keep up with that then	2387	A
uh-huh	2387	A
huh	2387	A
right yeah have something to rebel against	2387	A
yeah that's good yeah variety is good	2387	A
well i guess that covers it It was real good talking to you	2387	A
um well thanks um bye	2387	A
hi	2344	A
my name's Ken	2344	A
and um	2344	A
you're in Texas right	2344	A
everybody's in Texas God okay	2344	A
i'm in Rochester New York everybody else but one has been in Texas	2344	A
okay well i guess we should get on with this um did you get the message about what it was right yeah okay go great let me just hit the button	2344	A
okay um do you think that the Soviet Union represents a threat to us	2344	A
yeah that's interesting i don't i- i suspect they're not our biggest threat anymore	2344	A
i suspect it's probably some crazy man like Saddam Hussein	2344	A
who's our biggest threat but um i wonder if they're i wonder how much of a threat they are i agree with you that that they'll always be somewhat of a threat given that they have that there's just	2344	A
it's just so big and there's just so much military machine there	2344	A
right	2344	A
but i wonder how much longer they're going to be a them	2344	A
huh	2344	A
that's	2344	A
yeah uh	2344	A
yeah oh i agree i mean if we were to if if something were to happen i'm sure they would all of a sudden band together just for the sake of	2344	A
for the sake of uh of of unity against us or something if if if need be but	2344	A
yeah actually i noticed that i mean this- this- this this most recent scam of his where he said	2344	A
where where he just decided that instead of having uh	2344	A
instead of having	2344	A
i can't- i can't think of the word now um	2344	A
if they're having demonstrations for in in favor of Boris Yeltsin he decided well i'll just cancel all demonstrations altogether	2344	A
so i- i- i think that he he he's actually he i think is becoming very dangerous	2344	A
because he's making those people angry at him and he's also i think he's also making	2344	A
um the military angry at him i mean i've heard stories now where the	2344	A
where the um the military is running around and they're sort of getting restless	2344	A
and a restless military is the kind of thing that happens you know with with the Baltic States when they just go in there	2344	A
to beat people up	2344	A
um-hum	2344	A
that's interesting	2344	A
i- i wonder i don't know if he's he he seems	2344	A
the thing about Gorbachev strikes me that he wouldn't be that dumb i don't know though	2344	A
that's that that's that's something that really true that may sort of that military thing i was speaking of before i think that's that's certainly true i mean his military may just go out and say well we just Gorbachev said you can't do it and we're just not going to let you do it you know so	2344	A
yeah that that's real scary actually i mean i- i would suspect their own problems would keep them away from us for awhile but	2344	A
it could be real dangerous	2344	A
yeah right we don't need to worry about them	2344	A
yes but wouldn't it be nice if no one had to fight anybody else	2344	A
yes	2344	A
well i don't i don't know i think that underlying- underlying- underlying we're all pretty	2344	A
probably not as as different as everybody thinks	2344	A
right well that's that's certainly true i just	2344	A
that's true i was i was discussing with someone before um this uh someone before actually one of these calls	2344	A
as a matter of fact about um	2344	A
another topic but it came up under these um	2344	A
this this this poem Everything I Wanted to Know I Learned in Kindergarten or something	2344	A
you've read that one before	2344	A
that this this is the idea that i think is actually very is is what i think we should all revert to	2344	A
the idea that um basically they said you know everything happened in kindergarten and and in kindergarten we learned to share	2344	A
and we learned to um play with each other we learned to take nap you know and to take naps and and whenever we'd start a fight we'd all apologize and hug each other	2344	A
you know and and that would be all and if we could just do the same thing	2344	A
sort of with with with everybody else i suspect we'd we'd be fine	2344	A
yeah unfortunately	2344	A
because_1 because i often i often sort of wonder how	2344	A
having never been to the Soviet Union um how different the people there really are you know how- how much- everyone always thought of them as you know sort of the	2344	A
yeah	2344	A
right	2344	A
i would i would love to go there i mean like again- again not now but at some point to go see what what i mean what this is like i mean this this is amazing because_1 this is	2344	A
this is an an i mean this is an example of an entirely different culture that wants to be like us like you said before as well so it'd be interesting to watch	2344	A
yeah that's that's and and the ones they even feel	2344	A
somewhat worse for even um the ones in like the Baltic States	2344	A
where they don't have a strong leader that you know at least at least Russia has some sort of strong leader i mean they have Yeltsin who may who may yet sort of help Russia	2344	A
but um i mean the Baltic States i think are just sort of trapped i mean they were taken over couple of you know not too long ago	2344	A
and then just sort of told well you're here now you're part of our country and	2344	A
you be this way	2344	A
uh i- i think it's a sad state of affairs but	2344	A
oh yeah the yeah	2344	A
um-hum	2344	A
right	2344	A
um-hum	2344	A
yeah well that yeah and that	2344	A
um um actually it sounds very i mean very similar they're sort of being they were sort of forced and now they just want to sort of speak up and say hey we want our piece	2344	A
and they have other problems they have Shiite Muslims to deal with	2344	A
as well as Saddam Hussein i- i mean i think their big problem up there is that they you know is unfortunately not only are they	2344	A
there- there's more than one group fighting for the same place where they all want you know whereas the Baltics are saying well we want our own we just want this little tiny piece of land	2344	A
um-hum	2344	A
yes yes	2344	A
um-hum um actually uh my wife is Syrian	2344	A
um so i- i also i know some of the history and so forth	2344	A
and and the actually the real funny thing is that i'm i'm i'm Jewish we're sort of like the Middle East peace talks ourselves	2344	A
so we i- i know that and i've been to Israel and i know and i sort of toured the area and i know that it really is very	2344	A
lots of different cultures in one place i mean and and it's the same thing i it's it's almost the same thing out out in the Soviet Union right now there you know there are	2344	A
you can't take a whole bunch of people who just aren't the same people and don't want to be together and put them_1 together forcibly	2344	A
i mean we did it couple of hundred years ago here but they wanted to do it	2344	A
so i could put the	2344	A
that's that's certainly true	2344	A
right um	2344	A
i wonder i wonder if now the people in the Soviet Union don't have ideas very different from that so at least	2344	A
that's possible-	2344	A
hello hi	2344	B
hi Ken my name's Diane	2344	B
yes i'm in San Antonio	2344	B
oh	2344	B
okay	2344	B
yes	2344	B
i think they'll always represent a threat whether-	2344	B
whether or not there's an active cold war or not	2344	B
uh it's it's a a totally different economy based on different beliefs and and uh different priorities	2344	B
and	2344	B
uh given the the uh military powers on both sides i think it's always a threat	2344	B
probably not no	2344	B
right	2344	B
um-hum and it's and it's recognized that the two great powers are us and them and and the great powers are always pitted against each other	2344	B
i don't know they they're going downhill pretty steady	2344	B
but i- i agree right now they're not i don't believe they're a large threat right now i think there's always some threat	2344	B
yeah	2344	B
actually i feel kind of sorry for them_1 right now because the people are are are uh wanting	2344	B
things that we have that they're not allowed i mean just some basic freedoms and and their government is not allowing it and Gorbachev seems to be going back on some of the things that he's been trying to push	2344	B
um-hum	2344	B
yeah	2344	B
yeah	2344	B
yeah	2344	B
see i'm concerned that that since he's banned demonstrations altogether that he's going to do the type of thing that happened in Tiananmen Square and he's going to wipe out no telling how many of his	2344	B
own countrymen uh right in the middle of Red Square and uh it's going to cause a more civil war than is already occurring	2344	B
i don't know i mean and it it might be something that he wouldn't be able to control	2344	B
um-hum	2344	B
yeah	2344	B
yeah	2344	B
yeah we've got our own worries at the moment so	2344	B
i guess as long as as uh they're fighting each other we don't have to worry about them wasting their time with us	2344	B
well sure that but that's a that's an impossibility i think	2344	B
given the the uh the differences in the world and people are just too different	2344	B
but unfortunately people people aren't that insightful	2344	B
they just see that	2344	B
this guy prays differently and to someone else than i do so therefore he's wrong and he's bad and we have to wipe wipe him out	2344	B
um-hum	2344	B
uh-huh	2344	B
no i haven't read it i've heard all about it though	2344	B
yeah	2344	B
yes but people grow up and they forget	2344	B
that's one of the places i would most like to go not right now of course but at at some point i would like to to go to Moscow and and	2344	B
to just to see all these things that you can can see on television now and can read about that ten years ago we didn't have this kind of information i mean we didn't know	2344	B
what things were like	2344	B
so	2344	B
yeah i and i the the people i just feel so sorry for the people in the country that they can't	2344	B
they- i mean they they can't do any they can't change it they try and they	2344	B
there's nothing that they can do	2344	B
um-hum	2344	B
yeah	2344	B
yeah	2344	B
it's it's probably not dissimilar from the uh what are they the the the	2344	B
i'm trying to think of the name of the the something like that in Northern Iraq	2344	B
who are actually who are actually countrymen of of i mean some of them were split off into Israel i believe and some of them are in Turkey when actually	2344	B
they they don't they're their own people and their own beliefs and their own culture system and they were split up into three different countries	2344	B
and and they're very dissatisfied and they're they're causing wars right now and	2344	B
and i don't think it's that different from what the Baltic States are are going through	2344	B
yeah	2344	B
uh-huh	2344	B
yeah	2344	B
yeah	2344	B
the the one that i think	2344	B
one of the women- women that i work for is married to an Iranian and so she has a lot of insight because she knows a lot of the history of the the countries over there and within five or six countries there are	2344	B
oh	2344	B
oh huh uh-huh	2344	B
um-hum	2344	B
yeah	2344	B
yeah	2344	B
um-hum	2344	B
yeah and i- and i don't think the people here two hundred years ago were that different i really don't	2344	B
i mean they had the same ideals and the same basic beliefs	2344	B
they they they might the the Baltic States might be feeling the same way that our forefathers felt when they were leaving to come here	2344	B
to to escape-	2344	B
it's it's hard topic- topic because is it is it is it doing a good job or a bad job and you got to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like i do	2316	A
well public school all the way up kindergarten all the way up to uh uh high school	2316	A
yes well yeah i am	2316	A
um actually- actually i think that i at the higher level education i don't think there's so much of a problem there it's pretty much funded well there are small colleges that i'm sure are struggling	2316	A
but uh it's the job that the the high school and the grade schools are doing that i see in a area like ours our school even a bad school is a good school up here where if i lived in New York City or Washington DC	2316	A
uh i would seriously consider moving if i had a child i wouldn't let them go to a public school system there but of course people are trapped economically and they can't do that	2316	A
well that's really too bad because it- it it's giving some people unfair advantage i mean we our high school up here is like a junior college in Florida what we learned	2316	A
yeah	2316	A
yeah	2316	A
oh they they have that down there that	2316	A
yeah it's like if if your father owns a grocery store and you're really interested in that there's no reason that you should take college prep courses when you can get some general business courses in high school	2316	A
yeah that's where i was fortunate i'm a i'm a technician and we had a vocational um electronics in our high school	2316	A
so when i went to my first year of tech school uh i had a very easy time because our high school had a a good program	2316	A
yeah i find that that the that in the in the cities it's more less the kids go there	2316	A
to socialize not really to learn and the parents send them_1 there because they're supposed to and plus it gets them out of their hair and i also find that	2316	A
that you can send a kid to school but if don't work with them as a parent i think you're putting your child at a big disadvantage	2316	A
yeah well i could i could see if a kid doesn't have any encouragement if they're you know come from a broken home and their parents are more concerned about	2316	A
trying to work and or maybe they're unemployed and they're mad at the world i can see where that wouldn't be very good for a a kid you know he's coming up will you help me with my homework and they're no get away from me i've had a terrible day	2316	A
so it's got a lot to do with economics in the area that you come from	2316	A
yes are they going to move to uh Mexico	2316	A
yeah maybe the maybe they'll bring their good schools with them you know if the industry comes	2316	A
hopefully they'll promote good schools because i know the town that i come from the the uh the large IBM plant has something to do with the top rated high school	2316	A
because of their tax base for one and plus for for the type of student that's going to that school it's going to raise the level of the school	2316	A
because your parents are engineers or chemists they're they're you're most likely to do better in school they're going to help you	2316	A
yeah you hope well i think i- i don't know i just think it it's it's a duty of the parent to do that	2316	A
i mean jeez my parents always helped me and i don't know it's just like you say it's the way you're raised and the economic situation you're in	2316	A
i can see some lady she's twenty one years old and she's got four kids a kid in her first grader i don't see where she's going to have much time for him so i don't know it's just like	2316	A
i don't know actually i think it i think it should be a civic level the city level and a a system level really to find out and to- to see what they need and not overinflate it	2316	A
like if the teachers are getting six percent raises every year when people in industry have been getting cut back and you're getting raises every eighteen months you got to go hey now wait a minute we're in a recession here	2316	A
we uh our town didn't pass the school budget this year and for the first time in many many years just because people are are in the recession and they're even though	2316	A
we've uh enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years now we got eight percent uh unemployment when it used to be four or five people are going whoa	2316	A
so	2316	A
yeah but i always see it's all it's all money this like a couple other topics we had talked about was crime It it's it's all money based	2316	A
and what you can do unless you just get down to the parent level and and then if you're in a bad situation where you have to send your child to a bad school	2316	A
who knows but- maybe we do we need some more Catholic schools support the church instead they seem to have done a the good job in the past	2316	A
in uh some places uh you couldn't go to a public school it was miles down the road and the only school you could go to was the Baptist school or the Catholic school so	2316	A
yeah the i don't	2316	A
or anything that would contribute see this isn't a subject that i think a lot about because i'm never faced with it because our school system in Vermont it seems to do a really good job	2316	A
is it	2316	A
well that	2316	A
well	2316	A
so you have to go to a lesser engineering school we have a very good public school up here and a degree out there means a lot it's a very good school it's it's University of Vermont um	2316	A
we also have some two year college well there's a four year colleges they all have a pretty good reputation but like you say you	2316	A
yeah and are you talking about public schools being lower level high school level or	2316	B
state school	2316	B
okay but you're excluding high-level education	2316	B
okay	2316	B
yeah i know down here the school's are you know i don't know they rate i moved to Arkansas and Texas after living in Ohio and the schools down here rate you know bottom ten percent across the country and	2316	B
having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school i can understand why because they're so far behind and so poorly staffed half the time the teachers don't know what's going on	2316	B
right	2316	B
well that was my experience going through junior high up there when i came down south for high school i was just repeating what i'd already done	2316	B
because we were so far advanced and uh the you know i'd been in a parochial school before junior high and you know even the public schools are behind the parochial schools	2316	B
so you know i- i like the concept they've got now where they have more directed education you know you you pick a career path or you get counseling earlier	2316	B
and then you you learn the things that help you rather than spending four years learning the same things over and over	2316	B
well they talk about it and there are a few in some of the more like in i live in a big metroplex and some of the the better parts of the metroplex the the suburbs that are richer have those kind of target schools	2316	B
but uh you know	2316	B
right	2316	B
or if you're going to go the science route you can go to a target school that specializes in science or art you know there's no point in you know i'm an engineering student and if i have to go take art classes you know i'm not going to use them_1	2316	B
and through high school i could have gone so much further if i'd gone to a school that was directed	2316	B
right in high school	2316	B
right	2316	B
i think the schools today you know the public schools are just they're just overrun you know they don't know what to do there's too many kids and not enough teachers and too many kids don't care	2316	B
and	2316	B
right	2316	B
yeah and you know there's some kids that you know want to go learn but most of them_1 just want to go play	2316	B
yeah that's true i'm wondering with the boom down here it's well not at the moment but a lot of the industry's moving southward	2316	B
so oh i don't know	2316	B
about that but a lot of the industry up in uh you know the northern states is moving south and i'm wondering if that's going to have any effect you know on what you see now we're we're we're behind down here	2316	B
i say we because_1 i live here if that might not turn around in the next you know fifteen twenty years	2316	B
yeah	2316	B
right	2316	B
you hope	2316	B
i guess you just have to wonder is it up to the is it you know who whose supposed to make the change the the state the government- the federal government you know where's the money supposed to come from is it	2316	B
you know what what do you advocate more taxes or better management of what they got	2316	B
yeah	2316	B
yeah	2316	B
starts hitting closer to home	2316	B
yeah they're a lot more strict	2316	B
you uh have to learn you aren't given the chance to you know screw off all the time	2316	B
well i know i'm in the you know the only reason i asked about secondary schools or you know advanced education is because down here you know going to the University of Texas the education i'm getting i think is kind of shoddy for a public school	2316	B
i- i don't think i'm getting what i should but you know in Texas it's next to free because they- they pay so much of it it's state supported	2316	B
but at the same time it's really not it's not like going to MIT my engineering degree will be nothing like somebody coming out of MIT and that's it's really too bad	2316	B
but that's i don't know i think it just builds on the foundation that they've already built you get people out of high schools and college- junior colleges that don't have the background for an MIT kind of curriculum so	2316	B
do you have any pets	2346	A
you must have a little farm then	2346	A
well i'm a i'm a sort of a city dweller and i got a bunch of kids so they've got to have their pets	2346	A
and uh we've uh lost a few this year but we've still got a dog and a bird left	2346	A
and uh	2346	A
the the kids maul the dog something awful they pull his tail and bend his ears and uh	2346	A
have a good time playing with him and the dog is pretty uh tolerant of them	2346	A
well they're uh seven eight and uh ten	2346	A
and	2346	A
yes well right outside in uh Falls Church Virginia	2346	A
yeah	2346	A
uh-huh	2346	A
well you've got part of your family up here then	2346	A
yeah	2346	A
well uh i just got a new bird for uh little Deb at uh Christmas time and we're still in the process of uh getting him tamed he's a little parakeet yellow one	2346	A
and uh we let him fly around the house	2346	A
and the dog being a Golden Retriever he he pays close attention whenever that bird is flying around	2346	A
well the the previous bird he uh got a hold of it uh two or three times	2346	A
and uh	2346	A
i found that uh well one occasion i i heard a little noise and i saw the dog walking away and i looked over and i see some feathers sticking out of his mouth	2346	A
and i grabbed the dog by the tail real quick and i discovered if you yank a dog's tail real hard he lets go of a bird	2346	A
yeah	2346	A
bigger bird or a larger cat to take care of the dog	2346	A
uh-huh	2346	A
well there is a a neighbor of mine used to uh uh know quite a bit about uh raising parakeets	2346	A
and she had uh a lot of connections when it came to getting good birds	2346	A
so she was knowledgeable all the different breeds and colorations and so forth	2346	A
knew what to look for when you went shopping for a parakeet	2346	A
uh i had a parakeet many years ago that uh she got for me	2346	A
and it lived to be a a pretty old bird	2346	A
and was extremely friendly	2346	A
uh i i couldn't keep him in his own cage he just uh flew lose in the house all the time	2346	A
uh but uh more recent years they moved away and i've been buying parakeets at the local pet shop	2346	A
and they don't seem to be as healthy as uh one's you get from uh breeders	2346	A
yeah	2346	A
uh-huh	2346	A
well we found in general when you you look for breeders you don't find them in the uh metropolitan areas	2346	A
they you wind up going many miles out of town to find somebody that's handling whatever it is you're looking for	2346	A
we went looking for uh rabbits	2346	A
and we had to go all the way out to Leesburg to find uh a rabbitry a few years back	2346	A
weren't any uh rabbits available in this area except little bunnies available at the uh pet shops	2346	A
and we looked at them and decided they weren't uh too healthy looking	2346	A
uh-huh	2346	A
yeah	2346	A
huh	2346	A
yeah	2346	A
that's pretty unusual because we- i've generally found that rabbits have been very uh very good parents	2346	A
uh-huh	2346	A
yeah we had a rabbit up until uh last summer and we gave him away because the girls lost interest in him and couple of them we're getting allergic to rabbits	2346	A
uh	2346	A
i uh we we had a tough time deciding on a name so i named him uh Mister Tibbar	2346	A
and they wanted to know how i figured out that name and i said well it's rabbit spelled backwards	2346	A
so uh	2346	A
one of my other daughters got a uh gerbil and they came to me for a name and i said well name him Libreg	2346	A
and they said well how did you get that name i said well that's gerbil spelled backwards	2346	A
well they wouldn't let me name the dog	2346	A
well	2346	A
yeah well we had uh i lived on a farm when i was growing up and when we bought the farm there was uh couple of farm cats on the property	2346	A
and they were sort of tame every now and then they'd let you pet them	2346	A
but uh one of the cats which we named Bug Eyes she had a litter of kittens and she kept them away from the uh the house until they were pretty good size kittens	2346	A
and they wouldn't let you get anywhere near them	2346	A
and one day i went over to i found them sleeping and i went over and picked one of them up and it boy it was like picking up a buzz saw	2346	A
yeah	2346	A
but i tried again a few weeks later but this time i put on some leather gloves	2346	A
and my father still wondered what happened to those leather gloves	2346	A
well it's been nice talking to you	2346	A
all right	2346	A
bye	2346	A
uh right now i have um uh two longhair miniature dachshunds	2346	B
i also raise uh peacocks ducks i have three different kinds of ducks and i raise geese and rabbits	2346	B
but the uh uh the dogs and the peacocks are pets the rest of them we we do those for food	2346	B
yeah yeah we live out in the country	2346	B
so what do you have	2346	B
uh-huh	2346	B
yeah that's that's always nice when you have an animal that the kids can play with like that how old are the kids	2346	B
huh you said your from DC	2346	B
I have	2346	B
oh okay i have a	2346	B
my- my i have a daughter i think she's in Spring Field i'm not sure she's around there somewhere she just got her a new apartment	2346	B
and my other daughter and son-in-law live in Germantown	2346	B
so	2346	B
there	2346	B
yeah yeah so it's	2346	B
interesting to talk to somebody from that general vicinity	2346	B
yeah	2346	B
i wonder what he'd do if he ever got a hold of him though	2346	B
oh oh	2346	B
next time you'll have to try a bigger bird	2346	B
we have some friends that in fact the ones that we bought one of the dogs from they also raise birds and they have uh	2346	B
two or three different kinds of of parrots and then they raise finches and parakeets and they show	2346	B
and he and he was showing me his parakeets and and he calls them an English parakeet and he said their marking is a little different	2346	B
have did did you know that there was a difference in the parakeets	2346	B
yeah	2346	B
you might check uh some of the ads in the paper and see if anybody has an aviary that you might be able to buy from there	2346	B
that seems to be an up and coming business i know out there where we are there's there's uh a person on each side of our	2346	B
county that now have aviaries	2346	B
one of them is right out there close to us they're in the process of building it up right now	2346	B
i know	2346	B
uh-huh	2346	B
yeah that's the problem with buying them through the pet shops we have that same problem here too	2346	B
yeah but we've used it we just have two rabbits right now we have one doe and one buck	2346	B
and she ought to be due sometime toward the end of this week on a litter we just got her	2346	B
the uh	2346	B
we go we had uh one doe that we'd had	2346	B
her	2346	B
let's see it was her second litter i guess the first litter she had she lost all but three	2346	B
uh babies and we raised those and then her second litter	2346	B
she wound up killing all of them_1	2346	B
and it took her like three days i guess before she killed all of them so we've we had to get rid of her	2346	B
so i i	2346	B
wouldn't tolerate that	2346	B
yeah well this is the first time we've ever had one like that we had been down we had	2346	B
gone from having one buck and and three does down to one buck and just one doe	2346	B
but that didn't work out too well so now we're we're trying to build it back up	2346	B
now that's a good idea	2346	B
no that one would might get you in trouble	2346	B
yeah unless you called it Dog	2346	B
we have been known to do that in the past we've we've got a couple of wild cats out there in our general vicinity	2346	B
and you know they're they're tame enough that they come up and want you to feed them but they're not tame enough that they want to stay around or come in or anything so	2346	B
you know those are just Big Cat and Little Cat	2346	B
huh	2346	B
i bet it was that they do that you know they they have kittens out there in the garage or out in the barn	2346	B
and the first time you try to get around the kittens you know it's you'd have to catch them with a	2346	B
uh a fish net or something because they scamper away so quick	2346	B
did you in	2346	B
well it's been very nice talking to you i appreciate having the call	2346	B
and uh maybe we'll speak again on this little test that they're trying to do	2346	B
okay thank you bye-bye	2346	B
yes	2303	A
i i	2303	A
yeah um i i suspect the apathy is is due to something like people just feeling that that their vote doesn't count anyway i mean why why bother voting if	2303	A
um if your vote won't make a difference so for instance in um the last presidential election i'm sure a lot of people thought oh Bush is going to win either way why bother voting	2303	A
that's right i think that's and and the other side of the coin is um people saying well if i really like the underdog candidate i still think they're not going to win so some are saying Dukakis is certainly not going to win why bother voting for him so	2303	A
i think- i i think that's a big uh a big a big reason for it how about_1	2303	A
um that's true actually i never thought about that that that's a good reason-	2303	A
that's true that's true	2303	A
um-hum that	2303	A
i think on the local elections it's actually um i think um i think people vote in the larger elections because	2303	A
they feel like well you know the country's real important and you know if i elect- if we help elect a president who's going to save us then the then the whole country will be saved but they figure local elections don't mean that much i suspect so people don't really worry about their local mayor or something figuring that you know	2303	A
um and i think wrongly figuring that that well what good is another mayor going to do anyway because our federal taxes are more important right now and you know and stuff like that so people think that that that they don't have	2303	A
um that that it doesn't- doesn't matter as much whereas i think it's probably just the opposite is true	2303	A
i think it's probably the case that people could have more effect on a local level	2303	A
uh	2303	A
right	2303	A
um	2303	A
right but	2303	A
yeah that that's possible i still think that that a lot of those people are the ones who really think that their votes don't make a difference though as well	2303	A
i think it's those same people who don't know any better about how we vote are are are a lot of the people who think that well look at me i'm just a little nobody my vote's not going to count anyway	2303	A
you know and i think that's probably a portion of the population that's massively under represented- i i i would guess	2303	A
that that- that portion of the population is massively under represented and	2303	A
hum what do they have to do with one another	2303	A
oh so they didn't want to wind up being a juror ever	2303	A
oh i didn't realize that actually that	2303	A
yeah there is there there there are much easier ways to get out of jury duty	2303	A
just go in and say oh i want to be a juror i can spot a guilty person a mile away	2303	A
well that that just seems to be a person who just doesn't care about much of anything around sort of you know doesn't doesn't sort of likes rights probably but doesn't like responsibilities- responsibilities	2303	A
no i think	2303	A
i mean that's that's what it what it boils down to is people like to say- you know people say well i don't want to be on jury you know i don't want to serve on jury duty i don't want to vote i don't want to do this and that well then they could you know i	2303	A
put them in the reverse situation in the place where they don't have the right to be on jury duty and and they don't have the right to vote i suspect their opinions would change very quickly	2303	A
yes	2303	A
yes they were they were doing that unfortunately what what they were they had they had no idea what they were voting on	2303	A
it turns out	2303	A
that's right but but it's the thought they all got out but you wonder if you know if if now the next election they have if only half of them_1 are actually going to show up or how many generations it will take until only half of the voters show up in Russia	2303	A
right that that's true	2303	A
right	2303	A
now if things go the way that that that that they are there i think that they'll keep voting but i think they'll wind up like us at some point where people sort of	2303	A
only half of them_1 will end up voting and sort of caring enough to really make a statement so	2303	A
you know i think i think that that the people who most need to vote sometimes are the are the ones who who are really out to make a statement because you know when when	2303	A
when you've got an underdog candidate who represents something and even if he doesn't win a large number of people voting for that particular candidate does i think make a statement to everyone else	2303	A
i think that	2303	A
yeah i think and i i think that's real important	2303	A
that's probably true	2303	A
yeah	2303	A
hum that's good that's that's- that's- that's actually real good	2303	A
i said well well actually- actually- the the female who i would most rally behind right now right i don't know much about her politics that's about a way the way she makes speeches is a is a local person for you is Ann Richards	2303	A
i don't know her politics i just know that uh i saw her speak in the eighty four Democratic uh convention and right then and there if they said to me vote for someone for president i would have slapped down my vote for Ann Richards	2303	A
that's very good	2303	A
that that's that's that's very good that's i i like that so i would uh i would i would vote for her without and i i suspect she could get a large voter turnout	2303	A
say i i i would think that um that that people like that i think inflammatory- inflammatory politicians are um or or emotional politicians you know certain very vibrant politicians tend to bring crowds out i think	2303	A
i would hope	2303	A
um-hum	2303	A
no oh i've heard of it but not necessarily i've heard it's very controversial though	2303	A
um-hum	2303	A
hum	2303	A
yes	2303	A
um-hum	2303	A
that's what	2303	A
um-hum	2303	A
hum hum hum well they're elected as well so	2303	A
so	2303	A
so they're going to be	2303	A
but	2303	A
that's- that's true that's true well	2303	A
well in some sense they they should be politicians in that you know you want them to respect the people and you don't want them to have you don't want a judge to be appointed because you don't want someone's friend to be a judge	2303	A
but on the other hand	2303	A
right	2303	A
that's right	2303	A
um-hum	2303	A
so how do you think we can get people to vote	2303	A
i've had one idea that i think is is is completely undoable but it but i think it- but- but i suspect it would work and the way to do it is to get an absolutely atrocious candidate who you never expect to win	2303	A
to go out and make inflammatory and ridiculous and stupid statements so that a large population of of of voters will go out and vote against that person for someone else	2303	A
so given a choice between you know so so if you have so if if imagine a world where you have two real candidates and one idiot who goes out and makes you know anti you know sort of um	2303	A
anti women statements anti Semitic statements anti black statements et cetera et cetera well then i suspect a lot of people would go out and choose a candidate to vote for just just to spite that person	2303	A
but i suspect that that that would actually never work	2303	A
um-hum	2303	A
that's an interesting notion	2303	A
that that that that that would be interesting yes i think that would work in some places yeah	2303	A
all right we need to discuss the voters	2303	B
on a national and a local level why do you think the apathy exists i blame it to apathy	2303	B
why should i go out of my way when it doesn't matter	2303	B
oh i think so too and i think the other thing is the news media- media puts such a blitz on it that they've uh they had it predetermined with a half of one percent voting you know	2303	B
and i i think the you hear the news you know you start out in the morning and all day you hear the news and by time say you get off work and go to vote you feel like it doesn't make any difference	2303	B
due to the overabundance of news we have available to us	2303	B
what do you think on the local elections though	2303	B
oh i think so too absolutely uh i think another thing	2303	B
and uh i'm making a judgment here that may or may i think it is totally wrong well	2303	B
i think that the people that are um- have um a lower income which you automatically equate with lower education	2303	B
tend not to be registered	2303	B
and they don't register and they don't understand that you can't go and vote and register all at the same time or when it gets down to the point of someone saying are you going to vote today they say well i would	2303	B
and i believe in this but	2303	B
i had an interesting comment one time a thought that would never have crossed my mind i had someone tell me that	2303	B
i will never register to vote because i don't serve on a jury	2303	B
so they were if they don't vote they don't have to be on a jury	2303	B
there is convoluted logic for you	2303	B
yes	2303	B
oh i just right right there are so many other ways but that one just it defeated me i didn't have any answer for that one that one was just beyond my imagination	2303	B
that's a good point you're probably right	2303	B
which	2303	B
and that was what i was thinking exactly about because in the Soviet Union they had an election and they had what like a ninety eight percent turnout	2303	B
a massive turnout at last someone wants us to vote they were standing in lines to vote	2303	B
and their vote didn't count	2303	B
or any one shows up	2303	B
total indifference you know what difference does it make back gone the full circle	2303	B
oh certainly there's a message there even if they lose	2303	B
oh and i think women turn out to vote for women too	2303	B
yeah- yeah i think- well i know it's true you see a lot of that you know rally behind the female she may lose but by golly we're going to make a statement here	2303	B
you know	2303	B
oh okay	2303	B
was was that the time no that was later- eighty four that's too soon she said something about uh	2303	B
Ginger Rogers did- did everything Fred	2303	B
Astaire did and she did it backwards in high heels	2303	B
she said that i didn't said you know don't tell me what women can do	2303	B
i think i did vote for her as a matter of fact i'm pretty sure i did	2303	B
well and some of the issues are so emotional	2303	B
you know some of the really the really emotional ones have you followed the Dallas elections on zoning	2303	B
i	2303	B
everyone has made so many statements i don't live in Dallas county	2303	B
but	2303	B
i've heard so many statements that i've lost track	2303	B
i honestly at this point	2303	B
it's it's just too blown out of proportion for everyone you really even the news you cannot follow	2303	B
what the story- the actual facts are at this point i don't i don't really know if some of the poor judges that are just trying to decide how it should be divided	2303	B
i wonder about them at some point	2303	B
that's correct	2303	B
and that's another- and that's another interesting question should judges be elected or appointed	2303	B
are they politicians	2303	B
sure	2303	B
or you want to take the other side of it you can argue that's one of those you can pick either side and we could spend a lot of time on it because	2303	B
it's it's difficult	2303	B
it's situational really	2303	B
uh	2303	B
uh	2303	B
oh	2303	B
hum	2303	B
well this is true this is true i was worrying uh along the lines of you get everytime someone puts in a ballot in a ballot box	2303	B
a dollar bill comes out the bottom	2303	B
that might work in some places	2303	B
okay	2389	A
oh i think i think that the um woman's role has come a long way we've gone more into the business aspect of uh	2389	A
like i say of i don't know working more and then and we i think we've even gone into more of the labor aspect of it also	2389	A
uh with the pay and everything you know	2389	A
yeah	2389	A
uh-huh	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
yeah	2389	A
uh-huh	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
oh and a lot of times you can't yeah	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
yeah my mom um she's a housewife and well there's twelve kids in my family so my mom never could really work you know because_1 she was kind of pregnant from day one she never really had a chance to work	2389	A
uh she worked before she got married but um she um she doesn't believe in she's very old fashioned she doesn't believe in the woman working unless she has to	2389	A
yeah	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
yeah	2389	A
yeah uh-huh	2389	A
yeah um and also like my mom my mom thinks and i mean she she's kind of right with it when both	2389	A
um partners of of the marriage work she feels that that's taking more away from- that's that's increasing more unemployment for people that need to work	2389	A
you know like for for the men that don't have jobs if you know she feels that if those women weren't out there just because they want to do it she said that you know they could stay at home and with- yeah	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
yeah	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
yeah	2389	A
well what- what do you think about that do you think that um	2389	A
what- do- what do you think about the women that are not having families because they want to continue their business	2389	A
i	2389	A
uh-huh	2389	A
uh-huh	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
or they won't be as good as they could be	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
yeah	2389	A
uh-huh	2389	A
uh-huh	2389	A
exactly	2389	A
uh-huh	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
oh my	2389	A
Bless you	2389	A
uh-huh	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
yeah i i agree	2389	A
uh-huh	2389	A
and they just enjoyed the income the extra	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
exactly	2389	A
oh i know	2389	A
uh-huh	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
exactly	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
see yeah see now um my parents there's no way they could afford to send twelve kids to college and um	2389	A
so far there's only two of us that have gone and my older brother has paid his entire way and i'm on my i have six weeks left for- and i'll you know i'll graduate and i paid my entire way and that's the way it'll go down the line and	2389	A
like we- i don't have a car because i'm paying for college if i want a car my parents always said if we wanted a car we paid for the car and we paid for our own insurance and and i think that's right because	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
yeah	2389	A
um-hum like i've had my you know like um like i know kids up here that have their own cars their money's just given to them_1 like they still get their allowance they're twenty years old and they still get an allowance	2389	A
well i've held a summer job since i you know i was in the eleventh grade	2389	A
and i have had to take care of my own money i have my own checking account i pay for my own life insurance and i know a lot of kids that don't even know what- i mean i tell them i pay for my own life insurance and their mouths just drop to the floor	2389	A
you know	2389	A
well if they do they don't know of it you know	2389	A
uh-huh	2389	A
oh i know	2389	A
uh-huh	2389	A
uh-huh	2389	A
um	2389	A
actually i think abortion's going to take a turn where there's not going to be as many	2389	A
because i think contraceptives are going to be more popular i mean i realize that they are popular now but i think	2389	A
i i really- i really think people are going to start using more contraceptives and with the abortion it	2389	A
i i don't think there's going to be many abortions but i don't know what women will do when they get into politics you know about abortion	2389	A
i think it'll be freedom of choice	2389	A
uh-huh	2389	A
exactly- yeah	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
yeah	2389	A
i think if a woman would get into politics or enough women get into politics i definitely- i think it'll definitely be freedom of choice	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
i i do i'm Catholic and i we we're not supposed to you know say that that's okay but i really feel that it's freedom of choice	2389	A
i do	2389	A
um-hum	2389	A
and and different circumstances call for different things	2389	A
if you want to go first go ahead	2389	B
yes definitely	2389	B
well i feel that uh i we've missed as far as the top jobs go you know the the higher echelon	2389	B
because_1 if you look at most corporations there isn't a woman	2389	B
you know that's on the board of directors or that type of thing they're mostly all men there there may be a few but very incidental and uh i i really think that it'll be a long time probably before we see that	2389	B
in one sense um i'm- i'm an older person in my fifties so i feel that we've lost some things in the sense that women have to work today	2389	B
you know that that they're not in the home by choice anymore	2389	B
it's- most of the time- you know even- even if you want to say home you can't- you really can't	2389	B
it's- it's- it's-	2389	B
you- you know it's it's gotten to be a two income family to just survive today between taxes and the cost of living and i don't think raises have kept up with you know a lot of the stuff	2389	B
uh you know as far as your medical insurance and uh just groceries and gasoline and all this you know	2389	B
so i think that we we did come a long way in the sense that we have- we're allowed to vote in you know like you say we're out in the labor force but i think we've lost something too	2389	B
oh God love her	2389	B
yeah	2389	B
that's what i mean and and you know there's a lot of truth to that if you're not going to have a family then that's fine then you- you know a career is is a smart choice and i think it's great	2389	B
but if you you have a family i think you owe the family a responsibility	2389	B
and to have children and just get a day care or someone to take care of it and not really have the bonding process that takes place with babies and stuff you know	2389	B
uh i think that both the mother and the child lose and i think that's why there's so many problems you know with kids today because_1 they don't have the family roots anymore	2389	B
you know i'm not saying that that it's totally gone but it's nothing like what it used to be	2389	B
you know in that sense	2389	B
oh definitely	2389	B
that's right	2389	B
they don't want to take care of the kids and the house and that kind of thing that's very true but then they shouldn't have a family	2389	B
that's what i'm saying you know i i think it's great that women have a choice today	2389	B
that there are ways to prevent families you know like those basically there's contraceptives and all kinds of ways to prevent pregnancies there's no need to have children if you don't want them	2389	B
that's fine that that's the freedom of choice and i i agree with that because anyone who has children that doesn't really want them isn't going to be a good parent	2389	B
uh well i shouldn't say they're not going to be a good parent they won't be a caring parent like they won't have that uh	2389	B
right that's- that's what i mean it they'll feel like it's uh a job	2389	B
it's- it's not like something that they really wanted	2389	B
like i had three children and i mean i i i wanted every one of them	2389	B
i'm not sorry i had any of them_1 and i worked third shift for a good part of my life just so i would be home with them	2389	B
you know i had to work but i tried to make it as painless as possible	2389	B
in fact at one time i worked as a second shift and uh uh one Saturday morning we were all sitting at the breakfast table and the kids were talking daddy this daddy that daddy this daddy that and i was sitting there it was like i didn't belong anymore	2389	B
and it was because i had worked for about nine months	2389	B
and when they were coming home i was going to work	2389	B
and i wasn't there at supper time or bed time or they couldn't tell me what went on at school because they'd be coming in the door i'd be going out	2389	B
so we were i i felt i was losing my family	2389	B
and that's why i said that's it i either have to quit or you know try something else so i went on third shift	2389	B
and i worked that shift for eleven years	2389	B
yeah	2389	B
yeah just so that my kids would would have me at home	2389	B
you know and i feel that's very important it really is and it's too bad because- because mothers miss out on so much too so i mean in the sense that uh we've come a long way yes but we've sacrificed a lot to get there	2389	B
and uh i really think that if uh like after second World War when women went to work in factories and all that that was like out of necessity because_1 the men weren't here anymore	2389	B
but then it got to be a point where they got some independence	2389	B
exactly a man can afford the necessities a woman affords the luxuries	2389	B
and i notice today's uh kids you know like we had apartments before we had homes	2389	B
and we had to walk before we had a car	2389	B
and now kids at sixteen years old they have their birthday what what do they get they get a car	2389	B
and uh it to me it's like we've lost our values in this country	2389	B
we really have and i i'm not trying to be uh you know a prude or old fashioned or anything but	2389	B
i i don't think if you unless you earn something and you've worked for it and you have a sense of pride about it because while i did this in uh you know no one gave it to me	2389	B
you'll take better care of that and you'll prize that possession more than someone handing something to you	2389	B
and it's just like college too i think that if a kid goes to college and you can help them fine but i don't think you should pay the whole way	2389	B
of course	2389	B
yeah	2389	B
sure	2389	B
but i'll bet your values are a lot higher	2389	B
you know your- your- and your self esteem and the way- the way you uh you know think about things is probably a lot more common sense	2389	B
than these kids that don't have that responsibility	2389	B
you that that	2389	B
sure yeah	2389	B
sure they probably don't even have any	2389	B
or yeah exactly	2389	B
and that's what i say you'll- you'll be- you'll be so much better off for it as you get older because you know a lot of kids resent things that parents tell them and and stuff but it's because you've been there	2389	B
and no one can tell anyone anything anything- you know you're going to find out for yourself but i mean i don't think you should just not listen to advice even if you don't take it just listen	2389	B
you know there's there's no harm in that whereas sometimes you can't even get that from a kid you know	2389	B
just attention you know	2389	B
but really uh what- what do you feel the changes in the future like with the abortions and that type of thing	2389	B
women in politics and	2389	B
president someday maybe	2389	B
yeah	2389	B
yeah	2389	B
yeah yeah	2389	B
well i i still think people have a choice i you know if you can live with it and it's not you know your conscience is clear	2389	B
then i mean all- all of us are going to answer to it one day maybe or maybe not i don't know i mean no one's said for sure you know	2389	B
but uh	2389	B
yes yes	2389	B
which i mean i think it should be anyway	2389	B
no	2389	B
yeah because_1 i mean you as an individual what you would do that that to me is your business	2389	B
and uh	2389	B
exactly exactly that's	2389	B
well probably my favorite TV program is Murder She Wrote	2306	A
i happen to be a mystery fan and uh programs such as Perry Mason and Ironside and Murder She Wrote and Columbo all of those uh are my- my favorite kinds of programs	2306	A
uh-huh	2306	A
well the	2306	A
yeah	2306	A
no well i don't think we get it here	2306	A
huh-uh	2306	A
oh what kinds of things do they uh show	2306	A
oh my word	2306	A
uh-huh	2306	A
oh my word	2306	A
uh-huh	2306	A
probably things that that there happen every day and we don't even notice them until someone videotapes them_1	2306	A
is that right	2306	A
um-hum	2306	A
yeah i saw that for the first time yesterday in the evening	2306	A
uh-huh	2306	A
yeah uh i have never seen her show but after hearing her sing the Star Spangled Banner anthem i will never watch her show	2306	A
uh-huh	2306	A
yeah	2306	A
oh yeah right um-hum	2306	A
do you	2306	A
oh yes that's a good program uh-huh	2306	A
oh okay	2306	A
well i think that they uh they seem like they are friends with one another and with all of their guests rather than just interviewing	2306	A
yeah	2306	A
did they	2306	A
uh-huh	2306	A
uh-huh	2306	A
well great	2306	A
course i have to admit i- i love uh when the fall comes i love uh football	2306	A
and i watch all the football games Monday night Thursday night and Sunday afternoon	2306	A
well and not everybody is	2306	A
yeah but uh i can't get too enthused about it yet it seems to me i have to feel that the fall weather to really do something uh with regard to football	2306	A
yeah i because_1 i always hate to see it end in January i'd like to see it go on for a couple of months but football to me uh in real real hot weather it just doesn't uh doesn't click now i enjoy	2306	A
going to baseball games but i don't enjoy watching them on television and i don't enjoy watching basketball on television they're they're both well baseball's so slow	2306	A
and uh basketball seems like all all that you can really see is run and shoot run and shoot run and shoot and um	2306	A
uh because the average person doesn't get to see enough of the entire floor to see a play get uh develop- develop	2306	A
and so uh uh i don't usually watch them i'll listen to baseball and i'll listen to uh like the Indianapolis Five Hundred i would not go and face all those crowds for anything in the world	2306	A
but uh but uh no i won't watch it i'll listen to it on the radio yeah while i'm doing something else but i won't sit still long enough to watch them go round and around and around to me that is very boring	2306	A
but i- i don't watch i don't sit and watch for long periods of time anyhow	2306	A
yes we certainly do	2306	A
are you	2306	A
um-hum	2306	A
sure right i guess so	2306	A
um oh with the Dallas Cowboys although they haven't done very well the last couple of years but uh they'll be back up there	2306	A
yeah they'll they'll climb back up again and that Texas Stadium i've been there that is a phenomenal place	2306	A
well and i think that's maybe what i like about it in that so many of them are totally enclosed	2306	A
oh i well i have and they're very noisy	2306	A
and uh then of course i've been up to uh Cleveland Ohio where the Cleveland Browns play and that's just a wide open stadium and that cold wind comes off the lakes and it is miserable oh	2306	A
but um now go down to Cincinnati and they have a nice stadium down there but it's it's all open also	2306	A
two yeah	2306	A
yeah and then of course Indianapolis which is only a hundred miles away from us has the Colts yeah	2306	A
so uh they they've got a lot of sports going on around here	2306	A
uh-huh	2306	A
oh yeah	2306	A
oh yeah	2306	A
well i uh	2306	A
i'm retired from education i	2306	A
worked thirty four years as a teacher and administrator in the Dayton here this the Dayton school system	2306	A
and uh several of my players uh players several of my former students uh played with Minnesota Vikings and then with the Cleveland Browns	2306	A
yeah it was it was fun because uh they would call when they were with the Browns they would call and say we left tickets at the gate for you all come on up so we would hop in the car the next morning and drive up and	2306	A
we have tickets waiting for us	2306	A
yeah	2306	A
yeah	2306	A
oh	2306	A
oh sure one of them was grown up and was Chief of Police here	2306	A
yeah right when you see the ones who are successful and there are many of them around and uh makes me feel good to know i played one small part in their rearing	2306	A
well i- i uh when i first started out teaching it was uh at college level	2306	A
and then uh after we moved here to Dayton then i went to the high school level i really enjoyed that more	2306	A
and so then i taught the physical education actually uh with the i was the specialist in water safety and uh so i taught uh the the uh physical education	2306	A
and swimming um on the high school level and then they just kept pushing me into administration and	2306	A
and i wound up as an assistant principal and then i went down to the central office and was part of a team to to to develop a program to evaluate schools and and	2306	A
to uh try to resolve problems within schools	2306	A
yes sure i was also a gymnast when i was very small in a Czechoslovakian Turner Society and and yeah and had the opportunity of uh competing nationally and	2306	A
they had things that were similar to the Olympics uh the Czechoslovakian Turner Society did so it was it was exciting we competed on the rings and balance beam	2306	A
so what is your favorite TV program	2306	B
yeah uh um i've watched Murder She Wrote a couple of times but um i like mysteries and i do like Columbo but there i- what is opposite Murder She Wrote there's something else that i watch i think it's that family- home video show	2306	B
that Famous Home Video is what's opposite it here i don't know up there but um i like that because it it really makes me laugh people send in have you ever watched that where they	2306	B
oh they send in they do videos of funny things that happen at home you know and then send it in and they show it on TV and oh boy i tell you what it's it's hysterical	2306	B
oh gosh well uh one that comes to mind is a lady i don't know what the heck she was doing in her dishwasher but she was in her dishwasher- her head was in her dishwasher and her hair got caught	2306	B
and she couldn't get out and her hair it was and she was heavy kind of like me and so what what you could see was this big bottom sticking out of her of her dishwasher and her husband was	2306	B
say he was videotaping this thing you know there she is caught in the dishwasher you know oh it was hysterical and	2306	B
just real funny things you know people skiing and doing funny things on in the water and you know just really- it's it's really a good program i really enjoy that	2306	B
i know it and then some the winner the one that's voted the best wins ten thousand dollars so you know	2306	B
i really like that that's a good show and i like Rosanne now i know not many people probably like Roseanne but	2306	B
well she doesn't sing on her show but i- i do enjoy seeing that	2306	B
and uh uh so i like a lot of comedy stuff i guess you know but then i like the police things too Cops you know we have	2306	B
and i- i like that you know so i don't know i guess i just like a variety- variety of things and every day i just tape Regis and Kathie Lee	2306	B
do you like them	2306	B
i watch them_1 every day i tape them_1 well not this week because_1 it's uh they're on vacation so it's just old tapes but	2306	B
but every i run my VCR while i'm at work i i tape that and i watch it every evening when i come home and i don't know what it is about that show that's different about other talk shows	2306	B
yeah and she's so cute and her and Frank and the baby and i don't know i just you know they took it off down here for a while uh oh gosh for about a year year and a half well	2306	B
yeah i guess about a year and so i missed her pregnancy and everything you know and when they took it off i have never called a station before or complained or anything when they took it off the air here i called the station and complained i said	2306	B
you took my favorite program off the air and do you do you think it'll ever be back and they said no we don't think it will be well that was channel eleven and now it's on channel four	2306	B
so i'm really thrilled at you know that they you that they have it here so	2306	B
oh	2306	B
my mother does too i'm not a big i used to be a football fan i don't know what happened i'm just not a football fan anymore	2306	B
yeah but my mother does not miss a game and you just don't know she lives in California and i do not call her on Sunday in football- during football season i just don't do it	2306	B
you know she might call me during a halftime or after the game or something but i just don't call her and now they're starting up with new football	2306	B
it's	2306	B
you think it's seasonal you think it goes with the season	2306	B
yeah	2306	B
but you watch it	2306	B
oh listen to it	2306	B
yeah	2306	B
yeah	2306	B
now see in Ohio you really have four seasons don't you	2306	B
well we kind of do but ours our it its hot here i'm in shorts	2306	B
and people have their air conditioners on already it has been hot and humid here and so but our summers sometimes start in June and they don't end till like November i mean it's hot so we watch football in the heat here	2306	B
so i it might not matter Texans are real football minded people	2306	B
oh	2306	B
oh well i know	2306	B
i think so i think they did better this last year so	2306	B
yeah people say they wish they had a roof on it though it doesn't look finished	2306	B
i've never been in an enclosed one	2306	B
yeah yeah so Ohio has how many football teams two well so does Texas	2306	B
that's right they have the Colts now like	2306	B
yeah i went one time to um okay Minneapolis	2306	B
ah to the uh Vikings i went to a Viking Bear game one year oh many years ago now my gosh it's probably been twenty years and that was a real experience because_1 there are some fans there and i guess that's a big game	2306	B
oh	2306	B
oh how neat	2306	B
oh	2306	B
on that's wonderful- oh that's what an experience to see your students you know grown up and playing football	2306	B
oh that must be neat to see what happens to them like that	2306	B
yeah you sure did what grade did you teach or	2306	B
oh my gosh	2306	B
so no wonder you like sports so you were a physical education teacher	2306	B
oh that's wonderful	2306	B
well how about you do you use PCs	2372	A
you and i both	2372	A
uh-huh	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
uh-huh	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
well i have an i an IBM PS two model thirty	2372	A
and uh it's kind of it's getting kind of too slow for me but my job i'm an EDP auditor so i audit uh computer applications both on the PC and the mainframe level	2372	A
and i just use my PC constantly not only do i do PC type things like uh using lotus or word processors	2372	A
i also use my PC to emulate a mainframe terminal for our IBM mainframe and also to emulate a deck terminal for our deck machine	2372	A
so all i have on my desk is my PC but i'm i'm getting not only our local area network but i'm getting two separate mainframe machines also	2372	A
huh-uh	2372	A
huh-uh	2372	A
huh-uh	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
yeah i've become kind of the PC guru in our audit department because it's mostly financial auditors with an accounting back ground	2372	A
and there's uh three of us EDP auditors and one of the three of us has an accounting background and so she's not real proficient in PCs and the other	2372	A
just hasn't used PCs that much so i ended up taking on the load of making sure everybody knows what they're doing and i'm the administrator for our local area network and i need to keep that going and	2372	A
so	2372	A
i i'm i couldn't live my life without a PC now i don't have one at home	2372	A
which- which-	2372	A
yeah i would- right now i would rather not have one at home because i would work at home	2372	A
um we've got a couple of portable lap top PCs at the office that i end up bringing one of them home a lot	2372	A
to do work and if i had a machine already installed at home i would probably work just about every night	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
uh-huh	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
uh-huh	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
yeah just the power i'm i'm trying to uh get an upgraded machine mine is uh just putting along and it's just not fast enough for me	2372	A
so i want to get a new uh four eighty six chip but i don't know	2372	A
i don't know if my boss will spring for it	2372	A
but i'm i'm i'm	2372	A
i determined to brake mine so he has to get me another one	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
well that's what i do we had a printer a a Hewlett Packard Ready Writer	2372	A
and we had about ten people sharing this printer by it was attached to like a central PC and you had to take your diskette to the PC to print something	2372	A
so the first thing when i started work at this bank was i said well now first of all we need to all be able to share this PC without getting up	2372	A
so i talked my boss into investing in a it's not a uh yeah	2372	A
a uh real elaborate local area network but we can share the printer	2372	A
and we can uh send mail- uh files to each other and we can mail send mail messages to each other which is what which is good enough it's what we need	2372	A
and then i talked them into buying a HP Laser Jet	2372	A
and that was a major ordeal to get him to buy it but once he bought it he has been so pleased	2372	A
it's it's fast it's quite oh it has good copy	2372	A
yeah i've i've got a little little uh IBM Pro Printer on my desk but and i can use either the Pro Printer or i've got my PC configured to where i can use either printer the one that's on the network or my own	2372	A
so if i just need something real quick and i don't feel like getting up and going and getting what i printed i can just print it in my office	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
they have gotten really cheap Hewlett Packard makes it's it's actually a dot matrix printer	2372	A
but the quality is almost uh laser quality	2372	A
and i think it's called the desk jet	2372	A
and they're under i think they're uh about eight hundred dollars now	2372	A
oh	2372	A
huh-uh	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
i mean that's all you need for like for like bullet charts and stuff you don't need them in four colors	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
yeah use the sneaker net system	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
yeah we used to have to just sit and wait while someone else was using the printer	2372	A
until they got off the machine	2372	A
that was uh i was amazed when i came to work i worked at the uh	2372	A
well it used to be the largest bank in San Antonio until N C N B came in and bought up the rival and now N C N B's got a little larger market share	2372	A
but it's the it's the only uh	2372	A
well it's part of the bank holding company and that bank holding company of the ten largest banking holding companies in Texas it's the only one that's still alive	2372	A
so any way i work in a in a big prestigious place	2372	A
and i couldn't believe when i walked in the door on my first day and here's the audit department of this this huge holding company sharing a HP Rugged Writer	2372	A
i was going oh wait a minute	2372	A
come on guys this is crummy	2372	A
yeah yeah we're we're pushing real hard though we're we're trying well see the the entire bank is not like that we the the bank philosophy is one of innovation- innovation and lead the market	2372	A
it's just the audit department happened to be just a little behind the times because the uh the senior vice president over audits is cheap	2372	A
and it's real hard to pry money out of him to to to- do these things but i was i was able to convince him that it would be cost effective and that our board presentations would be much better and	2372	A
so	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
yeah	2372	A
unfortunately the the uh computer equipment and and related peripherals are changing and improving so rapidly like for instance we bought a	2372	A
oh constantly	2372	B
it seems like uh everything i do has- is computer related	2372	B
and if it goes down then we're stuck all day	2372	B
and so i like the IBM PC personally	2372	B
but that's pretty much everything i've worked with and uh i've become so accustomed to it that uh it's like- second nature	2372	B
what do you use	2372	B
yes uh-huh	2372	B
oh uh-huh	2372	B
huh-uh	2372	B
uh-huh	2372	B
oh okay	2372	B
oh okay	2372	B
oh we um we use an it's an IBM PS two also	2372	B
and um	2372	B
you know every now and then the file gets so big that you know it moves slower than i'd like	2372	B
uh but uh uh i we i do mainly um	2372	B
graphics on it	2372	B
and uh	2372	B
a little with word processing and then lotus- uh lotus applications to it	2372	B
and uh	2372	B
uh you know i don't know i just	2372	B
i enjoy working with them	2372	B
there's just there's so many capabilities out there i mean the things you can do are endless	2372	B
uh-huh	2372	B
uh-huh	2372	B
we have one at home but i just don't find the time that i can use it	2372	B
i	2372	B
yes uh	2372	B
uh-huh	2372	B
oh the- one of the reasons why i got mine was before i went on maternity leave they didn't know how they were going to do without me at work because i	2372	B
am pretty much the uh like you said the guru in the office uh with the uh the different programs and any trouble shooting that there is	2372	B
and um	2372	B
uh so they didn't know how it was going to work they're thinking that we were going to have to get a modem so that we could you know uh and a decks machine so that uh in my home so that we could make it through this eight weeks or so	2372	B
but uh you know it's uh	2372	B
they're they're really great uh it's almost like we could we could become too dependent on them	2372	B
and oh	2372	B
i the uh we use a lot of free lance and uh	2372	B
that's uh	2372	B
pretty much takes up a lot of our day as far as producing transparencies and things	2372	B
and um	2372	B
it uh you know compared to what the uh the way the things have upgraded have uh	2372	B
really they're what's the word i'm looking for	2372	B
i'm just totally drawing a blank we just but uh the way things have have changed over the years with the PC and the different programs is just great it's remarkable as far as the things that we can do now and compared to what we could do you know	2372	B
back a few years	2372	B
yeah	2372	B
we think about that a lot	2372	B
uh-huh	2372	B
oh	2372	B
um now that's awful	2372	B
huh-uh	2372	B
uh-huh	2372	B
oh okay	2372	B
um-hum right	2372	B
hm yes	2372	B
right the quality that you can put out off with one of those as compared to one of those dot matrix printers	2372	B
yeah	2372	B
uh-huh	2372	B
um uh we're just trying to talk ours into getting a laser printer	2372	B
and uh it's just so you- you know with budget restraints and things like that it's makes it difficult	2372	B
and	2372	B
uh-huh	2372	B
oh uh-huh	2372	B
yeah	2372	B
and we uh got a quote on some laser printers the other day at six hundred	2372	B
uh yeah i don't remember what kind they were uh but uh we uh do a lot of transparencies	2372	B
sometimes the color would take too long to plot- uh to plot out	2372	B
so they just want black and white ones and see we can just run them through the laser printer real quick	2372	B
because it will only take a minute to print one of those out and then run a thermal copy of it	2372	B
but uh it uh	2372	B
uh-huh	2372	B
no uh-huh if it was a customer presentation then that would be different we would want to to razzle-dazzle uh but uh	2372	B
it's uh yeah we we have one in the office and if we want to use it well in our area if we want to use it we have to you know like you said you had to had to change it uh put it on a disk	2372	B
and carry it over to there and see if they're not using the the printer	2372	B
right and uh wait for an opportunity to use it	2372	B
uh-huh	2372	B
i know i understand	2372	B
uh-huh	2372	B
oh uh-huh	2372	B
right	2372	B
right	2372	B
so how are you supposed to expect to stay number one when you're behind you know the times in technology here	2372	B
uh-huh	2372	B
uh-huh	2372	B
right we we find it hard to believe sometimes or hard to understand when uh	2372	B
we work for a computer company and uh	2372	B
how are we supposed to present the imagine that we're supposed to present with equipment that's outdated and when it's obsolete	2372	B
and the the guys that that some of the guys that run this place are very tight and it's like well why do we need this can't you do that with you know what we have and and when we try and then they complain about this doesn't look good	2372	B
so	2372	B
um-hum	2372	B
um	2347	B
all right	2347	B
uh-huh	2347	B
oh well i tend i tend to agree uh in some ways i think it's uh i think if anything a lot of um	2347	B
the changes that have occurred um in some ways they're for the better because i think women should have a choice and i do believe in the being able to have a choice as to as far as what you would like to do with your life but by the same token	2347	B
and i know this for myself because i've worked and i've not worked	2347	B
um that it makes it uh sometimes it makes life more difficult i think when the roles now are less defined as far as you know what uh women should or should not be doing that	2347	B
it it makes- it can make life more difficult there are more things to work out i know when i was working you know you have all these problems with	2347	B
with the child care and and with uh pleasing you know your boss on the job so you have added stresses from there and then you still have all the things that um	2347	B
that you need to do at home and and that doesn't change you know just because your your going out of the house for so many hours a day doesn't uh make those other things go away and the other responsibilities are still important um	2347	B
so um have you have you worked outside also and um feel that it that well how do you feel as far as uh what would be a happy medium or or what would you like to see	2347	B
yes	2347	B
uh-huh	2347	B
uh-huh	2347	B
yes	2347	B
yes	2347	B
right	2347	B
but yeah	2347	B
oh i believe- i think so yes	2347	B
uh-huh	2347	B
uh-huh	2347	B
yeah	2347	B
uh-huh	2347	B
well what do you think though um um i don't know i the the	2347	B
one problem i guess i have and maybe why so many women younger women now are choosing to go outside is i feel that in general in this society	2347	B
that being at home is not looked upon as um a job in itself whereas you know you hear a lot of women that are home saying that it is a job in itself but i know when i was working	2347	B
and i was a an engineer so i was always with men	2347	B
uh and they were single many of them and i tried to explain to them well my day doesn't end when i leave at i used to leave at three i keep going to eleven at night and they had	2347	B
they used to look down on women that were home they'd say oh i bet you go home and you know at least you get out of here at three and you can go home and put your feet up and watch soap operas and i used to be infuriated because they really had no idea	2347	B
what was involved once i got home now taking care of them running them everywhere helping with homework the bath the whole you know everything	2347	B
um and i think that one reason that so many younger women feel in uh compelled to go into a profession is that they feel that if they stay home they are not respected	2347	B
and that being home is not a respectable uh position in society and there's a lot of truth to that and i don't know how you feel i don't know how you felt when you were home and what kind of feedback you got but i can see with the younger men	2347	B
that they definitely are looking down upon women that are home and yet by the same token i think some of it is jealousy you you once in a while you hear them say things like	2347	B
um-hum	2347	B
yeah	2347	B
right	2347	B
uh-huh	2347	B
right	2347	B
right right	2347	B
uh-huh	2347	B
that's true	2347	B
that's true	2347	B
yes	2347	B
right	2347	B
and they enjoy it	2347	B
yeah and they do enjoy it i i see you're right i see many more men in the supermarket in the parks with their children and i think that is healthy because children-	2347	B
right oh yeah	2347	B
yes	2347	B
yeah	2347	B
and	2347	B
uh-huh	2347	B
uh-huh	2347	B
uh-huh	2347	B
uh-huh	2347	B
yeah	2347	B
oh boy	2347	B
yeah	2347	B
well it	2347	B
well that that's true there is that part too and i guess we also have to examine though and although your husband's probably been as much conditioned as you know anybody else um i guess having-	2347	B
oh oh yeah and and you have to i guess you have to question too why a lot of the men especially i think middle age and older men why they feel that way and	2347	B
and i think it gets scary for them to see change also they've been used to being really to be honest in in society and in a way number one and they come home and everything's done for them and their meal is served	2347	B
and i think it's frightening to them to see the roles switching and i think i think this reaction comes more out of fear now my husband is	2347	B
um he's ten years older than me and but he has his attitudes are	2347	B
very much pro-women pro-career which is kind of interesting he comes from a culture where women are stay at home and do everything um and yet	2347	B
um he's the type that he is willing to have to take on more responsibility	2347	B
um if that meant you know for me to be able to uh uh advance or go back to work or whatever i'm kind of more <b_aside> thank you <e_aside> i'm kind of more middle	2347	B
of the road i think that when children are small i think it's okay for women to work especially there should be some a lot more part time	2347	B
but i think it's um	2347	B
i don't believe in this career you know this career drive when when they're small because i think <b_aside> they're downstairs Aaron <e_aside> i think that's very um	2347	B
unfair to to children like uh engineers usually work fifty or sixty hours a week i refused to work more than thirty i was part-time and even that was a rat race but	2347	B
i think you have to put in perspective that you know when the kids came home from school i wanted to be here i didn't want i don't want a job where i'm traveling around and and- i'm away and uh	2347	B
so i think you can have both it's more hectic but i think you have to put into perspective what your kids need first then	2347	B
i've uh as far as i'm concerned i find that the young women have lost so much	2347	A
because they have become more aggressive and more dominating and i think that comes about from their being a definite factor in the job market now	2347	A
i would like uh yes i have worked outside of the home and i was in one of those safe occupations i was a school teacher	2347	A
and we had one child when i taught for my two year career	2347	A
uh we uh then i stopped teaching after my husband's business- business was established and we had two children and i stayed home with those children and	2347	A
raised those children and now that my husband has retired i am back substitute teaching which	2347	A
if anyone has ever been involved in that some days it's fun and some days you wonder why you're even bothering because your fighting for your life but i am a fighter and i've always been a disciplinarian	2347	A
uh i'm i'm not real sure that the young girls of today are being forced into the job market as many of them imply i think they're going in by choice	2347	A
yes and and i have no problem with that but i think the male needs to be the dominant person	2347	A
and i think too many of the young professional wives in our small town of five thousand uh are not letting that happen they are very aggressive	2347	A
they're uh they almost have what i would call a killer -bee killer bee instinct	2347	A
and they have to be in charge and and i think- i think they lose a lot by what i call neutering their husbands	2347	A
uh-huh	2347	A
oh sure	2347	A
uh-huh	2347	A
hum	2347	A
huh	2347	A
uh-huh	2347	A
if my wife had an education and could support us and the only value i see coming out of this is that children now in in a two parent home they now actually have two parents because	2347	A
i see my sons-in-law i have a daughter who's a nurse and i have a daughter who's a beautician and i see my sons-in-law cooking	2347	A
and dropping children off at the sitter and picking children up from school and	2347	A
and having a much better relationship with their children than my husband ever did because he left home at five thirty in the morning and he got home at six fifteen	2347	A
and uh he ate his dinner and he was asleep in his chair because he was exhausted	2347	A
so now the young fathers are having a chance to parent and i think that's an advantage	2347	A
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh	2347	A
and i think it's a a wonderful advantage for the young for the for the particularly for the males for the little boys to have a relationship with their father and and i don't think you	2347	A
we get into so much of the mother dominating figure if if the father has more input there	2347	A
but uh i don't understand why the young girls feel like they have to build roads and they have to that kind of job uh to go out there and shovel that tar and	2347	A
and drive those big trucks and we just recently finished a long drive through the west a little over five thousand miles and at one point we sat down	2347	A
uh i didn't realize it but i sat at a counter to have a cup of coffee that happened to be for truck drivers only and here's this young girl	2347	A
with the tattoos and she was- has just had just driven a load of meat from Minneapolis to some place in Arizona and she'd been	2347	A
and i ask her how old she was and she was the age- between the age of our daughters	2347	A
and she had been driving a truck for seven years and i thought gosh	2347	A
i mean why would a woman choose that rough and tumble life style when	2347	A
i guess i'm still- i'm a maybe Victorian and my husband is a little bit of a male chauvinist in that	2347	A
he's a very considerate person but he also thinks a woman should be taken care of and and in the home and she should vote but after she talks to her husband about how she ought to vote	2347	A
now it probably doesn't work that way in our household because i have strong opinions about things too but	2347	A
uh i like being taken care of i like my luggage carried and my door opened and i think the young women are losing that and i think that's sad	2347	A
he was raised in the south i think that's a little war condition both	2347	A
uh-huh huh	2347	A
uh-huh	2347	A
sure	2347	A
uh-huh	2347	A
uh-huh	2347	A
uh-huh	2347	A
uh-huh uh-huh huh	2347	A
uh-huh	2347	A
uh-huh	2347	A
i think a lot of my problem with the young mothers is-	2347	A
yeah auto repair tends to be a a topic that a lot of people don't uh don't like i guess because_1 it's usually expensive and uh people end up	2384	B
not pleased with the job sometimes or not pleased with what they had to pay for it so uh i guess it's kind of a sour grapes type topic i just recently had um	2384	B
put a set of brakes on my little Blazer that we have and fortunately i- i could do most of the work myself but uh this last time that i	2384	B
got into it i got about halfway into it and started feeling a little bad i kind of {fluish} type and said what a time for this to set in i got the wheel off i got these brake pads off i got car jacked up and	2384	B
need the car the next day type deal so	2384	B
yeah so uh i continued on and just decided to do part of what i had intended to do when i got inside there which means that when i just get around to doing the rest of it i got to take all of that back off again and	2384	B
and uh start over so uh with little things like that it's it's still a lot cheaper uh that particular job for that particular model car runs a hundred and fifty dollars	2384	B
yeah just the front little disc pads but uh while you're in there you usually uh pull the rotor and and uh turn it down and and	2384	B
put the uh grease the bearings up since it's been a while since they'd been done and	2384	B
um-hum	2384	B
um-hum	2384	B
yeah the rear brakes just doing the just putting the brake pads in wouldn't be too expensive but it's when while you're in the front that you usually go ahead and pull those	2384	B
that rotor off and repack the bearings and you know that's twenty five dollars and the rotors another twenty five dollars and then the brake pads are eighty or something the labor and parts and	2384	B
i just go buy the things for for uh about thirty bucks and put them_1 on myself	2384	B
but uh it's a bit of a bit of a pain and you have to schedule it you know get around to find a weekend you can do it and all but still for the for the savings it uh works out usually	2384	B
um-hum	2384	B
um-hum	2384	B
oh boy bet that got warm	2384	B
yeah	2384	B
yeah that'll do it it'll cook the whole whole insides there	2384	B
hum i don't know what the	2384	B
what the solution for that would have been you would have thought they'd have put all those parts that were pertaining to that near the brake so if they did get hot they'd unfreeze	2384	B
that would be nice if uh all that was	2384	B
huh that's interesting	2384	B
yeah i'm glad we don't have that problem too often down here i've heard a lot of horror stories about people that	2384	B
go down a straight road long enough and the and the wheel wells ice up enough inside where you get ready to make a turn and and surprise you can't turn and you can't stop in a hurry and no i'll stay down here in the South that's	2384	B
it's a little bit different	2384	B
yeah that's true	2384	B
that's true	2384	B
well i guess the only other uh things that i like to do you know the oil changes and things that are not worth paying for at least in my neck of the woods so	2384	B
we do that kind of maintenance and	2384	B
yeah do the oil change- oil and filter and air filters and	2384	B
spark plugs and the like can't do much in the way of actual tune up now that the car now that computers taken over that control	2384	B
um it costs about a hundred and something to get the small module that reads that and	2384	B
yeah	2384	B
well i'll tell you some of the horror stories that the the male populace have done to the women i- i recall a a uh	2384	B
coed when i was in college some of the guys got together and decided to tell this poor girl the way to change her oil was to uh they showed her where to take it out and she did that successfully and then showed her how to	2384	B
uh put it back in but on putting it back in they had her put in they had her put in all four or five quarts of this oil with an eyedropper down the dip stick	2384	B
and she did it oh and it was just	2384	B
that was mean	2384	B
yep	2384	B
so i guess it it is to your advantage to either not have friends like that or take a little course in	2384	B
yeah	2384	B
yeah those have really cropped up uh years of late but uh	2384	B
yeah yeah that's	2384	B
that's true i usually try to catch the oil at eighty cents or so and	2384	B
and uh stack up on a case of that and grab the two dollars filters when they're on sale and wait for a good weather and go out there course getting rid of the oil is getting harder these days	2384	B
end up having to take it somewhere	2384	B
right	2384	B
well they get a little money for it i mean they they pay they sell it so they should be you know unless it's a hassle or a labor	2384	B
in you know just dealing with the customer maybe that's there only reason why they don't it'd seem like they'd just put a little barrel out there and say it pour here and go on we'll take your money	2384	B
um-hum	2384	B
right	2384	B
um-hum wouldn't catch right	2384	B
hum	2384	B
yeah	2384	B
well that's not	2384	B
yeah that's true	2384	B
that's not to bad then	2384	B
well i hear my kids are needing me again so i'll	2384	B
go see what they need and we'll maybe talk to you again	2384	B
um bye	2384	B
that's right	2384	A
get sick with the flu	2384	A
uh-oh	2384	A
wow are these disc brakes	2384	A
right	2384	A
well i have a Nissan uh Maxima and i had the rear brakes on those	2384	A
redone but i guess auto repairs are cheaper around here i think it was around eighty five dollars	2384	A
is expensive uh-huh	2384	A
uh-huh	2384	A
uh-huh	2384	A
you're very fortunate	2384	A
well i ran into a problem with my car uh course we have a little colder weather up here and i had set the emergency brake after we'd had a freezing rain apparently	2384	A
and there's some kind of a boot that had- had come off the car so the emergency brake froze on	2384	A
and my	2384	A
uh brakes were on all the time i drove to work one morning	2384	A
it got warm it was pretty smelly by the time we got there which is not too far a drive but	2384	A
that that was the reason i had to replace mine	2384	A
right	2384	A
you would hope so but	2384	A
that you can't turn	2384	A
that's right	2384	A
i've seen your spaghetti bridges though when i wouldn't want to go over them	2384	A
you do that yourself	2384	A
oh you're	2384	A
that's right	2384	A
i've thought about taking a course just so i could change my own oil but and that would help a little bit but i haven't done it	2384	A
oh no	2384	A
oh	2384	A
that's crazy	2384	A
that is mean	2384	A
or take it to the pit and let them let somebody else do it	2384	A
they have but i really hate paying twenty two ninety five for an oil change	2384	A
when i know what the oil costs	2384	A
right uh-huh	2384	A
right	2384	A
uh	2384	A
well	2384	A
right some of the stations around here will take it	2384	A
i think maybe they have to accept it	2384	A
recycle it	2384	A
that's right um we were down in Dallas right after Christmas and on the way back we stopped in Louisiana to visit my brother	2384	A
and we were driving my husband's Toyota pick up truck well we made a quick little stop when we got to Baton Rouge and he came- came back out	2384	A
and the car the truck wouldn't stop i mean it wouldn't start	2384	A
so gave it a somebody came along and helped give it a little push and the next morning they took it to the garage and	2384	A
it was just a small private garage and he said it was the starter motor probably and he was going to take it off and	2384	A
either repair it or replace it or whatever and we got a call in the middle of the morning and he said i've got good news and bad news	2384	A
uh the starter motor is fine it would- it just had a	2384	A
couple of bolts that held it in place	2384	A
and one had been broken off	2384	A
and allowed it to shift enough that it wouldn't	2384	A
match just right and the only bad news was my husband would have to go to a	2384	A
garage and pick them_1 up pick the bolts up for him	2384	A
so he went to a used car garage i guess or place and got the bolts and	2384	A
had it running for about fifteen dollars i couldn't believe it because the man could have really stuck us	2384	A
no it was great	2384	A
okay Greg	2384	A
okay thank you bye	2384	A
sure	2337	A
okay	2337	A
is it	2337	A
well um	2337	A
yeah i'd	2337	A
i agree with the the ease in the use of it	2337	A
and uh	2337	A
the it certainly it's so much easier to do your do computations calculations to measure things with it to in every every aspect of it is simpler except there is one big stumbling block in it	2337	A
and in the United States and that is all of the tool and die equipment in this country that has been here for the last hundred years is in the English system	2337	A
and tool and die equipment doesn't wear out too often	2337	A
so i think that's the the one place where	2337	A
uh they will have a hard time uh getting people to change	2337	A
uh-huh	2337	A
right	2337	A
uh-huh	2337	A
uh-huh	2337	A
sure	2337	A
uh-huh	2337	A
uh-huh	2337	A
exactly	2337	A
right	2337	A
right i uh lived in Brazil for four years from when i was seven to eleven years old and	2337	A
so by the time i got into high school and took some physics there and then into college um where i was a physics major in college so i'm more than	2337	A
uh familiar with the metric system	2337	A
and uh	2337	A
but	2337	A
i think that initial period you know from way made it familiar for me so i wasn't afraid of the metric system and it and and i knew how much it made sense and how much easier it was to do things that way	2337	A
so i i it's too bad that more Americans can't don't have the opportunity to to really use it	2337	A
to to get to a point where it it's something other than something that causes them fear and confusion	2337	A
because if you just	2337	A
the initial- in the initial stages of anything no matter even if it is something that ultimately will be simpler are going to be confusing	2337	A
and it's getting over that hurdle that will	2337	A
finally get us into it if if we ever get into it	2337	A
right	2337	A
right	2337	A
okay	2337	A
yep	2337	A
right	2337	A
right right that may be true also i don't know chemists seem to	2337	A
it	2337	A
okay	2337	A
no	2337	A
i mean can you imagine how ridiculous it would be to try to do calculations- i mean it boggles the mind to try to think to do all the chemistry or physics in the English system at this point although gosh all those	2337	A
uh-huh	2337	A
uh-huh	2337	A
right it's interesting in the in though the work i'm doing i'm uh	2337	A
uh the kind of things i do is manage uh research and development contracts and we do everything from	2337	A
basic research all the way through uh we have a couple of systems that are actually um places where they're producing a product	2337	A
and what i've noticed is that the places where they're kind of doing fuzzy thinking and uh	2337	A
doing the initial uh	2337	A
development of an idea use the metric system	2337	A
and they talk in terms of metric uh uh units	2337	A
in turn around the people however that have the engineers that are actually producing a product	2337	A
do most of their carry conduct most of their discussion in terms of the English units	2337	A
which i i find	2337	A
it's interesting that it's like the guys that are still doing the work that are actually making the stuff are using the English system	2337	A
but the ones that come up with the they're doing these theoretical analysis and the number crunching um	2337	A
are doing it in terms of the metric system i i	2337	A
it kind of seems strange	2337	A
but	2337	A
and Sao Paulo	2337	A
uh-huh	2337	A
no kidding uh	2337	A
and do you fly into Camgonias or the the other one down there down south	2337	A
yeah okay the international airport-	2337	A
yeah	2337	A
uh-huh	2337	A
sure sure	2337	A
uh the Air Force Academy	2337	A
uh i'm one of those	2337	A
yeah	2337	A
no no i'm i'm still in the i'm still a second lieutenant	2337	A
i just graduated in eighty nine	2337	A
uh-huh	2337	A
uh-huh	2337	A
uh-huh	2337	A
uh-huh	2337	A
right	2337	A
right	2337	A
right	2337	A
oh that's it you got to	2337	A
oh yeah	2337	A
right	2337	A
well the the whole	2337	A
yeah i don't	2337	A
or the whole number system is digital so how can you have uh or it's it's base ten rather and so how can you have	2337	A
how can you have these uh strange- i- i-	2337	A
okay Brian i going to press number one and we'll go	2337	B
hey um uh Ronnie i think my first introduction to the metric system was in physics in college and i think prior to that i didn't even realize that another system existed	2337	B
uh but it makes so darn much sense to me	2337	B
over the English system i i i have a hard time understanding why people don't take to it	2337	B
yeah i understand	2337	B
no no	2337	B
yeah and i noticed that too in uh in uh uh metal stamp metal parts that we buy	2337	B
we at one time went back through and dual dual dimensioned them all	2337	B
and uh you know it's uh it's easy to put down point O O one inches or one mil	2337	B
uh it's kind of difficult to have its metric equivalent	2337	B
uh in in terms of the numbers that you've got to carry around i guess one of the things i i think metrically	2337	B
i've got a uh a and it drives my wife crazy you know she'll say how far is it from here to somewhere she wants to go and i'll say oh about eight kilometers	2337	B
and she'll look at me and give me this crazy look but my uh my my uh hobby is distance running	2337	B
and basically all of the races now are five K ten K fifteen K nobody runs in terms of miles anymore	2337	B
uh and i guess that's got me thinking metrically	2337	B
also uh uh we have lived overseas uh from nineteen eighty one to eighty four we lived in Quadalampor Malaysia	2337	B
and for in eighty five six and seven we lived in Baggio City in the Philippines	2337	B
and i guess you just get used to seeing distances beside the road marked metrically	2337	B
and ultimately at some point you know it doesn't happen overnight but at some point your frame of reference is metric at least in terms of distances	2337	B
okay	2337	B
oh yes yes	2337	B
yeah	2337	B
yeah i i i don't think it's going to happen in in in our lifetime at least not in mine	2337	B
uh i think uh there's a gigantic psychological barrier which may be a worse barrier than the old tool and die uh dimension in English	2337	B
uh and i think that the uh the ultimate solution will be to start introducing it uh in at at the introduction to school	2337	B
and uh hang on a sec Brian i got to get rid of that caller	2337	B
are you there	2337	B
okay i think the uh uh the solution is to start it at the earliest uh stages of schooling	2337	B
and uh uh make that the system to which kindergartners and first graders are introduced	2337	B
uh the drawback to that is i don't think we have any teachers in our other than physics teachers in our school system that are comfortable with it	2337	B
and and chemists that's what i got my first degree in chemistry too and i and i and you know we don't talk in quarts and pints we talk in liters and milliliters	2337	B
oh yeah i i i don't think we could even think English uh and i'm just thinking now in our business you know we make we make chips and uh we assemble them though	2337	B
and it's interesting we are uh uh basically talking well we talk about a package size yeah we talk about it in terms of uh uh six hundred mils or six uh tenths of an inch i guess we do that	2337	B
but on the other hand we talk about the force that it takes uh to move a die out of a package in other words how much uh uh how how well do we have the die uh inhering to the uh to the base	2337	B
and we talk about that in terms of kilograms	2337	B
so we use it a lot uh we talk about uh gold ball bonds uh bond strength we talk about that in terms of grams or in terms of kilograms to push the uh push the ball off its substrate	2337	B
so we we tend to have a mixed bag in new concepts uh that have come along with the electronic age i think just sort of get introduced metrically so that's the way we do it	2337	B
uh	2337	B
uh-huh	2337	B
right uh you you mentioned just a side light here you mentioned you lived in Brazil whereabouts	2337	B
oh Sao Paulo our our plant there is in Cantinas	2337	B
and i'm there several times a year	2337	B
uh and of course we fly into Sao Paulo and and drive on to uh uh Cantinas	2337	B
uh i use the other one	2337	B
i can't think the name of it	2337	B
yeah the international airport because i i generally fly in from uh well the last two times i've come in from Mexico City via Menaus	2337	B
and uh before that though it's uh it's uh Miami uh Rio De Janeiro Sao Paulo uh type flight	2337	B
and uh i just love it there i i absolutely uh uh uh love the i look forward to the times i go down there where did you get your from where did you get your physics degree	2337	B
oh okay okay	2337	B
yeah you like Colorado are are you a civilian employee about now or or military	2337	B
oh okay	2337	B
oh okay okay you're you're you- you're a bit younger than i thought uh back to the the metric system	2337	B
i've got a uh an automobile an eighty six Buick Skylark that's got an odometer uh that's a digital odometer in both units in other words i can push a button and it's in metric and i can push a button and it's in English	2337	B
and i i keep it in the metric uh all the all the time and we were taking another couple to a ball game last summer	2337	B
and it was uh floating up there around a a a hundred a hundred which is about is about sixty two miles an hour and it was floating up there about a hundred and the wife of the couple looked at me she said my God slow down i didn't realize you were going this fast	2337	B
and so we we you know we have a hard time getting people getting uh uh getting them to think metrically but	2337	B
it's going to be a big psychological barrier and i don't think that we can educate kids all the way to their adulthood and then introduce it to them	2337	B
because if we if we keep doing that it's it's not going to work	2337	B
but	2337	B
but but interestingly enough we think it makes sense to to think metrically with our money	2337	B
you know ten cents makes a dime ten dimes makes a dollar uh which is basically thinking metrically	2337	B
uh but but why twelve inches make a feet a foot and three feet make a yard i you know	2337	B
yeah	2337	B
all right	2334	A
um-hum	2334	A
um i wish i had	2334	A
well i it was done for me after a while i had a uh i had a business going	2334	A
and this was back in the eighties i don't know if you remember the gold and silver prices and all that	2334	A
but uh i had a coin shop	2334	A
and everything was going great while gold and silver was up and it started falling	2334	A
so i started paying expenses and stuff on my credit cards and things got worse and worse and finally boom	2334	A
yep	2334	A
yeah yeah it was i ended up going into bankruptcy- you know it was one of those things uh oh it'll get better next week you know things will pick up	2334	A
and so there i was in old bankruptcy court	2334	A
oh yeah yeah	2334	A
oh yeah yeah i was buying from other dealers and uh	2334	A
you know they take payment any way they can get it	2334	A
yeah course on on stuff that i was on merchandise that i was buying on cards it was i was getting the money back because_1 i was selling it i wasn't buying you know just to hold onto it	2334	A
um	2334	A
but it was things like you know rent and phone bills and advertising and	2334	A
all that other good stuff that ate them_1 all up	2334	A
so	2334	A
um-hum	2334	A
um-hum	2334	A
sure	2334	A
um-hum yes	2334	A
that's the way they suck you in	2334	A
um-hum	2334	A
um-hum	2334	A
well just today in the mail i got uh	2334	A
i got got my	2334	A
guaranteed acceptance by uh American Express	2334	A
yeah	2334	A
yeah as soon as your a graduate student they get your name	2334	A
and uh	2334	A
course i guess i guess i've been purged from their records i used to have an American Express	2334	A
uh back when i had my business i got one	2334	A
and	2334	A
they they goofed up bad on my first- on my very first bill because_1 i was using the American Express strictly for the travel expenses	2334	A
and the bill would come in and i'd pay it and the very first bill i paid it and then i got this nasty letter from them saying you're overdue pay	2334	A
so i- i said well it just crossed in the mail so i didn't do anything about it Two weeks later i get another letter even nastier	2334	A
and said we're going to turn this over to our attorneys if you don't pay	2334	A
and i looked at that and i said uh-huh	2334	A
so by this time my checks had come back from the bank so i made a copy of the check that they had cashed	2334	A
attached it to their letter and sent them_1 a nasty letter with the card cut in little bitty pieces saying thanks but no thanks	2334	A
yeah they were i tell you they don't talk about they were charging that enormous fee every year	2334	A
it's up to fifty five on the gold card it's eighty five for the Optima	2334	A
oh i'm sorry no fifty fifty	2334	A
yeah for the green card	2334	A
and it	2334	A
well now and that's that's the card fee	2334	A
oh yeah yeah it's um	2334	A
well of course on the green card you have to pay it when the bill comes in so there isn't any but on the Optima card it's um	2334	A
let's see right now it's running at about it's not too bad it's actually it's about sixteen and a half percent which is pretty good	2334	A
as far as credit cards go	2334	A
well they're dangerous	2334	A
hum-um mine don't either	2334	A
mine don't either they have um my mom has a uh has a MasterCard and a Visa card and that's it	2334	A
yeah yeah now i- i do use gas cards	2334	A
yeah yeah- yeah	2334	A
oh yeah exactly	2334	A
uh plastic is just too easy i mean that's the that's the whole problem with it um have-	2334	A
yeah	2334	A
sure	2334	A
naturally that's i got in all kinds of trouble doing that	2334	A
well	2334	A
having- having having been out of the credit game for some years now i've i've gotten used to either paying in cash or not getting it	2334	A
and uh	2334	A
well it is but i- i- i'm kind of uh grateful for the experience because it's taught me a lot of restraint	2334	A
uh	2334	A
yeah exactly i- i um i just went out and got a new VCR yesterday	2334	A
with cash	2334	A
and it it's	2334	A
no no i wish i did	2334	A
yeah i could use a discount i have to wait for the things to go on sale	2334	A
yeah especially on electronic goods	2334	A
especially now	2334	A
oh Circuit City	2334	A
yeah they they're not their prices aren't that terrific	2334	A
they they used to be but they've gotten they've got to pay for all that national advertising now	2334	A
um-hum	2334	A
yeah they're they're all over the country now	2334	A
they uh they- they used to be good i remember when they first opened up they did have good bargains	2334	A
i don't know if you have a place there called uh or you probably have something similar we call it Service Merchandise	2334	A
you- you got Service Merchandise yeah it used to be Service Merchandise was the place to go	2334	A
and uh Circuit City came along and that was the place to go to get your TVs and washer and dryers and refrigerators and all that	2334	A
and then after the years went by they just sort of kept creeping up on price and actually Service Merchandise is cheaper than them now	2334	A
so so much for Circuit City	2334	A
i don't i'm a graduate student i'm a professional student	2334	A
it is	2334	A
it's it's great	2334	A
it is great i love it	2334	A
NC State	2334	A
uh North Carolina State	2334	A
not yet	2334	A
ours don't ours doesn't start until uh next week	2334	A
where am i	2334	A
what do you mean where oh in Raleigh	2334	A
yeah good ole	2334	A
the burgeoning metropolis of Raleigh	2334	A
what- what a dead place yeah	2334	A
i've got a nice little business at home and i sit around and tinker with that most of the time	2334	A
um uh human factors	2334	A
not a thing	2334	A
uh its	2334	A
it's it's really looking at systems and design systems and seeing how people interact with them_1	2334	A
huh	2334	A
it's well it's more psychology and engineering uh my my master's is in industrial engineering	2334	A
yeah	2334	A
yeah PhD in human factors	2334	A
well	2334	A
oh yeah	2334	A
IBM uh	2334	A
i mean uh a lot of people use human factors folks but IBM is what i'm looking at right now	2334	A
they might be but not at not at the human factors level	2334	A
there there	2334	A
um no as a matter of fact the IBM right here or in Carey which is a little suburb of Raleigh just just hired one more human factors person	2334	A
doggone it if they'd just waited a little bit longer it could have been me	2334	A
um i'm i'm going into thesis- or going into the uh dissertation this summer	2334	A
uh i'm going to start this summer i probably won't finish it until the end of the year	2334	A
but uh i'm i'm trying to get a uh	2334	A
a uh intern position with IBM right now so that i can find an area to do my dissertation in	2334	A
it's hard finding an area to do a dissertation in this field	2334	A
but	2334	A
yeah that's that and and it's it's limited application in some respects um consider- in the area that we're in here there's a lot of places that use human factors people most	2334	A
well like i told you before	2334	B
and you're talking about credit cards	2334	B
we put ours up	2334	B
i mean i had a delightful evening one night cutting a bunch of those suckers up	2334	B
well you should try it	2334	B
yeah	2334	B
you lost your business oh God- what a nightmare	2334	B
well you weren't charging gold and silver were you you can't do that can you	2334	B
oh you can	2334	B
oh that's a nightmare	2334	B
um	2334	B
well i remember before i got married you know when you graduate from college they'll send you all those credit card applications you know of course you fill them_1 all out because_1 you're honored right and uh	2334	B
i had stuff for like Sanger Harris and you know it got up like to couple of hundred dollars and i thought well that's okay cause all they wanted was ten dollars a month right i wasn't thinking a thing about it	2334	B
yeah i was just stupid and every time they had a sale there i was because_1 you know got get such good bargains	2334	B
and i don't know	2334	B
oh yeah we've been getting those	2334	B
i went back to school and got my Master's and they started sending those things to me again	2334	B
yeah they did	2334	B
uh-huh	2334	B
yeah	2334	B
hum	2334	B
and now they weren't check in	2334	B
now what is it now	2334	B
what do you mean fifty five you mean fifty five dollars	2334	B
but then what's the interest	2334	B
and interest is like eighteen or something	2334	B
yeah	2334	B
well	2334	B
credit cards	2334	B
you know my parents don't hardly use them	2334	B
i've got all my gas cards because_1 i don't want to carry money around i'll do that	2334	B
now Impact is kind of bad too though	2334	B
you know especially if you get forget to record those little suckers	2334	B
uh-huh	2334	B
well and you're tempted if you've got cash a little bit of cash and you don't have enough for the purchase right	2334	B
of course you got to charge it and keep your cash	2334	B
<b_aside> what what are you saying <e_aside>	2334	B
oh uh my husband says i might buy it but i- i don't really usually consider that an option	2334	B
maybe that's how we got in trouble	2334	B
yeah but it's hard isn't it	2334	B
well it makes you feel good when you whip out the cash instead of your plastic	2334	B
with cash	2334	B
do you work with TI	2334	B
no	2334	B
yeah you could have got a discount couldn't you	2334	B
but there's always a sell	2334	B
yeah	2334	B
what is that thing i saw Circuit	2334	B
Circuit world or something	2334	B
Circuit City have you been in that	2334	B
oh it's national	2334	B
i think i've seen two around Dallas	2334	B
well what else	2334	B
yeah in Garland	2334	B
uh-huh	2334	B
sure	2334	B
okay what else can we talk about who do you work for	2334	B
sounds wonderful we were talking about that just today	2334	B
we could be just lifelong students	2334	B
where are you going to school	2334	B
what's that	2334	B
so you're on Spring Break	2334	B
so where are you	2334	B
yeah	2334	B
oh okay	2334	B
yeah	2334	B
is it	2334	B
so what are you getting your degree in	2334	B
and what do you do with it	2334	B
well what is it	2334	B
so it's sociology	2334	B
so you're working on your doctorate	2334	B
oh lord	2334	B
oh that'll that'll sound wonderful won't it	2334	B
get you a little name plaque	2334	B
aren't aren't they laying off several thousand people	2334	B
well i heard it on the news today i could swear it was IBM	2334	B
hum	2334	B
how much longer do you have	2334	B
and get that done this summer	2334	B
ooh	2334	B
because_1 you	2334	B
why there been so much work done already	2334	B
oh i guess uh it's hard tell i guess probably i didn't do much as a kid because we grew up on a farm and my whole life was camping uh but uh	2369	B
later on uh later on i think when my oldest daughter got involved she and i got involved in Indian Princesses we used to go up at Possum Kingdom and do a lot of camping at Possum Kingdom	2369	B
no no i'm i'm New England Massachusetts	2369	B
oh okay	2369	B
uh-huh	2369	B
yeah that	2369	B
that's they yeah kind of cheating isn't it	2369	B
no hum	2369	B
yeah	2369	B
oh sure speaking of uh southern Oklahoma uh you go up into the Arbuckle Mountains at all camping up in there	2369	B
yeah we went up to uh i talking about being an Indian Princesses i was actually in it seven years with two daughters four with one three with the other and with my second daughter we camped up at Camp Classen one time	2369	B
and uh well it's right uh	2369	B
you know i'm trying to think where it is it's not too far over the border and it's up in the middle of the Arbuckles and it's near Turner Falls	2369	B
and uh uh that is just absolutely when you consider how flat everything is here that absolutely beautiful company to uh country to camp in	2369	B
uh-huh	2369	B
yeah	2369	B
yeah	2369	B
uh-huh	2369	B
oh yeah uh another thing how about uh have you been to the Texans Texoma side	2369	B
oh for goodness sakes that is that is just really nice we kind of	2369	B
you know i've been at TI thirty two years and in my young single days i used to camp there a lot then i sort of forgot about it for twenty years and uh	2369	B
uh two years ago my children started asking- they saw picture of it over at Texans and uh we started going there again we sort of rediscovered it	2369	B
yeah and uh it got a lot a lot of campsites you know there's uh	2369	B
uh concrete pads that you can put tents on there's places to pull in RVs and plug them in up uh there's even two and what we we used	2369	B
they have got two log cabin shelters that are basically uh four walls and a roof log cabins with a concrete floor and a picnic table in them and a ceiling fan and screened uh windows	2369	B
so you can kind of go in there and just bring your sleeping bag	2369	B
and sleeping bags and air mattresses you can camp on the floor you got a roof over your head	2369	B
yeah let come what may	2369	B
yeah they're very close to the water within like uh a hundred yards	2369	B
yeah yeah they've got a place where you can keep your boat you can they've got the dock that you can tie up tie up and it it's uh it's in a protected area	2369	B
so and i i've got a son	2369	B
really started going about seventeen- he's seventeen now he was he was fifteen then but uh i've got a son son and both daughters like to go and uh they have got a a a dock uh down in the protected area	2369	B
where the fishing pretty good and uh	2369	B
you know we'll leave we'll leave him down there at ten o'clock at night with his fishing pole and sometimes go after him if a big storm comes up	2369	B
but you know he can walk back to the little cabin in about five minutes from there but it's it's a ninety nine acre i think it's a ninety nine acre in fact they have acquired some more now that they are going they're going to uh clear but it's a long term lease from the corps of engineers	2369	B
yeah yeah you you've got to be a a a Texas member but if you are a master member of Texans the the membership to Texoma is free	2369	B
uh you can you can get a family membership do you your family camp at all you you camp with your family how how what what	2369	B
oh boy	2369	B
yeah	2369	B
what kind of a boat do you have	2369	B
uh-huh	2369	B
yeah when i was yeah in my young in my young single days i had a uh Turbocraft are you familiar with that	2369	B
yeah i had a uh a uh sixteen foot hundred and nine horse power six cylinder one and i i had that for two or three years and then i traded it for a eighteen foot uh two hundred and twenty horsepower V eight	2369	B
and uh oh that thing eat gasoline uh we could suck up thirty gallons in an afternoon of skiing	2369	B
move you across the water and it would pull three slalom skiers without batting an eyelash	2369	B
yeah	2369	B
yeah plus it it it planed in about two inches of water so you never dragged on anything because there was was nothing under it but unfortunately what i did was and i i guess what what happened when i was single i had it	2369	B
and my wife and i skied a lot when we first got married and the children came along when they're real little they can't really participate and i guess i was paying more on insurance and maintenance than i was getting out of it and i sold it	2369	B
and never had a chance really to get back to boating again	2369	B
yeah	2369	B
yeah	2369	B
yeah you rediscover- rediscover you rediscover it when the kids get old enough to do it yeah	2369	B
yeah	2369	B
yeah right where do you	2369	B
oh okay okay i just i can- i just let me ask you one more question where do you ski uh where you ski	2369	B
uh-huh	2369	B
um-hum	2369	B
yeah	2369	B
yeah i'll tell you i i would recommend too Texoma is nice because there is no many places you can ski there	2369	B
and uh in the Texans area has got two nice launching ramps	2369	B
one of them is in a protected cove and the other one is okay if the lake is calm it's out more in the open uh the other place that i would really strongly recommend is Possum Kingdom	2369	B
and that is absolutely the prettiest that	2369	B
when i learned to slalom ski it was the only place i didn't mind swallowing and boy i swallowed a lot a lot of water learning and the only place i didn't mind swallowing half the lake and i didn't feel grungy about it like i did at Lavon	2369	B
ah no it's not over crowded it's uh it it far enough away so it's not over crowded and it's surrounded by cliffs so no matter how much wind it is there is always a big portion of the lake that's calm	2369	B
yeah its too open	2369	B
yeah and there's uh they have got some forty to fifty foot high cliffs around Possum Kingdom and you just get up and ski uh adjacent to those and uh and it doesn't make any difference how windy it is you don't notice it	2369	B
yeah oh okay well you ready to wind up hey nice talking to you my friend yeah good night bye-bye	2369	B
how did you first get involved in camping	2369	A
yeah	2369	A
uh-huh	2369	A
are you a native Texan	2369	A
oh okay	2369	A
i guess i grew up uh camping my folks were big campers from day one as far as i can remember we grew up in southern Oklahoma and they were uh we were always hit Texoma or	2369	A
some camping area all of either Texas or Oklahoma	2369	A
and i was involved in Boy Scouts as a young kid and we were camping uh seem like every other weekend we would go somewhere	2369	A
i when they talk about the definitions of camping it kind of struck me as funny my brother and sister-in-law	2369	A
who live in Arlington and go camping uh a lot during the spring and summer and fall but their idea of camping is a little bit different than mine they have a fifth wheel trailer that they pull	2369	A
that has uh you know two bedrooms a TV and microwave and stove and all that kind of stuff and he pulls it with a big pickup	2369	A
when i when i when i go camping i usually take a sleeping bag and some cooking stuff and that's about it	2369	A
well it's not like leaving home when you take it with you the whole idea is to get away from it	2369	A
i have been and uh some of the boy scouts have been up in there they have got some great hiking trails and camping areas up in there	2369	A
um-hum	2369	A
i'm not familiar with that one	2369	A
yeah	2369	A
oh yeah	2369	A
boy that's a fact	2369	A
yeah well a lot of my camping was up in the Arbuckles as i was growing up there's a place that used to be called Platte National Park up around Sulphur and Davis and and not too far from Turner Falls	2369	A
they have- i have heard they since changed name of the park to something else but it was one of those parks with a uh a natural	2369	A
uh spring fed river that flows through the camp sites you know all along the river the water was real cold because it was spring fed but just like i say it's a beautiful area lots of hills to go camping in	2369	A
uh dad never believed in tent camping uh we had some old army cots that we would sleep on uh uh come	2369	A
good weather or not a many of times we were sleeping out under the stars and it would start raining and we would all wind up in the car and that got pretty cramped sometimes	2369	A
a lot of good memories in in in camping you know it helps you unwind and get away and forget TI and everything else back home i guess	2369	A
no i haven't i've never been up there	2369	A
yeah	2369	A
well that that's true i've never thought- i've heard about it countless times but never thought about going up there	2369	A
yeah	2369	A
well	2369	A
well that would be great there pretty cold-	2369	A
shoot let come what may	2369	A
and they're fairly close to the water aren't they i mean they're right on the late	2369	A
they they got a place where you uh can keep your boat while you're there for the weekend	2369	A
yeah	2369	A
that	2369	A
yeah	2369	A
oh yeah	2369	A
yeah so it's time to quit	2369	A
that's great i'd forgotten all about the Texan side and that's but you got to be a member of Texans to use it	2369	A
yeah	2369	A
oh that's outstanding	2369	A
oh yeah	2369	A
i've got a boy that is uh thirteen and the girl is eleven the boy had learned to	2369	A
uh ski oh probably two years ago he's a slalom skier now and the girl's eleven and she just now starting to uh learn to ski	2369	A
i've got a sixteen and a half foot Bayliner it's inboard outboard just a ski boat it's about the right size for us	2369	A
yeah i know them	2369	A
you bet	2369	A
goodness	2369	A
yeah i expect it would	2369	A
yeah but boy it would move you across the water though	2369	A
that's what you want plus out on Texoma you have got all that you know mass of water to get across	2369	A
outstanding	2369	A
uh-huh	2369	A
you're right	2369	A
absolutely that's what happened to us we had a boat for several years in early marriage and along came the kids and it kind of sat there	2369	A
so we wound up selling it and it's been about uh i'd say eleven years uh since we got back into boating and then now they are big enough to	2369	A
you bet plus they can help now too they don't go along for the ride	2369	A
well i guess we've had our uh five minutes uh so we'll yeah- call this thing to a halt i appreciate talking to you Bill	2369	A
sure	2369	A
uh	2369	A
well i had only had the boat two years now uh most of the time we either go out to Lavon or uh we have been going up into Arkansas uh she her parents live up on Beaver Lake in northwest Arkansas real good it's uh	2369	A
dammed up the uh White River real pretty in Arkansas lake but we are hoping to explore a lot of the lakes around Texas and just stay close to home	2369	A
oh right yeah	2369	A
yeah	2369	A
yeah	2369	A
well i have heard a lot about Possum Kingdom	2369	A
oh yeah	2369	A
it's not over crowded	2369	A
yeah	2369	A
well that see that's one of my biggest gripes about Texoma as many times as we would go up there it's it's so rough	2369	A
that sounds	2369	A
oh no	2369	A
well that sounds like a good place to start out this spring i am looking forward to it	2369	A
all right thanks a lot Bill nice talking to you good bye	2369	A
community doing on recycling	2352	B
yeah sounds like an exciting one	2352	B
where- where do you live	2352	B
do they have the uh collection points where you can oh okay	2352	B
yes we're we're really behind the times here about all we've got is paper recycling and aluminum from cans uh North Carolina	2352	B
um i buy- i keep my newspapers and take those down and aluminum cans i keep those if i ever get them_1 i don't drink Cokes or anything like that so i don't don't usually get any aluminum cans	2352	B
but that's that's all they've got set up they've got a uh central collection point at the JC Park and uh that's it	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
yeah and you and you and- and you also get rid of it so	2352	B
oh yeah yeah that's why i just let it sit there and let it uh let it uh rot away and it's a good fertilizer	2352	B
oh that's right	2352	B
surprised you even have grass there	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
uh	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
yeah	2352	B
exactly	2352	B
hum	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
hum	2352	B
yeah i've seen i've seen pictures of uh seals that have gotten uh gotten their necks stuck in those uh plastic uh	2352	B
oh what do you call them_1 they hold six packs together those plastic-	2352	B
yeah because_1 they they're they're playful and they think this is fun we'll stick our head through here and they get their head stuck in there and they can't get out and they strangle	2352	B
and i	2352	B
or they starve because_1 they can't eat	2352	B
yeah i mean it's that's yeah that's that's terrible i mean i like seals	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
yeah	2352	B
yeah that's what it bothers me the same thing about uh netting tuna they they get so many dolphins	2352	B
and	2352	B
and i	2352	B
well they keep saying that but i'll tell you i i saw a program not too many months ago	2352	B
i think it was on Arts and Entertainment or Discovery one of the two and they're talking about all these people who are making uh all these boast that you know we're dolphin free and all that kind of stuff and they just they showed them_1 to be absolute liars	2352	B
yeah because you know people like Starkist they don't go out there and catch the fish they buy the fish from other people	2352	B
and and and all these people do is tell them oh no no no no we have we have these safety nets now	2352	B
sure	2352	B
that's right trust us	2352	B
yeah they had some they had some uh	2352	B
uh undercover film of these people and they they netted oh i mean dozens of dolphins	2352	B
and they killed probably half of them_1	2352	B
yeah it is i like dolphins too	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
um right right	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
well i think what they need to do is to come up with a better way of shrimp farming	2352	B
i mean there's- there's i- i don't see any reason why they can't uh i mean there's a lot of places Japan for instance have shrimp farms i mean they they they raise shrimp	2352	B
just- just like they raise anything else and and you can do it and the uh the the collection is very easy	2352	B
and you don't go around killing everything else that happens to be in the area	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
yeah	2352	B
right- right	2352	B
on fishing yeah	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
yeah well it's	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
yeah	2352	B
yeah and	2352	B
yeah is right yeah they're they're they're in it for a matter of survival not	2352	B
not environmentalist	2352	B
oh yeah they they probably are i	2352	B
of course i don't understand why they don't if they're going to kill them_1 they might as well eat the turtles too and	2352	B
they probably do i mean	2352	B
oh turtle is good	2352	B
yeah	2352	B
yeah	2352	B
yeah i had turtle when i was in Vietnam didn't know it was turtle at the time because_1 i wouldn't have eaten it but	2352	B
yeah i	2352	B
yeah that's true	2352	B
well hopefully it's real turtle too	2352	B
yeah you well that's that's the other thing i mean you never know what they're putting in there you know oh this is turtle soup you know okay	2352	B
sure right	2352	B
yeah why not give it a fancy name and put a high price tag on it	2352	B
it's probably it's probably Campbells or something	2352	B
no i i no- no i don't think we will because_1 you need- you need some kind of organization for it and	2352	B
yeah and the problem- the problem i mean we've got all these environmental organizations but they're all pulling in different directions and it's the the end results is is just a nullity nobody's getting anything done	2352	B
and and i think there needs to be a concerted effort you know say okay here's a problem we're going to do this and you put all your resources here and we're going to do this and you put your resources here something like that i mean just	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
yeah well that's what- that's what i mean about all these groups they're so	2352	B
yeah they're so uh	2352	B
they	2352	B
yeah i mean would- i mean you'd ideally they would all combine together and pool there resources and and	2352	B
and then they could have their agenda for all these different problems and come up with solutions but i mean you know work at it as an organization not as a little group	2352	B
just- they just don't get anywhere	2352	B
that's right that's right	2352	B
um-hum	2352	B
exactly	2352	B
yeah somebody to pull the whole thing together to make it work	2352	B
i mean we we've been at this for for so many years now and just- and just and nothing's happening	2352	B
the topic is how we can how-	2352	A
how what is our	2352	A
and how and do we have any ideas to encourage more recycling	2352	A
well it is to me uh because	2352	A
we're our particular little household is hot and heavy we have our glass bin our tin bin and uh our uh	2352	A
papers that we accumulate and recycle and	2352	A
Plano Texas	2352	A
yes they certainly do they certainly do	2352	A
where are you	2352	A
oh i see	2352	A
well our libraries and then the uh Wal-Mart stores have the bins in back of them_1 and when you recycle glass	2352	A
that seems to make a lot of difference and you have the colored glass and the clear glass and the paper and the tin cans	2352	A
so when you get all of that going it is it it occupies a space in your garage but you very quickly get use to it and we do not	2352	A
sure well you know we haul it off it- once in a while and we also do not bag our clippings on our lawns we let the wind blow it off we do not fill	2352	A
well this is Texas it doesn't set it blows	2352	A
give	2352	A
lots of grass give it twenty four hours and the whole things gone there's no problem someone else is worrying about	2352	A
and we have somebody else's but uh the problem that bothers me more uh you know i think the communities will do as good as they are supported by their local government you know	2352	A
if there's if there's enough need and they have a responsive local city management	2352	A
it will happen	2352	A
what upsets me uh there was an article and i'm sorry i was reading a book at the same time it was on our Texas beaches	2352	A
and they are saying- our Texas beaches are suppose to be the dirtiest beaches in the United States	2352	A
and it's not because of litter it's because of boats	2352	A
the if you could think of the basin the Texas gulf coast as a large swirling	2352	A
vacuum things that are thrown from ships swirl in and swirl in to our beaches	2352	A
and it kills some of our animals	2352	A
there's there's a professor down there that has Texas A and M has a nice size facility	2352	A
at Port Aransas	2352	A
and he's got all these collection of animals that he's frozen that were killed you know by plastic	2352	A
it's horrible it's a gross collection	2352	A
um-hum	2352	A
yes whatever those things- nasty things are	2352	A
that's right or they starve to death because they can't swallow	2352	A
or drowned	2352	A
yeah	2352	A
terrific	2352	A
well they showed one baby turtle that had been caught up in some uh plastic	2352	A
and it starved to death it couldn't it couldn't swallow it was pitiful	2352	A
well they're suppose to have- be working towards- around that	2352	A
uh-huh	2352	A
oh really	2352	A
sure so	2352	A
trust us it's our nets everything's great go back sleep and don't worry	2352	A
oh	2352	A
oh that's just sickening	2352	A
well and the other thing uh we have an endangered species turtle a Ridley's turtle	2352	A
that's on the Texas Gulf Coast	2352	A
and there's our shrimp nets are suppose to be turtle proof so the turtles can swim through	2352	A
huge fight going on	2352	A
uh the shrimpers just say great you want us to put a big hole in our nets is that what you want us to do this makes sense to us we're starving to death anyway and you want us to put a hole in our nets i can see their point	2352	A
i i guess if my family were terribly hungry i wouldn't be as humanistic as i am because i don't have that problem	2352	A
so it's it's really a hard hard issue to say what's right and what's not	2352	A
oh this is	2352	A
like they raise catfish now	2352	A
well part of the problem there is so many of the fishermen work for so little money	2352	A
we have a lot of Vietnamese	2352	A
fisher people	2352	A
and yet- they support their whole family on less than than i'd had for lunch	2352	A
anyway	2352	A
and of course they don't have the money to make an investment like that	2352	A
and it it all goes back to the government spending enough money high enough priorities on things like that	2352	A
that they it would have to be government owned or supported- financed if not controlled	2352	A
there because the financing simply isn't there	2352	A
because it's one of those cottage industries that uh	2352	A
the very poor keep going but can't do anything to change	2352	A
sure	2352	A
well and you know they could they could be terribly sorry they're killing the turtles you know	2352	A
probably are probably are	2352	A
well they may do it	2352	A
whether they like it or not they may do it you know	2352	A
yeah- that's correct turtle is very good that's the other thing wrong with the poor turtles	2352	A
well in my unreformed days i have had turtle soup in New Orleans and i can tell you it's fabulous	2352	A
but of course a boot would taste fabulous when they finish with it	2352	A
so it's no telling what the turtle really taste like	2352	A
well it maybe it wasn't you know who who knows what i had but it was fabulous	2352	A
great sure it is	2352	A
charge fifteen keep moving	2352	A
as long as it's French	2352	A
oh dear well i don't have any my big solutions all go back to elect politicians that are more sensitive because i think we can't do it ourselves	2352	A
you need clout	2352	A
it'd be great but the problem with that is you have all of these little branches off the main problem and everyone is very concerned about one thing	2352	A
you know like the woman down the tip of Texas that that	2352	A
calls her turtles and kisses everyone of them_1 everyday she's terribly interested in her turtles she could care less about shrimp	2352	A
and on she goes you just kind of think everybody's got such a splintered interest	2352	A
yeah that's exactly it	2352	A
and there's no way to to to make one group more interested or sensitive to the other group but they can be but they're not sensitive on the bottom line which means money	2352	A
that's why i keep going back to the politicians that it has to have some focal spot	2352	A
we we need uh we need an environmental Ralph Nader type	2352	A
which	2352	A
gee	2352	A
right	2352	A
the taxes tend to uh keep going up but	2341	A
uh i don't know if it helps me any to look at some of the other countries and say well there's always someone that's that's worse off in what they end up paying	2341	A
but uh go ahead	2341	A
yeah i'm still still i'm able to survive and	2341	A
and uh working for a company that reaps some benefits from the tax money it's almost like you're paying your own salary i don't work directly for the government but uh getting government contracts and	2341	A
being in the defense industry as it were even realize a little slim these days it's still uh	2341	A
still a feeling of you know it's not totally wasted dollars if you think about it some of it coming back your way	2341	A
uh that helps the rationale any but it's still angering to see the abuses uh even though they're uh	2341	A
a relatively small percentage they still they sound humongous when they're you know you hear millions and sometimes billions of dollars spent and	2341	A
and even some of the arguments over the national endowment for the arts and what's happening in that area it's still a pretty small chunk considering what actually flows through that government	2341	A
so but those are the things that get us going or get us stirred up sometimes	2341	A
people	2341	A
desire that that money not be spent well	2341	A
no no Texas doesn't have a state income tax yet that's	2341	A
well by the time the city gets involved i'm not sure how many how many people have their hand in it but we pay eight and a quarter cent	2341	A
so it's it's pretty pretty much but i think it's divvied up pretty much too uh the county gets some the city gets some and the state gets some	2341	A
and it's it's quite a bit i think six something is the state and and uh the rest of the pie goes elsewhere	2341	A
but we're in a particular part of the state that's pretty well off so it's it's like we get a lot of that back as far as local taxation goes	2341	A
yeah we have a real good you know police department and real good uh city services and boy the parks are all over the place and there's a lot of	2341	A
lot of money spent on us but uh the poor rural folks uh barely can get ambulance service and everything else so it's	2341	A
it's a real mixed blessing i guess to	2341	A
yeah it'd be nice if you could find someone	2341	A
oh	2341	A
uninfluenced by groups and and honest enough to find a way that would go over and then you'd have to find a way to make it work	2341	A
yeah yeah	2341	A
the uh bureaucracy seems to spend	2341	A
more money just trying to administer some of these programs than the programs are worth uh it seems uh	2341	A
an awful waste of time to have so many people having to fill out so much paper just to get rid of so few dollars in some of these cases	2341	A
so it make	2341	A
yeah	2341	A
and so much of that red tape was was initially and is added on	2341	A
to try and stop a given abuse you know you discover a particular problem and say well we ought to run this extra check and we'll have to file these extra papers to say well you you deserve this welfare or whatever	2341	A
and they just keep trying to to	2341	A
close all the loopholes and stop the abuse and all they're doing is making it worse and having to add more staff and	2341	A
and uh decreasing the efficiency of those who are actually trying to stop the abuse	2341	A
um-hum	2341	A
right	2341	A
it does seem to be the case	2341	A
i don't know whether it's worth and the economy has gone pretty well for a	2341	A
hundred years or so with the government doing what they do with taxes steering investments and steering virtually every	2341	A
dollar you make or spend it gets uh	2341	A
steered one way or the other based on tax breaks you get and you know housing had tax breaks for a while and then they slacked off on that for a while and then	2341	A
just uh generally wanting to be in control of of where everything's going for the most part give you the best break if you go their direction	2341	A
i don't know what what would happen if we	2341	A
uh got rid of some of those controls and just went to what some people would say would be simpler of just having uh you spend this much	2341	A
uh therefore you should be taxed this much uh that would only encourage saving it's not a	2341	A
you know a tax your income because now you're talking about having to report it and all that kind of stuff	2341	A
but if you put the burden on	2341	A
the retailer who really doesn't care if you you know buy your groceries and the like he doesn't care who bought the groceries you're going to pay the tax on it	2341	A
so most people tend to spend what they make anyway in in our income- income brackets	2341	A
so you know those fifty thousand dollars or the thirty thousand dollars would	2341	A
pretty much spend the majority of it and what they didn't save they wouldn't have to get or what they could- could save they wouldn't get taxed on	2341	A
yeah but you wouldn't be able to steer people toward	2341	A
a particular type of savings you wouldn't be able to say well you get better tax bonds if you you know	2341	A
avoid the capital gains tax and if you do it this way do this and you roll over your IRA's and all that they	2341	A
you wouldn't be able to steer people toward retirement and all that but boy if you save that much money	2341	A
and it didn't have the taxation problem well you might	2341	A
might do all right i don't know it seems	2341	A
yeah	2341	A
that's for sure	2341	A
right	2341	A
that's true plus what what there will be of it even if it's there isn't quite enough anyway so	2341	A
you're looking at having to do it on your own for the most part and then hope what you did didn't go away	2341	A
yeah the uh	2341	A
the taxes are are	2341	A
kind of messed up i guess with the abuses and the things we've written into it but uh looking- looking at some of the other countries and some of the other options you have in the world there	2341	A
it's not all that pleasant anywhere	2341	A
yeah pretty much	2341	A
well i hear one of my {kiddos} doing something they shouldn't be so i'll uh let you go and maybe-	2341	A
maybe- maybe we'll catch each other again	2341	A
i'll try bye	2341	A
i think i think we're always convinced that we're paying too much in taxes	2341	B
without getting back necessarily everything we'd like to but so far	2341	B
i don't think i've paid enough taxes to be too too awfully concerned about it yet	2341	B
yes	2341	B
right	2341	B
right	2341	B
do you all pay state income tax	2341	B
neither do we and and and i agree with the yet part they've just started talking about introducing a state income tax	2341	B
and right now we pay an extremely high state uh sales tax almost eight percent	2341	B
wow	2341	B
right	2341	B
well that's good	2341	B
that's i think that's the biggest problem i have with the tax system is there there is such a disparity between between really the haves and the have nots	2341	B
and i- i think the things that they use as a basis for distributing back the tax dollars needs to be looked at again	2341	B
i know that would be a a definite B V R M I R	2341	B
i think a lot a lot of times it seems like the classic can't see the forest for the trees i- i wonder if if they realize	2341	B
the the magnitude of some of the red tape you have to go through	2341	B
and i don't i don't think they're getting their money's worth and i- i- i definitely don't think that the added	2341	B
steps are are getting the benefit that they would like them to i think it's just causing most everyone else more problems because if somebody wants to get around the tax laws	2341	B
they will find a way	2341	B
if they want to badly enough they'll either find it themselves or they'll find someone to do it for them	2341	B
right	2341	B
right	2341	B
and that makes sense but like you said i mean it it seems simple and i think in a way it's so simple that people would be afraid to try it	2341	B
yeah	2341	B
yeah even if you didn't invest in necessarily the the best thing you would have so much more to invest	2341	B
you- you'd still be ahead	2341	B
and that's something that's something i need to- to learn a lot more about is is	2341	B
under the current structure what is the best thing to be investing in for the future	2341	B
because that's a that's a scary thought you always hear that Social Security won't be around by the time	2341	B
we're sixty three or sixty five and and need it and that's a scary thought	2341	B
no	2341	B
we still look pretty good don't we	2341	B
okay	2341	B
it's been nice talking to you	2341	B
okay have a good evening	2341	B
thanks bye-bye	2341	B
hi	2338	A
oh me i'm in favor of it	2338	A
yeah i thought i think if uh	2338	A
people like Charles Manson	2338	A
the the heinous crimes uh even if it's one time offense	2338	A
yeah	2338	A
yeah well i know that that- um	2338	A
like they can hold it off for years by uh i'm trying to think of the word that you were um retrials and um	2338	A
i'm forget- i cannot think of that word	2338	A
you have to make sure they're guilty	2338	A
yeah	2338	A
uh-huh	2338	A
yeah- well i think it's all uh i don't think they have uh execution here	2338	A
i i do know though it's easy to get put in jail for life	2338	A
TV station	2338	A
yeah he's they're wanting to record a gas chamber	2338	A
well it might scare some people off of doing the crimes	2338	A
you know	2338	A
yeah i yeah i agree with you there too	2338	A
yeah well i'll agree with you there i don't agree with them showing it on television hard telling who would see it	2338	A
but i i do think that it would scare some people from doing things- you know they'll think about this and say hey i don't think so	2338	A
yeah	2338	A
yeah	2338	A
yeah that's	2338	A
i don't think it's the kind of thing for anybody i know i wouldn't be able to watch it	2338	A
and i'm i'm supposed to be an adult	2338	A
yeah well there's more wrong people that would see it than right people	2338	A
uh you know uh	2338	A
but i i i don't know i think i would	2338	A
say that if they put it where those first time offenders of uh your sex crimes and murderers uh show them what would happen	2338	A
now my aunt had a uh thing when i was younger and uh you know i was working with her	2338	A
and she would say that they should uh	2338	A
for men who did sex crimes they should take off a piece of his body and the most important part to a man and inch by inch	2338	A
that would stop them from wanting to	2338	A
no well i thought it was funny listening to her she's just a she's she's a little bit uh dingy when it comes to things but well she's vicious	2338	A
yeah like that Lionel something or another that black boy of they had a television program about him two hour movie	2338	A
can't think of his name	2338	A
but he spent quite a few- few quite a while in jail	2338	A
yeah	2338	A
well you see that on television also	2338	A
yeah that's a problem with capital punishment though but- when you got people that you know uh for some reason or another Charles Manson sticks in my brain	2338	A
i seen him on an interview talking about how if he ever got out how many people he was going to kill	2338	A
and uh	2338	A
that's a man that should be put to death	2338	A
yeah	2338	A
that's more than some of the people out here who are out and out honest	2338	A
i uh i don't think anyone would miss him either	2338	A
yeah	2338	A
well as you can tell my two decided to come in here uh	2338	A
what	2338	A
i'm in Denison	2338	A
yeah i got some guy from San Francisco one night	2338	A
uh no you is talking about Saddam Hussein	2338	A
i think it would be wrong for us to kill him for the Americans to kill him	2338	A
i think the	2338	A
now if one of the Kurds uh i'm sure you know who they are	2338	A
if they went in and got him he wouldn't be a what's the word martyr martyr martyr martyr	2338	A
i could see the word in my head i just couldn't pronounce it	2338	A
uh but if we did it oh man	2338	A
they'd have him up on a pedestal	2338	A
yeah that's what my husband keeps telling me see how you know um i'm just now getting into the world politics and all that	2338	A
uh i guess i just too young to understand this or something	2338	A
uh but uh	2338	A
yeah well it's getting easier to understand though you know plus my husband he was in the Navy for ten years so he uh when it comes to the military he kind of knows what he's talking about	2338	A
i don't put every a hundred percent stock into what he says but	2338	A
i'll listen and agree with what i think sounds right	2338	A
yeah well i think they uh	2338	A
the people there will take care of him now	2338	A
right	2338	B
you are	2338	B
right	2338	B
yeah the the i mean people like that are crazy i i did a study on it though when i was in high school it was one of these things	2338	B
we had to pick a topic to to investigate	2338	B
and uh at that time i don't think it's like that any more but at that time uh it was very unfair capital punishment was a lot more common	2338	B
and if you tended- and it tended to be that if you were ignorant or if you were a foreigner or if you were black or any minority for that matter	2338	B
the chances your chances of of uh getting the death penalty were you know like hundreds of times greater than if you could just communicate well	2338	B
i mean you didn't have to be um you didn't even necessarily have to be white but if you could just communicate and you could come across in the court room with some kind of um	2338	B
you know sense about you then even if you did the exact same crime chances are you wouldn't get you'd get life instead of the death penalty as a opposed to somebody who couldn't communicate well	2338	B
and at that time it just seemed so fair- unfair	2338	B
that um i i felt like i couldn't uh um	2338	B
you know i just didn't agree with it	2338	B
it's gotten so though that there are so many	2338	B
you know there are so many uh	2338	B
right	2338	B
right	2338	B
right uh i know what you're saying um	2338	B
but yeah they there's you know there's always uh uh you know and and in a way you know i guess that's good i mean if you're going to if you're going to kill somebody	2338	B
right yeah you know give them give them i mean you should give somebody every every chance even even if it seems obvious	2338	B
um i don't know what the what the law is like in Texas i mean i certainly haven't heard anything- any anything about somebody being executed or anything	2338	B
i don't i don't either	2338	B
yeah	2338	B
well you know the um there was something on TV last night about how one state what there was a newspaper in no it was a TV station	2338	B
you- did you see that	2338	B
i thought that was disgusting i mean	2338	B
well yeah but you know there there are so many people who just get get their jollies off of watching that	2338	B
and that's what that's what really bothers me you know i'm all for deterrents	2338	B
but i i think what's going to happen is it's going to turn it into a circus	2338	B
and	2338	B
no	2338	B
right	2338	B
sure	2338	B
you know what what you know what might happen but the- you know for TV station- you know that TV station isn't going to want to restrict how they use it	2338	B
and they're going to show it on the six o'clock- well probably not the six o'clock news but they'll show it on the eleven o'clock eleven o'clock news	2338	B
and i don't you know i've got a ten year old and	2338	B
you know she's she could very well be up at that time	2338	B
you know when we're and that's just not the kind of thing for a ten year old i'm not sure it's the kind of thing for a sixteen year old	2338	B
right	2338	B
right	2338	B
right and in fact i think it'd be harmful if my if you know if my daughter or my any of my kids saw it	2338	B
so that has to be brought into the picture too	2338	B
you know you just can't blatantly say let's let's show it and and the the right people will see it and it'll deter them from committing a crime all lot of the wrong people are going to see it too and uh	2338	B
yeah yeah	2338	B
right	2338	B
yeah	2338	B
right	2338	B
yeah my wife says that all the time	2338	B
yeah well that that would certainly do it	2338	B
yeah well you know i i think that if if i felt like the the the system was was truly fair and and uh and that they would never make a mistake then	2338	B
you know but you hear you know you hear about people who are who are genuinely uh mistakenly accused of a crime and	2338	B
yeah	2338	B
i can't i can't think either-	2338	B
yeah right	2338	B
that's right and and it turns out he didn't do it	2338	B
or you know and and it's easy you know and and you know let's face it not all policemen are honest and	2338	B
that's right	2338	B
and and you know they can they'll take somebody who maybe is mentally retarded and and then it's and they're under pressure to to solve a crime	2338	B
and some and the circumstances uh may be molded to blame somebody who didn't do it and especially if it's you know somebody who's mentally retarded who can't defend themselves very well	2338	B
and i'd hate to see them get the ultimate punishment and it turns out it wasn't them	2338	B
right	2338	B
yeah yeah well he was a	2338	B
yeah sheesh	2338	B
and uh it it it just doesn't seem right that our tax money or somebody's tax money goes to keep him alive	2338	B
you know he gets three meals a day and and he probably	2338	B
right right that's right and he's probably living a lot better than some people who deserve a lot more	2338	B
and uh that does you know that does sort of you know but how you know it's just so hard it's just so hard to to be fair and uh	2338	B
yeah i guess i wouldn't i wouldn't mind if if all of a sudden he didn't exist any more uh	2338	B
no no uh i you know i i think the same thing about people like Saddam Hussein	2338	B
you know you know the- jeez you know they're just they're just the scum of the earth	2338	B
and uh i just hate the idea that my tax money might go to support somebody like that	2338	B
now where where where area where are you from	2338	B
Denison oh okay	2338	B
and every so often you get somebody who's in in uh California or or New York something-	2338	B
yeah yeah	2338	B
yeah	2338	B
i think you're right i don't think we're i think we're we'd we'd overstep our bounds if we went in and did that	2338	B
though it's awfully tempting	2338	B
yep	2338	B
martyr	2338	B
yeah	2338	B
yeah	2338	B
oh yeah the whole	2338	B
well right now we're in a delicate situation because we've got this	2338	B
we've- for the first time we're sort of aligned with a lot of these Arab countries	2338	B
yeah	2338	B
oh sure	2338	B
it's complicated	2338	B
oh	2338	B
right	2338	B
right	2338	B
right	2338	B
yeah there and you know it's a he's got that delicate balance right there and we'd just be overstepping our bounds i think if we walked in and sort of took over	2338	B
yeah i just can't imagine that they'd let him rule any longer you know if if they had you know if they could do something about it	2338	B
i mean his own army is going to eventually turn on him because and and you see- this has happened before in history you know that it just gets to a certain point where you're just not willing	2338	B
hi	2365	A
you didn't try we {rewallpapering} you just uh	2365	A
did you use a textured paint or	2365	A
um	2365	A
well did you get good results	2365	A
yeah	2365	A
but just didn't it didn't it didn't cover it	2365	A
well we did a uh	2365	A
we moved oh last August and we're getting a house my house had this dark wood paneling at the end of the den and we decided we went to i've forgotten one of the paint stores and they just said oh you can get by and i forgotten what it was you put down	2365	A
and then you can just paint right over the dark	2365	A
well more or less after about uh half dozen coats it looks reasonable but it kept the the dark it was uh just a real dark uh wood grain type paneling	2365	A
and uh it was smooth and uh and we would we put this stuff on and and it supposedly textured it or or did something to it and	2365	A
but because of the the- dark behind it was really really hard to cover	2365	A
and	2365	A
yeah it was something like that although we sort of when we got through i wished we hadn't done it because we were you know we were trying to make the house look nice to sell it and we were painting it and trying to do uh you know make it and it it really was	2365	A
you know the advice they give you is uh the job was considerably tougher than we thought	2365	A
uh particularly when you try to i was talking to somebody else who who had a lot of wood paneling and	2365	A
uh they had gotten somebody to come in with an estimate and it seemed like there was it was a good sized den with a lot paneling and the people quoted thirty thousand dollars to paint it or something	2365	A
have you have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to have something painted	2365	A
yeah	2365	A
yeah	2365	A
oh that's quite reasonable	2365	A
um	2365	A
the problem is have you have you tried matching paint lately	2365	A
my wife we we built a shed over the long way actually it took this is not on the topic but i did finish it but my wife went to the uh Home Depot i think it was and and took a uh a copy of took a piece of brick	2365	A
and she wanted to paint the shed it's a it's a wooden shed uh and she took it and they've got this machine that matches the color of paint	2365	A
and uh they got and uh and in fact she put some right back- she got they mixed uh a gallon of it and uh it's just remarkable how close it will match the paint	2365	A
uh and it does it uh oh electronically some something magic	2365	A
yeah you know they it but it's electronic	2365	A
uh you put your sample under this thing and it looks at it and and uh and determines the	2365	A
and it it's really remarkable uh the problem they had and then they wanted some gray to do the to do the trim	2365	A
and uh but they didn't didn't occur to them that um that they could have taken a sample	2365	A
um from i forgotten this is Sherwin Williams Paint or something but anyway it's it's remarkable that's one of the problems though when you start painting to try to get the	2365	A
you know you want this you want this to look like this and you want that to look like that and of course if it's all white you're all right but when you start getting into colors have you had problems getting colors to match	2365	A
um	2365	A
so	2365	A
gosh	2365	A
so you so what's your what's the solution then	2365	A
oh my	2365	A
well at least you'll get very good at it right	2365	A
you could go back and and paint the whole thing over that's uh this is an interesting topic that they would bring up painting because it uh it seems like everybody has a you know to go in and do i'll just do a little bit here and a little that	2365	A
although the uh it's uh it we almost one day we we painted the house to uh we painted we painted the whole inside	2365	A
and it had all this dark trim we thought uh you know we did the one wall but the other trim i'm trying to think i think i think we left most of it because it gets to be uh they don't do that in the newer houses now we don't uh the mold everything is white in a new house everything is white	2365	A
oh good luck we wound up selling the house actually i i don't know whether it made actually it does it's interesting that the white um	2365	A
makes the rooms look bigger one of the in our down stairs in our dining room we have a formal dining room it has molding uh like picture frames i don't know what you call that that actually that are along the walls that you know up a couple of feet	2365	A
and my wife painted those the insides of those dark blue	2365	A
and uh	2365	A
it makes the room look remarkably smaller	2365	A
the trim is still white	2365	A
the the molding but by and she did that all the way around the room which makes it look very attractive but it makes the room look smaller which is uh	2365	A
uh which is it explains why they why they have everything white but i you wouldn't think that i well	2365	A
maybe maybe somebody that understands colors would know all of that stuff but	2365	A
uh not particularly because the house has so many windows uh it has the the the living room has four uh good size windows	2365	A
and uh well of course at night but with the	2365	A
we have we have we have a soccer field that's um oh about a hundred yards from our house	2365	A
and the lights shine right at our house it's kind of	2365	A
we didn't know that when we bought the house but	2365	A
yeah we have a lot of light yeah and well it it it um well it's just uh i think it's just the the the dark blue to about three feet and then above that we left it white so	2365	A
anyway it didn't it didn't change but the the interesting thing is that paint we wound up having to go back and and scrape some of that away it didn't it kind of bled under the masking tape which i guess is probably the topic we're	2365	A
we're really on to that that the masking is you have to do that very very carefully	2365	A
that's right you can work yourself to death well i'm sorry to hear your color didn't come out so good over the weekend	2365	A
it's kind of frustrating	2365	A
well i've got to go to a meeting it's been good talking to you	2365	A
okay good-bye	2365	A
hi	2365	B
uh as a matter of fact this past weekend since we had a long weekend i uh took on a painting project in my bathroom	2365	B
and i had wallpaper up	2365	B
i had to completely strip the wallpaper off and then spackle holes and then paint that and it took me all weekend because uh the wallpaper getting it off i had to wet the walls down and that had to dry	2365	B
and then the spackling had to dry a day and then the painting took another day	2365	B
no i i just painted	2365	B
uh no actually the wall behind the paper was smooth so i just used a like a semigloss	2365	B
and	2365	B
well no not really i need to it it looks so bad our you can see where those spackling marks were i need to uh either paper back over it or do something	2365	B
yeah it covered the spots pretty good but it didn't excuse me it didn't uh	2365	B
uh it just didn't look as smooth as i wanted it to	2365	B
uh-huh	2365	B
uh-huh	2365	B
was it like a primer	2365	B
would you put a huh uh-huh	2365	B
yeah	2365	B
oh my goodness that's an awful lot	2365	B
not inside now uh when we bought the house that we live in right now we had a company that came out and painted it that was one of the requirements from you know FHA	2365	B
that the house be painted before we bought it and it was fairly reasonable we have a brick house but all the trim	2365	B
around the house was uh if i remember right it was like uh five hundred dollars	2365	B
yeah yeah	2365	B
so that wasn't too bad	2365	B
no i haven't	2365	B
uh-huh	2365	B
uh-huh	2365	B
oh so they did do a good job	2365	B
yeah	2365	B
uh-huh	2365	B
uh-huh	2365	B
uh-huh	2365	B
yeah yeah as a matter of fact uh what we've got ours painted now is kind of a light creamy color and a uh	2365	B
a blue and the blue even so many years two years later or so it doesn't match	2365	B
you know	2365	B
the very same type of paint and everything	2365	B
so	2365	B
oh i have no idea i repainted the whole thing	2365	B
yeah	2365	B
yeah	2365	B
yeah	2365	B
yeah that's right	2365	B
white yeah that's what we're trying to get ours to look like	2365	B
yeah	2365	B
uh-huh	2365	B
uh-huh	2365	B
oh i see	2365	B
huh she painted the insides dark blue and then the trim what color-	2365	B
okay white	2365	B
uh-huh	2365	B
yeah	2365	B
yeah	2365	B
yeah	2365	B
yeah	2365	B
well uh what about the lighting did it make a big difference	2365	B
oh uh-huh	2365	B
uh-huh	2365	B
so that uh you get some the color doesn't really matter for because you have that light	2365	B
all time oh	2365	B
I see	2365	B
uh-huh	2365	B
and it takes a long time	2365	B
yeah really no kidding	2365	B
it is a lot of work a lot of work	2365	B
nice talking to you thanks a lot bye	2365	B
have you had any uh major uh car repairs done recently	2398	A
uh-huh	2398	A
so you're saying that the repairs would have cost more than the car was worth	2398	A
i think any car that runs right now is in demand	2398	A
uh i work on my own i've got an nineteen eighty Trans Am that i've had uh since it was new	2398	A
and i've had very good luck with it uh haven't had many repairs done at all the alternator went out four years ago and uh the i had to replace the water pump back in nineteen eighty three	2398	A
but uh other than a few transmission leaks that i got repaired uh i really haven't had anything but uh regular maintenance	2398	A
yeah i change the oil and i do the lubrication	2398	A
but if any major problems say like uh transmission leaks i took it in for that	2398	A
and i had to have an alignment done last year so i had that done	2398	A
uh not really it's not too easy	2398	A
i had past uh state inspection uh just last month so	2398	A
and i had a turn signal out so i had to take it in to get the turn signal fixed but uh other than that for passing inspection uh they gave me a shopping list of things i needed to get done	2398	A
namely uh replacing- putting the catalytic converter back on the car	2398	A
and fixing the emergency brake	2398	A
so those things i could do myself it wasn't a problem	2398	A
Texas	2398	A
uh-huh	2398	A
i had that problem with a nineteen sixty eight Camaro	2398	A
i never did get it fixed	2398	A
it it could be the starter that it just gets too hot	2398	A
yeah	2398	A
hm	2398	A
yeah	2398	A
right they never do	2398	A
uh-huh	2398	A
i've heard of that problem with many other different cars doesn't seem to be prevalent with just one manufacturer	2398	A
i won't buy a Dodge	2398	A
my dad had one he had a Dodge	2398	A
six hundred and after thirty thousand miles the head gasket went out	2398	A
nothing but problems with it so he finally traded it in and actually bought a Ford Escort	2398	A
oh a lot of people do like Fords yeah	2398	A
sure	2398	A
yep	2398	A
i'm ready for a new car myself but i've had this car for eleven years and it's given me such little trouble that i i i don't think i could get an adequate replacement that would uh cause me to let- huh	2398	A
uh-huh	2398	A
i guess that's what about thirty forty thousand dollars	2398	A
right	2398	A
i guess not	2398	A
i have no idea i know they're they're engineered very well but i would have a hard time justifying spending that kind of money on any car	2398	A
uh-huh	2398	A
right	2398	A
no dealers will get- get you on the oil changes anyway i took my car in one time many years ago for an oil change at the dealer and they charged me thirty dollars for it	2398	A
they they gave me this cock and bull story that because there was a turbo charger on the car they had to prime the turbine with the oil	2398	A
and it's it's it's a bunch of hog wash i- i've changed the oil myself i've put a filter on you know put the oil in and all it's no problem at all	2398	A
no i have to get under my car to get the oil filter out but yeah you change it four times a year it's not that big a deal filter you can buy that on sale for two dollars uh the oil um less than a dollar- dollar- less than a dollar a dollar a quart it's really not that	2398	A
uh-huh	2398	A
right	2398	A
well i can get the filter off just by laying down underneath the car i can't crawl under it the clearance isn't enough but enough to reach under and get the filter off it's not a problem	2398	A
yeah	2398	A
uh-huh for anything else i'll put the car up on jack stands	2398	A
oh yeah	2398	A
when putting the catalytic converter back on i had to put the right side of the car up on jack stands	2398	A
but it wasn't a real problem	2398	A
yeah every three thousand miles i'll change the oil i've got about ninety four thousand miles on the car right now	2398	A
and uh its working just fine i don't have any problems at all so i'm going to keep it uh i get offers every now and then from	2398	A
from grocery store baggers that want to buy my car because it's a Trans Am they're high school seniors seventeen years old and they got to impress their girl friend	2398	A
the trouble is they think they can buy it for a thousand dollars or less	2398	A
yeah it's in great shape uh body is in excellent shape it just needs paint i need to look up some place to uh to get the car painted	2398	A
a new car	2398	A
oh i'm not- i don't think i'm in the new car market	2398	A
a new car that really hard pick	2398	A
well as a matter of fact i just got rid of a car because of the requirement to do some major repairs	2398	B
um i had a Ford Escort with about ninety five thousand miles on it and the engine was shot um	2398	B
i i think the problem was uh the head gasket needed to be replaced	2398	B
and um	2398	B
but nobody would do just the head gasket everybody wanted to overhaul the engine entirely	2398	B
right and um	2398	B
um	2398	B
i did get the water pump was shot at the same time so i got the water pump fixed just to carry me over until i could sell the car um	2398	B
which i which surprisingly the car was in great demand um in fact i had a bunch of people come to look at it and they were fighting over how much they were going to pay me for this piece of junk i was amazed	2398	B
i guess so um but- i ended up buying a um a used car to replace it i got a uh eighty five Dodge Aries which only had thirty four thousand miles on it	2398	B
and uh speaking of repair problems um this car has a has an interesting problem that nobody seems to be able to fix do do you fix cars	2398	B
wow	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
but do you do anything yourself i mean	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
okay	2398	B
right	2398	B
yeah yeah	2398	B
i don't think that's the kind of thing you can do yourself is it unless you had the equipment	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
oh	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
yeah what now what state are you in	2398	B
Texas you're in Texas so am i	2398	B
um yeah the the problem i have with this Dodge uh this Dodge Aries is that if i drive the car for reasonable period of time enough to get the car heated up	2398	B
and then i run to- run out to do a quick errand and jump back into the car it won't start	2398	B
and it won't start until the car is cooled off	2398	B
i've learned that	2398	B
and as soon as it cools- cools off it'll start right up	2398	B
what was the problem	2398	B
oh	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
yeah somebody said that um	2398	B
that uh there must- there's probably some kind of short in the starter	2398	B
and that when the car heats up it uh the metal expands to create the short	2398	B
and then it- it- it isn't until the car cools down that the metal you know these two pieces aren't touching any more and and uh and your you you know then it'll start because you don't have the short	2398	B
but i've taken it to a mechanic and and he started to look at it in fact i drove it out there and i said i bet you anything if you go try start the car right now you won't be able to start it sure enough he couldn't and they had to push it into the garage	2398	B
but they started uh tracing the wires back to see if they could find any shorts or anything and after they fiddled with the wires the problem didn't uh didn't recur- recur	2398	B
they couldn't get it to fail	2398	B
and sure enough after i'd taken it home for you know a couple of weeks after that i didn't have the problem	2398	B
but now it's starting to recur again	2398	B
so it's just one of those weird things i mean he was willing- he said well i think it's in the ignition switch it'll only cost you eighty five dollars but i won't guarantee that's the problem	2398	B
uh yeah and i'm going well- well- i don't want to gamble so i just let the car cool off until i get a hard failure	2398	B
and then uh	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
well that's that's that's reassuring i've never had a Dodge before	2398	B
and i mean it seems like a nice little car it's a great deal it only had thirty four thousand miles on it	2398	B
and otherwise it doesn't give me any problems at all	2398	B
you won't oh yeah	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
oh really Holy mackerel	2398	B
oh jeez	2398	B
i've you know i've actually had a lot of luck with Fords um um i'm not gonna i'm not gonna sit here and claim that they're the best cars in the world but	2398	B
yeah i mean this this Escort even when the head gasket went i mean it would start first time every time	2398	B
and uh	2398	B
uh so i've- i've just been real pleased and my step father happens to work at a Ford dealership and that makes things a little easier come car time but	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
i just uh i was just talking to somebody who'd had a some kind of i think he had a Cutlass	2398	B
and he had a hundred and ninety five thousand miles on it and finally- the thing finally went	2398	B
so he goes out and he buys a Lexus	2398	B
and i'm going whoa he he moved up	2398	B
yeah i mean you know he's single he's approaching fifty years old	2398	B
he doesn't really have anything else to spend his money on	2398	B
so but uh i can't- i just can't imagine i mean are those cars worth thirty or forty thousand dollars	2398	B
really	2398	B
well it's funny because talk about car repairs i was getting my oil changed and i was sitting in the little lobby it's one of these you know five minute change places	2398	B
and this guy comes storming into the lobby there and he says um	2398	B
you know you guys advertise a twenty dollar oil change and you charged me thirty dollars	2398	B
and the guy says well yeah but you got a Mercedes Benz and it takes a special oil filter	2398	B
and the guy was oh yeah he's almost proud that he had to pay an extra ten bucks to get his oil changed i'm going	2398	B
i don't think that's worth it i don't think spending an extra you know twenty thousand dollars for a car is worth it you know i don't know	2398	B
yeah oh yeah	2398	B
oh jeez	2398	B
what	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
yeah yeah	2398	B
i couldn't i tried to do that with my Escort but there's no way to change to get that oil filter out without that i could figure out without getting underneath the car	2398	B
ooh	2398	B
yeah yeah	2398	B
oh yeah i'd prefer to do it but the Escort was very difficult for me to get under and i didn't want to put it up on ramps or anything it just made me nervous	2398	B
i mean can you crawl underneath there or is it	2398	B
hum	2398	B
yeah i just couldn't yeah	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
i think this uh the the Dodge would be pretty easy to change the oil on i think	2398	B
at least i'm going to give it a try cause you can see- i mean the oil filters i mean you can touch it it's right there	2398	B
you've got jacks it makes me nervous	2398	B
whoa whoa	2398	B
yeah yeah hm	2398	B
well i i you know it's just a that's the biggest hassle	2398	B
i think that if i had been nicer to my Escort and been more diligent about getting the oil changes and doing that kind of stuff i could have probably gotten another ten thousand miles out of it	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
wow wow	2398	B
gee	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
all right	2398	B
right right	2398	B
well i bet you i bet i mean if it's in good condition and stuff you could probably get a pretty good blue book price	2398	B
well	2398	B
the paint- paint job yeah if you're going to look a new car what would you look at	2398	B
yeah	2398	B
well what what what brand i mean what model would you look	2398	B
no we don't	2300	B
no i just i- i make so much money here at TI that that we just spend it	2300	B
and we never have a problem meeting it from paycheck to paycheck it's pretty neat being that independently wealthy and working for a major semiconductor firm you can just spend it well	2300	B
i'm being facetious i'm being very comical uh we have a budget um that works well i kind of look at it for more of a we have a financial uh analyst a finance administrator i guess that that uh	2300	B
or i guess the financial planners the training now we've had it for about four years who got our businesses and and and our life in line how to manage credit cards how to put away say for you know money markets and this kind of thing	2300	B
and there's some freebies out there are you should put ten to fifteen percent of your monthly monthly bring home in some sort of savings account that being money market uh bonds coda mat savings uh	2300	B
or a listed liquid account and which which we do um you should always have three months of your salary in a savings account in case there's a major need for that	2300	B
okay you should always have an umbrella permit that bridges your uh life insurance and your medical and your um um car insurance in case you run into a lawyer and you break his arm he's going to sue the pants off of you	2300	B
these kind of things are about a hundred dollars a year so you- you know these are all equivalent to the monthly budget things some of them_1 are there to pacify situations and some of them_1 are there to prevent things from happening	2300	B
but uh i guess we kind of got away from about the last sixteen months as far as saying two hundred dollars for food and three hundred dollars for this and two hundred for that because we had a a child which is about a year old and then uh	2300	B
we've just been kind of	2300	B
working on i've been developing it but it's kind of hard diaper prices are going up you know and formula and stuff you know	2300	B
um-hum	2300	B
um-hum	2300	B
um-hum	2300	B
do you have your uh loans through the Texas Credit Union	2300	B
okay thing about the credit union is it's the way it's set up is if you have	2300	B
two thousand dollars left let's say on on the loan if you go up there and write them a two thousand dollar check it doesn't all go towards principal	2300	B
they take out for the for the finances the finance charge which is kind of you know so it's like one of these lose or swim type of credit one of those loans not really the best in the world but	2300	B
but you know they're- they're uh since your husband is is is um uh a TIer but doesn't have the loans with the credit union they're offering something that might be worth taking a gander at i don't know what your percent is on your on your car payments	2300	B
but they are they'll take any TI non credit union loan like if you have a fourteen percent loan for a new car they'll take it	2300	B
and refinance it and put it with Texas Credit Union at i think it's a ten and a quarter percent	2300	B
which is not a bad deal one of the secretaries we have down here is is paying twelve percent through GMAC or something	2300	B
and she's doing it i mean it's not like it's like	2300	B
i think they even cover that because they want you as a uh uh they want the TIer to be part of the credit union	2300	B
yeah	2300	B
well five years is not that uh you know five years is not that bad of a problem only because you're paying more interest but your um payments- your payments are lower	2300	B
oh really	2300	B
sure	2300	B
um-hum	2300	B
yes	2300	B
you save a lot	2300	B
if if if if and you need to be very careful	2300	B
if the loan is set up to have bimonthly- they call it a yuppie loan if it's set up for bimonthly payments if you because you'll save seventeen- fifteen to seventeen years off the end of the loan seven- i'm sorry seven to nine years off the end of the loan	2300	B
and there are there is a local firm that'll actually if if like in my situation i don't have that because the loan was not available	2300	B
i can have- this firm will pick up my loan for a six hundred fifty dollar fee so i can cut that much off the end of but i'm not interested because we're moving out of the house next year	2300	B
yeah but uh those are all great the the interesting thing we're getting ready to have a house built	2300	B
is it's not a lot of the firms that offer mortgage- mortgage loan firms aren't offering um that loan	2300	B
i mean you can ask and you can wheel and deal but it's not as open as it it should be it's a great idea hell i'd love to cut ours in half but uh man	2300	B
and if you figure get with a financial person and you can figure up exactly when like the eighteenth month of a loan if you make like a four hundred dollar payment	2300	B
over and above your house payment it'll make uh it has a magic with numbers it i it'll shave almost you know X number of dollars off	2300	B
um-hum	2300	B
sure	2300	B
somebody you trust uh you know there are so many rip-off artists here in this town it's it's and it's uh it's really a sin it really is	2300	B
i got taken on some firewood- on firewood	2300	B
i mean uh uh the guy shorted us a half a cord of firewood and my wife didn't know and i stopped payment on the check and he'd already been paid by a cashing firm and and they're suing us they're suing me on this and it's for a hundred and thirty four dollars	2300	B
absolutely pathetic	2300	B
oh okay well something- well probably something like -that did you call them_1 and tell them you just you just	2300	B
might be a good idea because_1 because_1 you're going to get what a a check uh	2300	B
okay so do you all keep a budget	2300	A
you don't	2300	A
well	2300	A
are you being smart or are you serious	2300	A
uh-huh	2300	A
uh-huh	2300	A
yeah	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
yeah	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
that's funny yeah we have a we're twenty eight and he's been working at TI for five years	2300	A
and that was pretty much his first really really major job of any you know professional because_1 he'd worked you know part time during school and what not and uh he was a little late graduating so we're	2300	A
you know uh and we have a nine and a half year old son and it's because_1 you know we were eighteen when we had him so we're we're kind of looking at this from the other aspect of	2300	A
we you know we have a lot for to be our age and you know just everything and having the responsibilities we've had on us for at such a young age you know we have a like a nice house people you know are really shocked at how nice everything is in our house	2300	A
but we don't you know live in a brand new house either maybe an eighty ninety hundred thousand dollar house we live in a thirty year old house that would probably sell for forty five thousand	2300	A
so you know we have trade-offs so we're more we have a monthly budget with this this this this but we have no savings which isn't real wise but	2300	A
we just we don't have the income at this time really to have any because_1 we have um three debts that we're trying to pay off from both of our student loans we're still paying trying to pay those off	2300	A
and we have one car payment that we're i think we have about thirteen months left on it	2300	A
and after that we either what we want to do is begin doubling up our car payment	2300	A
um they'll pay our car payment is equivalent to both of our student loans so what we want to do is next year keep driving the same cars	2300	A
and um pay on the student loans split that car payment in half and pay you know double up payments on both our loans and it'll work out perfect	2300	A
no we don't	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
um	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
really	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
oh really	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
does she have to pay to have it refinanced	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
TIer to	2300	A
see we got ripped off buying our new car we both come out of uh drugs and stuff and we became Christians about five years ago right when right when he got hired for TI right before he got hired for TI he'd uh gotten saved and stuff	2300	A
and so i mean when you get come out of drugs and stuff you have nothing i mean you know you don't have anything	2300	A
you have the clothes on your back and you might have a car and that kind of thing and so when he when he started working at TI we uh you know we really felt like God told us to buy a new car because he had an older car that was going to need to be fixed and high gas	2300	A
but we got ripped off on it because we wanted it financed at four years and we were young and we'd look about nineteen people still think we're about they ask us where we go to high school when we get our hair cut and stuff both of us	2300	A
and so it's just kind of strange you know so five years ago we probably looked like real ding dongs you know	2300	A
so we went in and they financed the car for five and we didn't know that we got kind of taken just a little bit so we're kind of upset that we're having to you know pay this fifth year on the car because it was just not a wise thing but we learned a good lesson so	2300	A
you know	2300	A
yeah but they they would have only been about twenty dollars a month higher	2300	A
and he want yeah he just told me this last week that he he said don't you remember i asked them to finance it at four years and they came back and they said that they had it figured for five and we'd already signed the papers	2300	A
and i maybe i might have been there i don't remember hearing that but i also wasn't the one in charge of it so i wasn't paying as close of attention	2300	A
but anyway instead of putting our foot down about it we just went okay whatever you know so anyway so next time we'll do that different we want to next time pay cash for our car too we want to pay cash for everything we can possibly do when we buy a house	2300	A
we attended a Bill Guathier financial seminar and he has a lot of wisdom on that just on Biblical you know principles to finance he runs a big the largest real estate company in Fort Worth debt free	2300	A
and we really believe in debt free living and debt free car buying and debt free house buying and if we do take out a loan on a house in the future what we'll do is pay twice a twice a month on it and because you save a lot in interest just doing that	2300	A
and then	2300	A
right	2300	A
right	2300	A
right	2300	A
right	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
oh really	2300	A
uh-huh	2300	A
uh-huh	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
yeah	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
yeah	2300	A
um-hum	2300	A
right yeah we real we've become aware of that we have a there's a loan officer through our church too that i think could help us better you know he does that full time with the bank you know	2300	A
and so we're going to use people that we're in a relationship with that we know that you know we know are people of integrity so	2300	A
you know that is another thing that you know we feel like our long term goal is going to be benefitted by next time we buy a car we're not just going to go to Toyota of Irving you know we're going to go to somebody that we know we're going to take someone with us older and we didn't do any of those things	2300	A
yeah	2300	A
really	2300	A
oh my	2300	A
i stopped payment on a check oh that's funny	2300	A
oh this last week we bought a sewing machine at Zak's and then i found that you could get the same machine better for less locally not much less but it was enough less and i found they locally serviced it	2300	A
and we just stopped payment on the check so i hope they don't sue us over it but we never received any merchandise either so i don't think it would hold any	2300	A
anyway	2300	A
no we didn't even call them we just did it maybe my husband should call today	2300	A
um casual ones but with class you know not too fancy but uh i i won't go to a fast food place	2367	A
i really can't stand those uh	2367	A
um	2367	A
quality of the food	2367	A
yeah	2367	A
yeah	2367	A
you had a good time there	2367	A
yeah	2367	A
uh-huh	2367	A
okay	2367	A
um	2367	A
yeah	2367	A
yeah	2367	A
yeah	2367	A
yeah that's true	2367	A
there's some places though that i go to because i like the food there and i kind of they don't have the best service or they're not the friendliest but i'll i'll tolerate it just because i know that's the kind of food i want to eat	2367	A
and there's other places but like you said the the food doesn't matter it's you have such a good time there	2367	A
yeah i have not in not in a good while but	2367	A
just to see the show just to see the show right	2367	A
uh-huh	2367	A
um	2367	A
um	2367	A
yeah that sounds pretty wild	2367	A
yeah	2367	A
predictable yeah	2367	A
yeah that does sound like a pretty neat idea	2367	A
well there's this uh there's this type kind of restaurant called a brew pub are you familiar with those	2367	A
where they they brew their own beer there	2367	A
yeah and there's i used to live in Colorado and there was a lot of them there and there's actually there's two in the Raleigh area	2367	A
and uh i'm a i'm a home brewer myself so i just am envious of these people and you go there and a couple you have gone to you can order like a sampler	2367	A
and and while you're eating your meal and usually their food is good too they they bring out six different kinds of beer that they brewed on the premises and you just test it's like uh beer tasting thing while you're eating your meal and it's really neat	2367	A
um	2367	A
yeah i usually don't go somewhere that's too far away	2367	A
but uh	2367	A
yeah	2367	A
yeah well i guess for like lunch places that's really important because you usually that much time or or whatever	2367	A
oh so that's why we're getting all these Dallas people that's what i figured but	2367	A
i didn't i don't want to assume that that's what i figured no i'm a college- i'm a university student so uh	2367	A
that also has a has a little bit of bearing on what restaurant choices you have when you're flat broke all the time	2367	A
but uh i'm going to be starting working full time this summer so maybe maybe my restaurants will change	2367	A
yeah	2367	A
um-hum	2367	A
no well actually i graduated	2367	A
i took one semester off and and i've been taking a class- at least one class every semester	2367	A
uh-huh	2367	A
yeah	2367	A
right	2367	A
uh-huh	2367	A
yeah	2367	A
um	2367	A
i've become a lot more health conscious and that's why i stopped eating fast food and places like that	2367	A
i used to love hamburger joints and i don't go to them i don't eat hamburgers anymore but	2367	A
i used to just i i used be a connoisseur of hamburger places	2367	A
Mike's Grill that's the place to go for the best burger	2367	A
yeah	2367	A
now i go for the best place to get uh tofu or whatever	2367	A
not quite that bad but uh	2367	A
yeah good talking to you we'll see you later bye-bye	2367	A
all right well what kind of uh restaurants what type restaurants you like to go to	2367	B
uh-huh	2367	B
yeah	2367	B
um do you like i mean what is it about uh the the kind of restaurants you go to that you like i mean what makes you like i said what makes you want come back	2367	B
is it well see uh qualities one thing but to me	2367	B
the uh not necessarily just the friendliness of the service but the service is real important to me	2367	B
uh i will go back to a place where uh i smile during the meal you know and just not just because of the food but i mean because either the waiter or the waitresses	2367	B
yeah exactly uh that's real important to me i i can't stand going to a stuffy place i mean it's just that's not me um in your you know like you said fast food restaurants aren't any good either	2367	B
but uh you know i don't necessarily- uh you know there's a place here uh it's um it's good- it's a barbecue place and it's uh you know you go through a line and and get your stuff	2367	B
but they make it fun you know they they they the people behind the counter are are laughing and and joking with you all the time and i you know that's one reason why i like to go back	2367	B
you know the food is excellent obviously that that is like i said that is important	2367	B
but um you know if i don't know that i would go back as often if it wasn't for the idea that i have fun there	2367	B
uh-huh	2367	B
have you ever gone to like dinner theaters or or uh things like that	2367	B
well see i'm uh i've been to dinner theaters but the- every time i go it's you know on the {nonmeal} show type- you know type thing so i've it's been a while since i've been to one uh	2367	B
yeah yeah um normally its comedy i i enjoy comedy although there's one that i'm i'm really looking forward to going to in the next couple of weeks it's a i just found out that well i'm sure they've they've had them for a along time but it's uh	2367	B
it's like a mystery uh theater uh that you you know you eat dinner and all through dinner they're they're doing this act and they they get supposedly get the uh the audience involved in it and everything and that that sounds like that would be hilarious you know	2367	B
cause- because_1 i love watching mysteries on on TV anyway and i love figuring them_1 out before they do you know	2367	B
of course that's probably a lot easier on TV to figure it out than it is in other things because TV they have a tendency to do a lot of things uh	2367	B
that aren't you know what i mean um predictable exactly but i mean you know the the dinner a dinner theater like this ought to be just wild i don't know	2367	B
yeah	2367	B
so um i mean is there anything else about a restaurant that would make you go back though	2367	B
no hadn't heard of them	2367	B
oh yeah	2367	B
uh-huh	2367	B
uh-huh	2367	B
um	2367	B
yeah that sounds kind of neat	2367	B
uh is location at all important to you	2367	B
like you know how far it is from your house or whatever	2367	B
well yeah i i guess	2367	B
yeah i i think my favorite restaurant is always been the one closest you know the closest- as long as it's it's it meets the minimum criteria you know of good food	2367	B
um no kidding	2367	B
working for TI that's pretty important	2367	B
yeah yeah	2367	B
so yeah that	2367	B
oh okay	2367	B
oh yeah money does	2367	B
yeah i can see that	2367	B
so	2367	B
so you graduating- are graduating or	2367	B
yeah well maybe i don't know i'd uh i really haven't changed that much since i was in school- in school um of course you know i'm not sure you ever get out of school to tell you the truth and uh	2367	B
depending on what industry you get into or whatever like uh you know TI being electronics uh you never get out of school so you know	2367	B
yeah well like i said though my my change- my taste in in food really hadn't changed all that much in in restaurants i mean a little bit yeah uh especially in you know i didn't have the money to go to these dinner theaters and stuff before	2367	B
whereas i you know i have gone to a couple of these things before- you know lately and you know it's like i said i missed the dinner- dinner part of it but i've gone to the theater	2367	B
uh but i you know like i said that's that's probably so price really i guess does have a lot to do with it i hadn't even really considered that before	2367	B
um	2367	B
yeah	2367	B
yeah well that's probably true to so	2367	B
uh-huh	2367	B
well unfortunately i'm not as good about that as you are i still go every once one in awhile	2367	B
yeah well it's like i said you know the different there are different reasons for different things like that and you know hey you're right health is one thing that just	2367	B
i was i was wondering yeah	2367	B
well all right well i think that should just about do it	2367	B
yeah take care uh-huh bye	2367	B
well last place we went was uh	2392	B
well our our kids are a little older actually we got a a seventeen year old and a and a fourteen year old but but we still wind up i still i like fast food reasonably well	2392	B
yeah	2392	B
well how old are your kids	2392	B
oh so they really like that sort of stuff then	2392	B
i can remember many times that when when- it's interesting though that that you know particularly when you're traveling and you go some place you can stop at a McDonald's that's that's a big playground	2392	B
uh when the- kids- you know when the kids really need to get out and run around after been driving a while	2392	B
yeah that that that's really nice that they started doing that because_1 it's the problem is you take them to some place nice and	2392	B
and you know the um even a place where they have to to sit down even if they really get kids they get they get bored in a hurry	2392	B
and uh yeah you know we now that we're a little older we can go to i- i still like um i like buffets	2392	B
yeah well have you been in the area very long	2392	B
oh	2392	B
you say you in Denison oh okay so we were i was in Sherman um	2392	B
hum	2392	B
last month of the i took a i sponsored a youth group up there and uh it was funny we went to a uh oh we must have had thirty of us and we went into a Pizza Hut	2392	B
and you wander into a Pizza Hut with that kind of crowd and they sort of hate to see you coming so they're they get the business but	2392	B
with a crowd of people it's uh it it it was kind of funny and we went in first and then it was so crowded and we went and i'm trying to think it's right off anyway i don't know if it's Pizza Hut or Pizza Inn anyway we went to another one and- and uh	2392	B
they the rates there are fairly reasonable but uh you know even those places are starting to have you know video games and things for kids to your kids play video games	2392	B
oh well that gives him something to amuse him while there uh	2392	B
yeah	2392	B
well do you have do you have any like Chucky Cheese or trying to	2392	B
well they got one um in Richardson probably me i try and think there there there's a couple of those that they combined and it's a combination pizza parlor and all kinds of	2392	B
and yeah and and- they have the the room full of balls and	2392	B
yeah yeah Show Biz that's the name of it	2392	B
well do you like the pizza at Show Biz	2392	B
oh	2392	B
yeah yeah	2392	B
well you know they're so large they animated it	2392	B
yeah that's really uh	2392	B
yeah we were until the kids got older we'd go there and you know it was um	2392	B
that right i'll date myself a little bit but it it's remarkable the number of those things they need	2392	B
i guess i think Show Biz and and Chucky Cheese and all those i think they merged or something but it still it's still quite popular i have to i'm not sure the pizza was okay i mean	2392	B
um-hum	2392	B
um-hum	2392	B
well	2392	B
well	2392	B
well do you ever go out to any of the higher higher end type more expensive places	2392	B
hum	2392	B
um	2392	B
well we got a lot of barbecue places around around the Dallas area uh Spring Creek Barbecue that's right in Richardson and it uh i- i like the barbecue there	2392	B
um and it it's fairly reasonable you can get um it i mean if if you know you go through the line and and pick up your food	2392	B
yeah it is	2392	B
they're probably just being normal though	2392	B
well when the you know it's funny when the- when the when the kids get a lot older though you can you can you can do as you please our son	2392	B
graduates this year and we're kind of looking forward to	2392	B
yeah yeah they're	2392	B
well the you know it's it's kind of like wanting to talk you know and um but and then they learned to say no and	2392	B
it's kind of funny but they	2392	B
uh the- the- and now they get older our son's a senior in high school will talk to us but he you know you know you know it's mostly	2392	B
um no it	2392	B
no no no and it's sort of i guess it's a little disappointing but but i suppose it's it's just the way life is but	2392	B
right	2392	B
well it it you know everybody all says ah you'd be surprised how quickly it comes but it it uh we moved here in seventy six and daughter was six weeks old and	2392	B
hard to believe in nearly fifteen years	2392	B
no i- i- i grew up in uh in Alabama	2392	B
well no actually and i was until i was eight i lived in in in south uh western Georgia and then we moved over into central part of Alabama	2392	B
but i've i've been away from there for	2392	B
goodness i haven't lived in Alabama	2392	B
since nineteen sixty five that's been a	2392	B
a long time ago i lived several places Europe and	2392	B
in Asia yeah i spent	2392	B
but so i was in the Air Force	2392	B
yeah uh i was i was i went in in nineteen and sixty five when they were drafting people in fact my father was on the draft board so	2392	B
yeah well it things are different when uh everybody in in fact that it that was Vietnam era i was in fact i went to Vietnam myself	2392	B
it was it's it's a different world	2392	B
well see i never had a hard time coming home it didn't uh you know there all these people that that would spit on them and all these kinds of things i- i- i came home and got married and i- i never uh	2392	B
i and could- now but i didn't and i mentioned that to my wife and she said well you never wore your uniform when you were off duty but i didn't uh i flew into Los Angeles	2392	B
um but i had um when i was in Vietnam	2392	B
but i by then when we landed actually went into Seattle Tacoma and i changed out of my uniform civilian clothes and	2392	B
and i never course i stayed in i stayed in the Air Force a number of years but i never had any problems	2392	B
um and all this the- all the of course i wasn't in combat either um i was a staff weenie	2392	B
well we don't do much eating out	2392	A
uh	2392	A
Benny's	2392	A
yeah well uh ours usually consists of McDonald's	2392	A
i've got two young kids and they love McDonald's	2392	A
yeah well uh i know	2392	A
it put on some weight for us so we stayed away them_1 or tried to but i love to take the kids they say uh what do you look for to bring them_1 uh to look at to uh come back to	2392	A
i was talking to my husband while i was listening to they was trying to find a call and uh	2392	A
i said it's the toy uh uh the play yard out in the front yard you know that McDonald's has	2392	A
four and two	2392	A
yeah they- they'd rather go out there and play in the yard than eat	2392	A
yeah well we've took a we was living out in Memphis and we used to drive back and forth to Louisville that's where we usually from Louisville Kentucky and uh you know we'd stop at the fast foods there uh	2392	A
usually i like to go just to get the kids out have them_1 in a confined space where i can uh sit down and relax and be able to watch them_1 too	2392	A
yeah	2392	A
yeah they got a couple all you can eat down here and uh we haven't went to them_1 yet but i've been threatening my husband that we'll go	2392	A
no we've only well we've been in Texas for two years little- a little under two years	2392	A
so uh	2392	A
not really i don't know it too well	2392	A
yes	2392	A
oh my son does he he's the four year old i've got a Nintendo that he plays with	2392	A
yeah	2392	A
yeah well he likes those crane games you know where you try to win a toy	2392	A
he likes every time we pass one he wants me to win him a toy	2392	A
i remember Chucky Cheeses was down in Lewisville uh i haven't seen one here	2392	A
in a game room and toy room yeah	2392	A
yeah Show Biz Pizza	2392	A
that's what it is Show Biz yeah uh	2392	A
yeah it's alright uh i haven't seen one down here i think where there was one in in Memphis when we was there	2392	A
uh and it was great Steven- the only thing that Steven didn't like that's my son was uh you know they had those dancing bears and stuff it scared him to death	2392	A
yeah i think that's what it was but uh he he'd rather go and ride on the rides you know they had airplanes that go up and down and stuff and	2392	A
well we went one time uh one of my ex-boyfriends had taken me this was years and years ago and uh i'd taken my younger brother he's about twelve years younger than i am and uh	2392	A
i remember eating their pizza and they had put anchovies and all this on it i mean they piled it up	2392	A
and it was the nastiest tasting pizza i've ever tasted	2392	A
me i rather go to Master- Mister Gatti's or there's a Godfather's down in uh Memphis and that was a good pizza i've never tasted a better pizza	2392	A
uh no the last expensive place i went to it was a it was a Shoney's huh and we went there every Tuesday night and or Saturday night when we was playing uh when i was playing softball with uh	2392	A
a softball league down in Memphis we went and uh that's the most expensive place we went to	2392	A
yeah well it's kind of hard to take two kids uh to a nice place number one they bug all the other people and uh or so we think they do and	2392	A
yeah but uh i don't know i every time i set up a baby sitter to uh go out and do something my husband uh nixes it and says we'll stay home this day	2392	A
and	2392	A
yeah well i can't i'll you know i say i can't wait for my kids to grow up but i believe i'm going to miss this age when they're gone	2392	A
uh but i- i do want my freedom back i'm sure my husband does too	2392	A
not really anything really important in his life	2392	A
yeah i- i can't- you know i can't relate to that just yet	2392	A
uh can't relate to a seventeen year old yet	2392	A
uh you sound like you got a Louisiana accent	2392	A
Alabama okay alright alright i guess	2392	A
close to the Louisiana border	2392	A
okay	2392	A
yeah	2392	A
military	2392	A
yeah my- my husband was in the Navy	2392	A
what were you in	2392	A
Air Force uh i he tried to get in there	2392	A
they wouldn't take him	2392	A
yeah well uh i- i was born in sixty five so i can't say that uh husband was only five years old then too	2392	A
yeah well uh	2392	A
yeah well i know uh i don't just- just out of curiosity how do you feel about these guys getting a welcome home that you all didn't get	2392	A
oh okay	2307	B
uh-huh	2307	B
okay	2307	B
right getting uh close to Mexico or	2307	B
all right and no	2307	B
and not the humidity i usually think of the South as being very humid	2307	B
Dallas is	2307	B
uh-huh	2307	B
i see	2307	B
oh	2307	B
oh you have to get used to hills	2307	B
yeah	2307	B
oh that's good	2307	B
oh that's good and what what is uh what is the temperature like down there now	2307	B
oh that's pretty warm already	2307	B
oh is that right	2307	B
actually last year uh um about a week ago at the same time last	2307	B
year um we had hit the actually uh nineties for about four days which is very unusual for this area at this time of year um what we're having right now is a lot of overcast	2307	B
you know a lot of days with uh drizzle or uh actually we've had a thunderstorm But about this time of the year March blows a lot of winds here and it's a very windy month	2307	B
um but right now we're in about the sixties which is is fairly comfortable	2307	B
yes we do they peak on Friday so if you have a chance to be here Friday or somewhere- somewhere around there that that's the best time to see them and they don't last too long you know	2307	B
yeah and uh then after after this month it'll quickly get get hot you know i mean March- April May it has a lot of rain uh May has quite a bit of rain and uh	2307	B
by May we're hitting in the eighties sometimes even low- low nineties uh but we don't really get the bad humidity here until July and August those are our worst months	2307	B
yeah	2307	B
right right so is everything in uh bloom down there now is it warm enough i guess all the trees are	2307	B
um-hum	2307	B
yeah	2307	B
oh right	2307	B
air quality index yeah	2307	B
oh	2307	B
right	2307	B
is that like a pollen sort of a pollen count yeah yeah well we're just starting now like i said the cherry blossoms are out forsythias are out uh no tulips yet so we're probably a few weeks behind	2307	B
uh you know down uh that area being that south you know and uh	2307	B
that lasts everything's in bloom you know everything's green here till about October and then we lose it all	2307	B
um-hum	2307	B
yeah	2307	B
um-hum	2307	B
um-hum	2307	B
i see	2307	B
i think it was in December one time and it was probably in the fifties and rainy kind of weather but in the fifties and i was shocked	2307	B
to see people all bundled up with scarves and hats as though it were you know in the twenties because here in the fifties people have sweaters so you know i guess it's what you become acclimated to yes	2307	B
um-hum	2307	B
right	2307	B
yeah	2307	B
yeah yes	2307	B
right right so uh yeah i i i like it better here i'm i'm uh formerly a Pennsylvanian and i have to say that i enjoy it	2307	B
that much better here a lot more sunshine and a lot less cold you know but i don't know about ever going that far south to live you know i guess you after a while whatever you get used to is what what you enjoy that's right	2307	B
um-hum	2307	B
right	2307	B
no	2307	B
oh is that right	2307	B
ah that's interesting	2307	B
um-hum	2307	B
yeah yeah so i guess that once they're used to the wide open spaces huh that that that yeah that that's interesting so	2307	B
yeah i think i'll take the area with trees huh yeah yeah	2307	B
okay well nice talking to you alright well- bye bye	2307	B
okay well now i'm from Dallas	2307	A
well actually i'm living in Dallas i'm not from Dallas i uh was living in West Texas before this uh which is a very dry arid	2307	A
well obviously it's it's kind of a desert area	2307	A
um-hum real close New Mexico anyway	2307	A
well he Dallas is and that's since i've moved up here now so i'm starting to get a little bit of this but	2307	A
i'll tell you uh considering well okay i've uh mostly throughout my life i've lived in in the smaller uh parts of of Texas and so moving to Dallas i was a little worried about the traffic	2307	A
um	2307	A
the differences in terrain because uh you know Dallas is is a lot more hilly than it is where i i was living and i had just bought a new car and it had uh had standard- standard on you know standard and i had never had a standard car before	2307	A
right so i mean i was real worried about you know having a a a lot of ice and things like that we just had a wonderful winter i mean there was one or two days of ice the entire winter	2307	A
i mean we had cold weather we had a little bit of snow here and there but i mean i couldn't have asked for better first year of getting used to Dallas and my car at the same time i mean it just worked out great for me	2307	A
oh well today it was probably in the eighties um well yeah we've had uh we've had several days in the eighties in fact i'll tell you what last night i came real close to turning on the air conditioning i didn't do it	2307	A
i didn't do it but i came close	2307	A
um-hum	2307	A
i would imagine yes	2307	A
um-hum	2307	A
right	2307	A
um-hum	2307	A
well i heard the uh that um Washington DC has actually got the cherry blossoms blooming so	2307	A
so that's	2307	A
hum well yeah that's i heard that	2307	A
um-hum	2307	A
um-hum well that's that's sort of what happens here except uh we may start a little earlier and end a little later but uh	2307	A
yeah they've been they've actually been going at it for a good you know four weeks now i would think um	2307	A
you know in fact it's kind of funny uh you know you're watching the newscast i don't know about way up they are up there but the weather cast down here one of the things that they like to do is to tell you what's all in the air you know the fungus and the the trees you know yeah well	2307	A
but mostly it's you know allergy type index and it's been like like i said about four weeks now that uh they've had um	2307	A
multiple pages of things and you know of of names of things in the air and uh you know so that's a real good sign that that the trees are in bloom and the flowers are in bloom and stuff like that	2307	A
pollen count yeah exactly	2307	A
um-hum	2307	A
um-hum	2307	A
yeah	2307	A
well it's it's um it depends on what part of the south i think the farther east you go you know from from here on east uh you do have a a limited	2307	A
winter um now south of here uh like in Houston i did uh even though i said i lived mostly in the small towns i lived a short time in Houston it was winter	2307	A
and you know the coldest day we got down there was like in the sixties you know when it got down in the sixties you were cold down there	2307	A
yeah	2307	A
yeah that	2307	A
um-hum	2307	A
um-hum	2307	A
oh yes it's a big difference i have a one of my friends is from Kansas City and uh he has lived down here for like eleven years but he refuses	2307	A
to get to to where everybody else is i mean he will he will not wear long sleeve shirts he will not wear you know jackets and things like that i mean he's the only person i know	2307	A
that in thirty degree weather still has a short sleeve shirt on you know um but it you know it's still not cold cold here uh compared to what he's used to so	2307	A
um-hum	2307	A
well i think that's true yeah	2307	A
although there's you know there's you don't ever want to get	2307	A
too much different to what i mean uh i grew up with a lot of trees around and then i lived out like i said in West Texas where it's desert and there's not a lot of trees and that's the main reason i moved up here was that i did not i mean i hated	2307	A
seeing you know no trees i mean it's just you could stand on a rooftop and see for miles and miles and miles you know	2307	A
well now that's that's not necessarily true there are people that are born out there that can't stand it here	2307	A
they they feel claustrophobic around trees i thought that was hilarious when i first heard it but i mean i heard it from more than one person so it's got to be somewhat true i mean	2307	A
exactly	2307	A
yeah i see i wouldn't have thought that from the beginning but uh i've talked to so many people about it that it makes sense now i guess	2307	A
hum i agree i agree of course i wouldn't mind having an area with ocean but we won't get involved in that either	2307	A
yeah yeah that sounds good	2307	A
um-hum	2307	A
okay well	2307	A
it was yeah nice talking to you too um-hum bye-bye	2307	A
okay	2324	B
no i don't like the metric system	2324	B
i- i- i think the country is is um too ingrained in the inches and and just the general um background the history of our country has been inches and i don't think there's a big advantage in going to the metric system	2324	B
it it's gonna disorient it and confuse a lot of people for years and years and there are going to be people who die because of it because they don't understand	2324	B
um you know simple things from the amount of medicine they should take to how fast they can drive and you know how far away something is and	2324	B
it's it's not in our national consciousness to do it we've always measured things in the English system	2324	B
and you know everything you know our land is in acres our people aren't going to understand what an amount of something is	2324	B
yeah	2324	B
i mean- it's	2324	B
yeah	2324	B
and it's easy to translate- we have a computer for just about everything now and if it's necessary to translate back and forth between them_1 it can be done	2324	B
because i'm a mechanical engineer and i've had to work when i was designing packages for people i mean i had to to work both systems back and forth and it was not hard	2324	B
and you get you can get a CAD CAM system that can take any design you want and you can push a button and it'll convert every	2324	B
measurement on there you know from one system to the other in seconds	2324	B
really	2324	B
yeah	2324	B
absolutely	2324	B
oh yeah it's just	2324	B
or or even have had the ability you know the chance to to go to college or to to to learn about it i think it's still good they do cover the system and i think it should still be taught in schools	2324	B
you know we learned what a centimeter was and a decimeter and the various you know basically the other alternate forms of measurements and things like that	2324	B
and and that's acceptable	2324	B
because	2324	B
yeah	2324	B
really	2324	B
yeah-	2324	B
you know you need twenty gallons but do you need how many liters	2324	B
yeah	2324	B
yeah	2324	B
and it it just doesn't yeah it doesn't make that much difference in the average life in the scientific community and places where it's needed	2324	B
you know that's fine and the rest of the world i mean we are uh we- if not we may not be the top i don't know if we're the top we're one of the superpowers of the world	2324	B
it may be arrogant but i mean let them come to us	2324	B
yeah it it's kind of like expecting- expecting everyone to suddenly speak German	2324	B
you know	2324	B
okay_1	2324	B
yeah i -it's been nice talking to you	2324	B
okay_1	2324	B
yeah	2324	B
all right	2324	B
-well good talking to you	2324	B
bye bye	2324	B
okay_1 um why do you think it um failed do you think we should adopt it	2324	A
you don't	2324	A
um-hum	2324	A
yeah	2324	A
yeah	2324	A
right	2324	A
yeah i agree- i agree with you i don't think we should either even though i know there are benefits to the metric system i don't think the benefits of the metric system outweigh the the disadvantages that would happen to the people of America	2324	A
and also the um i don't know it seems almost like there's this it's a peer pressure thing is why we keep wanting to do it is so we'll look good to the other nations	2324	A
because i think they that's an area that the other nations especially Europe look down on us like oh we're just backward wayward children who still use this backward system who haven't really attained it yet	2324	A
and i feel it's just pride of why they keep trying to push it on us and it's like hey we're content with this no it's probably not as accurate probably	2324	A
you know intellectually doesn't it's not as sound intellectually but like you said i mean come on i had six years of college and i don't know the metric system and i don't care to learn it and i'm not some kind of an idiot i just	2324	A
yeah	2324	A
um-hum	2324	A
right	2324	A
there's a lot of people like you're educated i'm educated my husband is	2324	A
but i mean a lot of people are flat not educated	2324	A
and if i have a hard time you know putting that into my life can we put that off on the other eighty percent of the population that doesn't have any college or i don't know how much of the you know but a large percentage probably over half of the rest of the population	2324	A
they don't have any college probably much at all and if we can't take it and use it easily well we how can you put that on like elderly people and	2324	A
you know just people that maybe just aren't blessed with as as much sharpness and mental- mental acuity	2324	A
yeah	2324	A
yeah	2324	A
um-hum	2324	A
right	2324	A
yeah	2324	A
yeah i think it failed too because like what you said of just you know hey this is ridiculous i think Americans have so much stress on them_1 right now	2324	A
i mean if you look at the average family it's like man they barely have time to stop and get gas much less to try and figure out how much gas they're really getting and do all this and it's like i mean come on let's take the pressure off	2324	A
yeah and it's just like another thing the American family doesn't need any more pressure just leave them_1 alone let them_1 measure their green bean water in cups and leave them_1 alone	2324	A
i don't know	2324	A
yeah	2324	A
uh-huh that's	2324	A
and and if they don't like the way we do it just get off our don't worry about it and i think	2324	A
right it is because_1 it is another language yeah	2324	A
that's funny well that's good -well i think we kept it at real good	2324	A
is that all we need to say	2324	A
you too i think that was good that was the best one usually i get distracted off the topic you know what i mean	2324	A
and we'll end up one man was telling me about his grandfather in Lithuania and we were talking about something totally- income tax or something and i just	2324	A
anyway the i appreciate it have a good day	2324	A
okay	2373	A
no i had to press one	2373	A
sure	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
i think we should have stayed longer	2373	A
uh i think what we did was good but i think we just should have stayed there longer and continued doing what we did do	2373	A
yeah i think we should have stayed and kind of helped the people in Iraq out now because it's kind of like a civil war going on now And it's almost like they're killing each other off	2373	A
and there is not going to be anything left of Iraq at all	2373	A
well i think i don't think it would be good if we were to completely lose it um	2373	A
well no i just mean that the world in general	2373	A
yeah	2373	A
Um	2373	A
i don't know i think we should have helped the the innocent people in Iraq out a little bit more than rather than just quitting where we did	2373	A
yes But i think that's almost impossible next to impossible	2373	A
oh see i haven't really been keeping up with them so i really don't know what he said what did he say about it	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
we don't have the money for that	2373	A
It would be really nice because i'm kind of tired of driving in pot holes	2373	A
i'm sorry i dropped the phone	2373	A
yeah	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
oh really	2373	A
oh well you guys you you have more flats don't you it's flatter out there	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
oh i didn't realize that	2373	A
no huh-uh	2373	A
only in Ohio	2373	A
i've never been past Ohio	2373	A
no huh-uh i've never seen anything out i never seen the great i've seen	2373	A
i've never seen i've seen pictures of it but	2373	A
i've never been there i've seen pictures i just i'm a college student and um	2373	A
i'm paying for my own education and i'm i come from a large family and we we we're never able to take vacations because there's there's twelve kids in my family	2373	A
so	2373	A
oh my	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
really	2373	A
yeah	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
well um i'm i'm originally from Butler and that's about an hour away from where i am now i'm at Clairon And um it's it's pretty like windy and hilly	2373	A
oh i couldn't even tell you	2373	A
it's not like a mountain it wouldn't be like a mountain it's uh	2373	A
oh i don't even know	2373	A
i have no clue	2373	A
i would say it's closer to sea level	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
oh well see um	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
um	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
uh the farthest away from home	2373	A
probably- i'd say five or six	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
oh my	2373	A
oh my gosh	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
oh yes Now see for me that's a long ways	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
even well like i i'm in like a little town right now it's smaller than Butler and um	2373	A
Butler Butler is about an hour north east of Pittsburgh So that will give you some idea of where i'm at and i'm about	2373	A
i'm about two hours north east of Pittsburgh	2373	A
and uh i mean just this this little town here here is basically a college town	2373	A
the college without the college here this town would be nothing It would be absolutely dead because it's completely made up of fast food restaurants	2373	A
and and in the summer when we come- uh my fiancee's family lives up here we come up here in the summer and it's i mean there's just no one around	2373	A
um well i go home in the summer and i work in the summer and between what i make in the summer and student loans that's how i go to college	2373	A
finance	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
um well like i said my fiancee	2373	A
no No no no um my fiancee works down in D C and i'd actually like to work for a company rather- rather than a bank or a something i'd rather work for a company	2373	A
and um like be their financial advisor or something	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
oh really	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
take a boom a little bit	2373	A
well well what would be the unemployment rate out there	2373	A
see that's what it is here too	2373	A
uh-huh	2373	A
yeah It's even getting hard for the four year people to find jobs	2373	A
i know people that have been out of school for two or three years and they have a job that has nothing to do	2373	A
was i supposed to do something	2373	B
good uh let's see	2373	B
so	2373	B
uh	2373	B
were we right in the Middle East	2373	B
should we have been there	2373	B
did we do what was correct there	2373	B
should we have fought them harder	2373	B
used more weapons equal to their chemical weapons that weren't used	2373	B
oh you agree with Schwartzkopf who says uh Drive on into Baghdad	2373	B
would that be so bad	2373	B
was there anything there	2373	B
to begin with	2373	B
it wasn't ours	2373	B
well we've got to talk so it's just just as well we argue	2373	B
i agree	2373	B
wouldn't it have been wonderful	2373	B
if we could have freed the country	2373	B
yeah so other political things that's going on i heard mister Bush say uh excuse me President Bush say that he uh	2373	B
wanted to improve the highways	2373	B
oh he wanted to take the current secondary highway system and	2373	B
turn it into	2373	B
interstates like	2373	B
the rest of the country	2373	B
but wouldn't it be wonderful	2373	B
and back east you all drive at fifty five don't you	2373	B
what's that oh okay um i say back east you all drive at fifty five don't you see out here in the west	2373	B
a lot of our secondary roads are fifty five	2373	B
we drive sixty five oh yes well	2373	B
i uh	2373	B
last weekend went home to visit my parents my dad's in the hospital and uh	2373	B
between	2373	B
here and west Texas there was probably three and four hours at sixty five miles an hour	2373	B
nonstop have you have you ever been out here	2373	B
how far west have you been	2373	B
oh you've never	2373	B
you've never seen the great American desert	2373	B
the Rocky Mountains	2373	B
Yellowstone	2373	B
uh	2373	B
well my college education- uh thirty six worked for Texas Instruments for seventeen or eighteen now	2373	B
uh know virtually nothing else uh yeah i got my four year got my BS in General Science	2373	B
yeah i know it's a funny degree uh anyway uh i know nothing other than the west in fact uh	2373	B
down in east Texas where the company's located there's streams and water and things i don't understand trees and have	2373	B
the gulf and	2373	B
it's really interesting so tell me about where you live	2373	B
uh how high is the highest elevation	2373	B
like uh probably	2373	B
three thousand foot	2373	B
close to sea level	2373	B
okay uh right here in Colorado Springs where i live	2373	B
it's over six thousand foot	2373	B
um	2373	B
yes when i lived in Texas every year i had to drive you know i drove every year to the gulf and you know so i could have a feast of fresh seafood	2373	B
six eight twelve hours away	2373	B
you know just just for fresh i	2373	B
i'm really interested in the basic concept differences between west and east coast and the central parts of America	2373	B
how many hours have you been from home	2373	B
yes	2373	B
oh yeah	2373	B
uh	2373	B
now when i was growing up	2373	B
in the Panhandle of Texas look at your map later and see the the town of Amarillo	2373	B
fifty miles north of that up in the Panhandle to just go buy a pair of jeans we'd drive an hour	2373	B
when i was growing up now things are different and people buy jeans in town but	2373	B
uh we thought nothing at all of wake up waking up in the morning hop in you know the car grabbing fishing poles and driving four hours	2373	B
yeah it is i imagine	2373	B
okay okay i'll look at my map later	2373	B
wow how neat	2373	B
so are you working your way through college	2373	B
well how neat what's your major	2373	B
finance	2373	B
well that's interesting	2373	B
so uh what do you plan to do with it	2373	B
savings and loans uh	2373	B
oh that would be great that would be neat	2373	B
let's see uh so we're all excited in Colorado Springs Apple Computer is coming to town	2373	B
yes the uh new employer in in the city	2373	B
so we're expecting our local economy to	2373	B
uh maybe not boom but uh at least recover to where we can all hold regular forty hour jobs still	2373	B
uh	2373	B
unemployment runs approximately six percent	2373	B
but now under employment	2373	B
i would suspect to run closer to eighteen or twenty percent	2373	B
and the problem is that	2373	B
there are no good permanent full time jobs for people without	2373	B
a technical four year degree	2373	B
yes it is	2373	B
i i assume- i assume you have kids	2362	A
oh well she she doesn't have to worry about public schools yet	2362	A
ah	2362	A
well we have a little bit of a basis for conversation i was a substitute teacher for about a year	2362	A
yeah i uh thought i wanted to be a teacher so but before i went through all of that i wanted to see how i was going to like it	2362	A
and they uh	2362	A
in Alabama where i came from they they allow you to substitute if you got a four year degree	2362	A
so i went out and played substitute for a while and decided nope not for me	2362	A
yeah it was i just took grades one through six i thought i was going to be smart and get the good kids wrong	2362	A
um	2362	A
um yeah	2362	A
hum hum	2362	A
well i i sometimes wonder if i didn't mess up i maybe should have taken the higher grades because_1 at least you can	2362	A
if you have to you can get mean with them	2362	A
those little kids don't understand it	2362	A
um-hum	2362	A
yeah	2362	A
well that's a nice way of putting it	2362	A
exactly- exactly	2362	A
and two most people don't have that option	2362	A
you know and plus it also depends on the district you're in as i mean on the i've seen some districts where all the schools are lousy it doesn't matter what you do	2362	A
uh accept for the private ones of course we're talking about public	2362	A
i don't know back when i was going to school uh you just didn't get away with things these kids get away with now	2362	A
i mean you you pulled stunts like that and you were down at the principal's office and	2362	A
usually bending over to get five of the best	2362	A
um but now nowadays they can't even they can barely scold the children for something you- you know without getting sued	2362	A
oh yeah	2362	A
well the thing that really did it for me i was subbing in a fifth grade class	2362	A
and uh	2362	A
this kid comes to school with his lunch box	2362	A
and inside this lunch box he's got	2362	A
easily two i'd say two hundred two hundred and fifty dollars in one dollar bills	2362	A
and i asked him uh what are you doing with that	2362	A
he says my father gave it to me	2362	A
and i didn't believe it for a minute	2362	A
um	2362	A
so uh but uh you know the not a lot i could do about it	2362	A
can't stop the kid from bringing money to school if he wants	2362	A
well i have i i've fully i think i understood what the what the kid was doing	2362	A
he was a uh	2362	A
well let's just say he was one of those types that you wouldn't doubt that he was selling something	2362	A
but not a lot i could do about it	2362	A
um-hum	2362	A
yeah because_1 uh that just that doesn't do a lot for them_1 i mean it alleviates your problem but it doesn't do anything for them	2362	A
uh i don't know guns and	2362	A
i don't know that's something	2362	A
um-hum	2362	A
oh yeah	2362	A
yeah	2362	A
oh sure i mean it's- it's- it's indicative across the board that we we've done something wrong	2362	A
and when you see uh Koreans and Chinese and Japanese who are taking all the uh science jobs all the engineering jobs all the mathematical jobs	2362	A
and you know here we are we can't we can't balance a checkbook without a calculator	2362	A
um	2362	A
i don't know	2362	A
um-hum	2362	A
yeah	2362	A
no	2362	A
yeah that's that's a great deal what law school's like	2362	A
yeah	2362	A
um yeah	2362	A
and uh i just same sort of thing they just you you sit there and read hundreds and hundreds of cases and then you get one exam for the whole semester	2362	A
and it's how well you can remember it all	2362	A
yeah and i found that a particularly useless way of studying	2362	A
um	2362	A
i never did i always tried to understand things not tried to memorize	2362	A
and consequently some of the very best students were had excellent memories	2362	A
but they couldn't put two and two together as far as the law was concerned	2362	A
so uh it didn't show me anything a year and a half i gave it up	2362	A
i wasn't really want i didn't want to be a lawyer anyway just wanted the degree	2362	A
so	2362	A
well i don't know what can we do about it	2362	A
money money is not the answer	2362	A
yeah i mean they're- they're throwing more money at it now than ever before and things are getting worse	2362	A
um-hum	2362	A
um-hum	2362	A
um-hum	2362	A
yeah	2362	A
yeah	2362	A
well i don't know i uh as much as i didn't like school when i was going through it	2362	A
from my perspective now i can see that it's a lot better	2362	A
than what we have now	2362	A
and i think part of it is that they've got to give authority back to the local school	2362	A
you know i mean it's- it's silly that these that these people are handcuffed when it comes to discipline	2362	A
yeah exactly i mean i	2362	A
i- i mean teachers are so afraid now of even saying something	2362	A
to students because they're going get they're going to get complaints or they're going to get sued or something	2362	A
oh yeah	2362	A
well lawyers help create that	2362	A
well i think i think i i mean what we've turned the schools into now are just day care centers	2362	A
you know somebody okay we're going to send our kid here for seven or eight hours a day and he's out of our hair	2362	A
and the other part of it is parents have quit becoming parents	2362	A
you know they just	2362	A
oh sure i mean- mean you you can you can have the best school system in the world if you don't get anything- anything at home then it's it's not going to help either	2362	A
so i i don't know i don't know what the i don't know what the answer is	2362	A
it's an interesting interesting thing you want to do i how is Texas about keeping your children out of public schools do they allow it	2362	A
um-hum	2362	A
um-hum	2362	A
um-hum	2362	A
hum	2362	A
that's interesting i remembering reading a few cases about that when it when some people first tried that and they got sued	2362	A
got taken to court by the school system	2362	A
i'm glad the parents won i mean that's	2362	A
and then uh	2362	A
uh we have one she's only nine months old	2362	B
right well my degree is in teaching so	2362	B
so i	2362	B
oh really	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
did you teach in all subjects or in all grade levels or	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
well my degree was in fourth through seventh grade but i taught junior high	2362	B
and i expected it to be a lot of trouble but it wasn't that bad i taught remedial reading kids	2362	B
and well they don't call it remedial reading these days they call it something else but but anyway at the time that's what i taught and um	2362	B
you kind of group your behavioral problems together that way	2362	B
when you have your slow readers but it it wasn't too bad we we got along real well	2362	B
yeah i especially with the real young ones i started out wanting to teach elementary- lower like primary and then top primary and thought well no i don't like this as much and ended up moving up and	2362	B
got up until about the sixth grade and so that's what i got my certification in	2362	B
but i had decided long before i was even married that i wanted to if possible teach my kids at home and not put them in the public schools	2362	B
um and my reason for that was i don't like	2362	B
the	2362	B
uh what's the right word the varied	2362	B
inappropriate influences that you find so much in the public schools	2362	B
you can find a lot of good public schools if you if you look real hard	2362	B
but i don't think they could cover everything that you could	2362	B
teach your children on an individual basis	2362	B
yeah	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
right	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
yeah	2362	B
and the the um the crime is just escalated and the drugs and even in the the lower the lower schools	2362	B
um	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
right	2362	B
crazy for him to but	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
yeah	2362	B
well we had the problem when i was in with teaching um i was eighth and ninth graders that i worked with and if we did have a a student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of calling the police and have them_1 taken out of the schools	2362	B
or trying to teach them something while they were there	2362	B
and you don't know if you were reaching them_1 or not but we felt like you know maybe just going ahead and try to teaching them_1 was better- trying to teach them was better than have them_1 taken out	2362	B
yeah	2362	B
um i don't know if it was alcohol or something else that they were on but	2362	B
it ended up better	2362	B
but	2362	B
i think there's a problem too with teachers trying to um	2362	B
to be so versatile that they do lose sight of the basics you know they've been a big drive in especially in the seventies to return back to the basics	2362	B
and uh and i'm not	2362	B
completely just you know just teach the basics in schools but i think there does- does need to be a reemphasis of those because of our our lowering grades in the standardized test and such	2362	B
but	2362	B
right	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
well i spent a year and a half in Japan also and i've seen how their school system works and i they go by a complete rote system you you just memorize everything	2362	B
and then at the end of the of a certain time period you spitted everything back out and the better uh memorizer you are the better your grades going to be	2362	B
so i don't completely agree with that either	2362	B
oh is it	2362	B
is that what you ended up going into	2362	B
oh	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
how how much you can stuff in your brain	2362	B
yeah	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
yeah	2362	B
yeah	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
yeah	2362	B
yeah	2362	B
well	2362	B
good- good question	2362	B
probably taking	2362	B
no there's plenty of money in the system it's just	2362	B
i think it's uh like a lot of things in the in the the United States we've got so much built up in um	2362	B
in the state- in the bureaucracy and in the politics of it and in the the power plays that it needs to be pulled down and started over again and there's no way that that can be done	2362	B
not without wiping out a whole generation of of kids in the school system and so	2362	B
maybe on smaller smaller scales	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
yeah	2362	B
um-hum right into the classroom it needs to be	2362	B
be able to be enforced	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
it's like doctors in lawsuits you know they're kind of fearful of everything	2362	B
that's that's true i've well at least i've heard that i i i haven't fortunately been in a situation where it's been applicable to me but	2362	B
but	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
right	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
oh yeah it has to be reinforced in the home	2362	B
yeah	2362	B
right	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
yeah they allow it under certain circumstances you have to to prove that you're teaching them something you have to follow	2362	B
a preferred curriculum um well they try to encourage you to to follow a specific curriculum although you don't have to	2362	B
and then if you have particular religious beliefs they have to be	2362	B
they're kind of monitored	2362	B
you know they they will allow you to i can't think of any examples but certain religious groups don't want their children in public schools because the influence and maybe if they was a group of Mennonites or something like that i don't think they're is in in this area but	2362	B
um they they are monitored by the uh	2362	B
by the	2362	B
state school board	2362	B
so	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
um-hum	2362	B
well i think i think basically we're in a lot of agreement uh in that i certainly agree that	2302	B
for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs uh some kind of legal definition	2302	B
but for anything involving that a trial by jury certainly should be mandatory	2302	B
but there should be uh with our	2302	B
overworked	2302	B
uh judicial system it seems to me like there ought to be a means of	2302	B
of um	2302	B
not having to take everything	2302	B
before a	2302	B
full court you know maybe there ought to be some kind of of uh as- as as an example where called a jury duty now	2302	B
and and maybe instead of of uh	2302	B
just kind of blowing it off and just spend a day or a day and a half like most folks do	2302	B
maybe we should commit to spend a week and during that week you're kind of an ad hoc let's hear about it group of i don't know twenty five instead of twelve	2302	B
and each- each case is presented to that group of of twenty five and those cases are of lesser degrees of magnitude	2302	B
you know the guy was caught burgling uh and he had his pockets full of stuff you know when he was caught uh you know that kind of stuff you can just turn to the judge and say you know your pleasure your honor	2302	B
and there's not a lot of discussion about that kind of thing but the way our system our court system works that guy's going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time	2302	B
uh i just think our system is overworked and we're starting to stress the true meaning of of right to a speedy trial	2302	B
you know we	2302	B
you know kind of deltaing off what what we've been talking about here uh i believe that	2302	B
our we've- we've become almost litigious uh society where we're everyone- everyone is very quick to sue or to threaten to sue and that kind of stuff	2302	B
and although we're supporting a whole segment of society called lawyers maybe we don't need to do that	2302	B
you know maybe instead of of being so quick to sue you uh if you have a disagreement with someone	2302	B
instead of tying up court and time and that kind of stuff maybe you need- you and if you want to your lawyer or your your opponent	2302	B
need to go face this group of twenty five or a Judge Wapner like you know that they have on TV and let	2302	B
either he or that group decide whether or not you have a real case and let's you know let's get rid of some of this harassment suing	2302	B
you bet and if	2302	B
if we could all deal with those kinds of beliefs we wouldn't have half the	2302	B
yes i'd forgotten what that's called there's a a real name for that like the Judean law or something like that	2302	B
well that may be right it's in there some place i think we both know what- that we're talking about the foundation of our legal society	2302	B
uh to-	2302	B
and too the that was sort of the the beginning of ye shall be treated fairly	2302	B
uh	2302	B
i guess the the Lord started out with we'll treat you fairly- i'll treat you fairly there as long as you do what i say	2302	B
uh that's sort of the Old Testament version	2302	B
i know i did a Sunday school lesson one time on the difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament where where there's a vengeful Lord in the Old Testament and there's a loving Lord in the New Testament but that's a whole different subject	2302	B
okay well i i think we have exhausted my pitifully small knowledge on on the legal system	2302	B
but it's been a pleasure talking with you	2302	B
i'm living here in Texas	2302	B
well that's quite all right	2302	B
well so am i fact i'm at work out at Lewisville	2302	B
my pleasure have a good day bye-bye	2302	B
okay uh let's see i i believe in the trial by jury i think if it was up to the judge alone that	2302	A
there would be real possible for uh payoffs you know briberies uh unfairness one-sidedness you know all those kinds of things	2302	A
and i i also like the unanimous decision because you have to persuade everybody to be a hundred percent absolutely sure before you convict somebody	2302	A
i really- i really agree with the uh innocent until proven guilty	2302	A
theory i think that's	2302	A
that's a good way to do it	2302	A
you know that's about all	2302	A
um-hum	2302	A
um-hum	2302	A
um-hum really	2302	A
um-hum	2302	A
um-hum	2302	A
right	2302	A
yeah	2302	A
right	2302	A
yeah that's that's a good idea maybe this pre group of people could decide you know which kind of uh	2302	A
you know where they could go from there do they need a big lengthy uh twelve person jury- jury or do they need a six person jury or you know those kinds of things and	2302	A
the degree of the of the you know the seriousness of it you know how	2302	A
is this open and shut you know like you were saying or do you need somebody to go off for three months and try to figure out what really happened you know a jury like that	2302	A
yeah that's uh that could be a good idea to uh that could work	2302	A
um-hum	2302	A
yeah	2302	A
uh-huh	2302	A
yeah	2302	A
yeah right that	2302	A
right that's that's a good idea i in the Bible it says uh if you have something against somebody to go to them_1 first	2302	A
and if that doesn't work then to go get somebody you know a little bit more wiser and older and take them with you and go to them_1 and if that doesn't work to take it to the whole church	2302	A
so that's right off that same kind of principle	2302	A
that's a that's a good idea	2302	A
but uh you know that whole Biblical concept like that that's true in a lot of our um	2302	A
you know the the way the whole judicial system and the government is based on that it doesn't work on that but it's based out of that	2302	A
and uh so that you know that could work there	2302	A
um	2302	A
what is that called the Judeo-Christian ethic Judeo-Christian ethic	2302	A
yeah	2302	A
right	2302	A
right right	2302	A
um-hum	2302	A
yeah that's	2302	A
really	2302	A
really	2302	A
really yeah	2302	A
yeah mine too	2302	A
yeah same here what- what part of the country are you from	2302	A
oh okay in in Texas okay i was just being curious	2302	A
okay yeah well i'm i'm from the Dallas area oh okay well that's that's neat	2302	A
oh are you really wow okay well i'll let you go and it was nice talking to you	2302	A
oh you too bye	2302	A
oh who doesn't have credit cards	2390	B
yeah	2390	B
yeah	2390	B
oh i know it's it's Christmas is the worst time for- i just have to leave them at home uh because the impulse buying is just terrible	2390	B
oh yeah uh-huh	2390	B
yeah	2390	B
oh that's good that's really good	2390	B
oh i know i know	2390	B
no	2390	B
oh i i i know i know people that are just uh uh uh are addicted to their credit cards	2390	B
and they've just gotten themselves so much in trouble financially with with them	2390	B
it's it it's just unreal	2390	B
i guess	2390	B
oh yeah	2390	B
oh of course	2390	B
yeah plus uh uh when you get uh uh credit card companies send you things in the mail all the time	2390	B
you know uh get- please get- get- get- and you're already preapproved and all this other kind of stuff	2390	B
you know they just try to uh to to get you to get- uh have their credit card and um you know uh six- half a dozen isn't enough	2390	B
oh i have one we well we have- we have one one Master Card	2390	B
and	2390	B
yeah	2390	B
yes you do uh-huh yes you do yes you do and that- that-	2390	B
uh down here uh you have to have a credit- uh you just can't live without it	2390	B
because down here they don't take a check unless you got credit card and driver's license identification	2390	B
yeah uh it's it's just a another form of identification you know just to	2390	B
oh yes oh yeah they can	2390	B
yeah	2390	B
uh they're all well ours is ours is through our our credit union and it's thirteen so it's	2390	B
that's not that's really good compared to eighteen and twenty one which some of them are uh uh some of them are really extreme- high	2390	B
it's it's uh	2390	B
yeah	2390	B
is it i i don't know we don't- uh we don't	2390	B
my husband has one for to- for uh for business	2390	B
it's a company card	2390	B
but he's never had to use it so we don't get any get anything uh for it	2390	B
i mean we we- we would if we used it we would get it and then uh the company would reimburse any company expenses on it but but so far he's never had to use it so we don't know anything about the billing	2390	B
do they uh uh ooh	2390	B
that could get you in awful lot of trouble	2390	B
yeah	2390	B
yeah	2390	B
i don't- i don't know i think it's uh just a lot of companies prefer American	2390	B
yeah i i don't know if it's easy for them to get or or or what but um	2390	B
uh but i guess it's it's run so much different from the other ones	2390	B
hum	2390	B
yeah	2390	B
oh i i i'm sure there are i mean uh	2390	B
you take	2390	B
oh gee oh gee oh	2390	B
do they um it's it's some cards you- you can do that and some cards you can't down here	2390	B
i think it just depends on what the what the banks will take	2390	B
plus	2390	B
oh so on on uh on some cards	2390	B
uh-huh well i saying through my bank they they since they have their own card they don't like to give advances through other for other cards	2390	B
that that doesn't solve anything	2390	B
that just	2390	B
yeah	2390	B
because_1 it's still there	2390	B
it's just some place else now	2390	B
oh yeah store credit cards	2390	B
store credit cards are even higher interest rate than say Master Card or Visa	2390	B
because i i had a i had a Neiman Marcus card for a while	2390	B
and i used it once and then i cut up because the interest rate was like almost twenty three percent	2390	B
so i i cut- i cut that thing up	2390	B
uh-huh	2390	B
oh really	2390	B
ooh	2390	B
yeah i also was going to say they get it from both ends	2390	B
uh i didn't know	2390	B
wow	2390	B
oh how awful	2390	B
yeah oh boy those people are making money hand over fist	2390	B
well but everybody's really trying to you know it's become a real national problem credit card debt	2390	B
and and i we've really cut	2390	B
oh	2390	B
it it is it is it they- uh you hear a lot about how much uh uh shaky the economy is just because of personal debt	2390	B
and what they're talking about is credit cards	2390	B
yeah	2390	B
uh-huh	2390	B
i don't know if they count uh	2390	B
mortgages as personal debt	2390	B
i don't i'm not sure that they do i think uh	2390	B
what they're talking about like is uh credit cards and other junk and loan car loans things like that	2390	B
because uh	2390	B
boy i know people who kids- people right out of college the credit card people like to get you	2390	B
because because they uh they spend they use the credit cards real easily and real freely and then they get in real trouble	2390	B
yeah	2390	B
yeah	2390	B
oh i know it you become a slave to your plastic	2390	B
okay um do you have a credit card	2390	A
i know i've got one um i i did have two and	2390	A
the i found that um it just made me spend a little more so when i paid one of them off i got rid of it now i have two only have one	2390	A
um	2390	A
i don't know i always used to be the person that would put something on and pay the bill right up	2390	A
and now i've after every Christmas it seems the last few Christmases i used it for Christmas and i'm still paying it off	2390	A
i don't know i consider myself pretty good but sometimes i can go out and i can i can over overspend my budget i guess i can afford it but it is it's a pain paying it off	2390	A
i i don't i don't know um	2390	A
i had uh i have seven hundred dollars in mine now and i've put- saved up enough money where i'm going to bring it down to two hundred and hopefully i can keep it around there	2390	A
yeah i know a lot of people have i mean fifteen hundred dollars two thousand dollars	2390	A
but um	2390	A
i don't know i never i never liked loans a lot so i'm not a heavy credit card user i have a girl friend that she probably has two thousand dollars on couple credit cards so	2390	A
i know it's easy to do especially if you if you have a job where you have to buy nice clothes and things	2390	A
it it i think that is the biggest problem when you really not you don't	2390	A
don't really need the stuff but the nicer looking clothes are the more expensive nicely tailored clothes	2390	A
even though you could probably get away with a cotton dress you got to go out and buy the rayon dress or something you know	2390	A
you got to be they say you have to dress for success	2390	A
yeah	2390	A
how many credit cards do you have	2390	A
that's pretty good	2390	A
yeah my oh my husband won't even put his name on it i don't believe in those	2390	A
it's like but but the time we went to Florida and needed to rent a car you know he believed in it	2390	A
because you've got to have a credit card to rent a car	2390	A
yep that's right- up here at some stores- if it's if you're not in your home town you have to show them a credit card	2390	A
well actually if your check bounces i guess they could legally take it off your credit card if that's why they're taking it i mean i don't know how fair that is	2390	A
but i don't know um	2390	A
yeah i guess that percentage rates are like eighteen percent	2390	A
yeah thirteen that's not bad	2390	A
yeah	2390	A
and yeah then you have to pay your fee and American Express you're really it's not a credit card because you have to pay it off at the end of the month but the fee for that it's really expensive isn't it	2390	A
i've never had one	2390	A
oh	2390	A
that's good	2390	A
yeah if he they they they have you pay it right out every month	2390	A
yeah because it's uh	2390	A
i know especially if your uh	2390	A
your reimbursement didn't come through	2390	A
from your company because i know they i don't know why but you can use American Express and they give you an itemized bill and	2390	A
you can use that i don't know why you can't use other credit cards for business that way	2390	A
American Express	2390	A
yep this is this is it actually kind a boring subject in credit cards	2390	A
you really you just know some people abuse them but not a joke about the person who pays their Master Card off with their Visa	2390	A
i bet you there- i bet you there are people that do that	2390	A
you go get a cash advance on one credit card to pay the other	2390	A
they- i think they charge more for cash advances so	2390	A
well it yeah you can't get cash advances	2390	A
oh	2390	A
oh well no uh it i think that's a really bad plan in your budgeting if you have to pay one card off with another oh eventually- eventually	2390	A
no it doesn't	2390	A
be solid for a couple of weeks then you get both bills back	2390	A
i know i don't	2390	A
credit cards almost seem unfair to a person who's who's got a victim of impulse buying	2390	A
like unfair advertising or something	2390	A
oh wow	2390	A
so also when you give give someone a credit card like a normal credit card like a Visa or something	2390	A
that that um business person loses four percent because i used to work in a business and we always- and we used to lose four percent on the credit card orders	2390	A
yeah it's it's the thing if if a business is taking a credit card they're really they sacrificing something too it seems the credit card company makes money all the way around	2390	A
because it is a four percent that they take	2390	A
three or four percent	2390	A
i don't know which put you in better rating yep because when i used to go to the bank	2390	A
i used to take it off the deposit	2390	A
you do have to take it off your deposit	2390	A
yeah so it is a a service that they're offering	2390	A
i i know should own stock	2390	A
there instead of these uh	2390	A
uh banks going that are folding but	2390	A
i wonder how much is numbers how many billions of dollars it's got to be billions of dollars	2390	A
yeah	2390	A
that's uh probably true	2390	A
i mean you have the principal debt the car loan and your house loan	2390	A
and then there's all the merchandise you buy on your credit cards	2390	A
that's personal	2390	A
maybe they don't	2390	A
yeah	2390	A
i know i had a girl friend she just got married out of college and the husband had taken- confiscate her credit cards	2390	A
i mean i don't know it's probably they're always saying the women are doing are the spending ones	2390	A
but i haven't heard one- uh a single woman taking their credit card away from the man	2390	A
well i don't know um i i definitely want to get mine- up mine paid off month to month like i used to	2390	A
and just as soon as i get it paid off i'll probably get laid off	2390	A
terrible can't afford my credit card anymore	2390	A
good	2332	B
yes yes we do right here at the at the very building they have uh a nurse's office	2332	B
and uh i haven't	2332	B
my name hasn't come up yet how about_1 you	2332	B
right	2332	B
right	2332	B
yes that's the the major issue i guess that uh	2332	B
i have a a similar opinion at first i	2332	B
wasn't sure	2332	B
but	2332	B
then	2332	B
i thought it was a good thing for the company as as well	2332	B
uh uh we had a couple of people in our group who wrote- one who wrote a huge letter to the editors	2332	B
saying that it's a violation of my rights and this and that and the tests aren't accurate and	2332	B
but i think they've got that testing down to a real science where you know they don't really- you know	2332	B
i'm i'm sure you saw the video on how they do the testing and it it's almost impossible i think to uh	2332	B
to make a mistake	2332	B
right	2332	B
right	2332	B
who were uh	2332	B
right and that and that's a lot of money	2332	B
and	2332	B
oh oh taking drug testing	2332	B
oh sure i think that's that's	2332	B
i feel that you know for certain cases that i that i am willing to give up my rights	2332	B
to secure the rights of others i guess is what i'm saying	2332	B
uh when the public whole ah is at stake	2332	B
then i'm willing to give- you know personally i can't speak for others but for myself i'm willing to say okay you know	2332	B
if i see this is a right to if to privacy i'm willing to give up that right	2332	B
because i can see that it's uh	2332	B
public good is at stake and the company good is at stake and	2332	B
you know if they can get this thing under control you know it it's going to save us all money	2332	B
as far as benefits and everything else you know insurance and and and and everything else in this country	2332	B
right	2332	B
right you don't work in an area where there's chemicals or machinery or or things like that but	2332	B
and um they don't have any of that up here but you know um	2332	B
i guess it's just the productivity	2332	B
and the the number of uh uh sick days i guess	2332	B
and that they uh	2332	B
that they accrue	2332	B
right well well i- i think they would you know someone on drugs probably misses more work	2332	B
and then i guess that's why this smoking thing came out too	2332	B
when they're drive- and that's why why i guess the car insurance has no nonsmoker rates or whatever as well	2332	B
yeah	2332	B
oh yeah	2332	B
they	2332	B
nonsmoker-	2332	B
at least down here in Texas they have nonsmoker-	2332	B
nonsmoker they call them_1 discounts	2332	B
they give you if you're a nonsmoker i- i guess there is some kind of studies that show	2332	B
but if you're smoking	2332	B
you're not you're not as you know when you're lighting up or something you know your hands both hands aren't on the wheel or whatever	2332	B
that's yeah i guess that takes effect in uh	2332	B
when June July yeah	2332	B
right there was a lot of uh controversy about that too i'm not a i'm not a smoker myself	2332	B
i do	2332	B
yeah i'd probably get upset	2332	B
yeah yeah	2332	B
right right	2332	B
right	2332	B
right	2332	B
right if they i- i- i assume if they they	2332	B
i guess they're saying with the cigarettes though that they've been able to show that it's the number one	2332	B
leading cause of preventable	2332	B
preventable	2332	B
death in this country was a half a million people a year or so dying with smoke relating smoking related	2332	B
right right right right well that's all what i always felt if it if those studies were true about smokers having higher medical costs	2332	B
and we do have one smoker in our area who and he	2332	B
he seems to miss a lot of work	2332	B
but um	2332	B
um forty	2332	B
eight maybe	2332	B
yeah forty five forty eight	2332	B
yeah but then there's people you talk to and say i've never been sick a day in my life you know so i guess i guess you know the the studies show as an average	2332	B
not specific cases and uh	2332	B
i thought well with you know if that's really true then	2332	B
then i guess i agreed with the extra premium	2332	B
if it could- i mean if they can come along and prove that French fries	2332	B
were the same deal then they have a right to charge for that too i guess	2332	B
yeah that that it's a major cause of uh early	2332	B
right	2332	B
well it depends if they're cooked in	2332	B
yeah	2332	B
right	2332	B
right	2332	B
right it it's the it's the honor system isn't it	2332	B
it's the honor system i know it'll be an interesting experiment to see how	2332	B
yeah	2332	B
right	2332	B
right well well i think the same way with alcohol too	2332	B
personally it you know that that would probably be the next	2332	B
the next thing	2332	B
i mean	2332	B
but you know there's- there's the difference because_1 uh they say you know	2332	B
i guess they say tobacco is addictive i guess they say alcohol is addictive as well	2332	B
oh yeah that's	2332	B
there is oh there is	2332	B
right	2332	B
right	2332	B
right	2332	B
yeah well it's part of the business world too when you make	2332	B
deals you know a lot of times it's uh	2332	B
three martini lunch or whatever they say	2332	B
right	2332	B
yeah	2332	B
yeah	2332	B
makes me feel better	2332	B
right	2332	B
the nicotine addiction yeah	2332	B
yeah i have uh my in-laws are both smokers and uh they've tried to quit	2332	B
numerous times and	2332	B
and i think the longest they've made it is about three months and then they go to a a friend's house or something and there they're all smoking and	2332	B
and they break yeah they just can't stand it you know all of a sudden they get it's overwhelming and then they break down and then they say i'm a failure and then they just give up you know	2332	B
were known yeah	2332	B
so	2332	B
well i think we've probably talked long enough	2332	B
well i can tell you're from you've got that New England accent	2332	B
does that mean you're you're you're in uh uh New Hampshire- what-	2332	B
Massachusetts	2332	B
yeah i have uh	2332	B
my wife's uh grandparents are from Boston they're	2332	B
hi how you doing	2332	A
do you do you have uh drug testing where you are	2332	A
uh-huh	2332	A
uh yeah i have uh what i've found out out of curiosity was my name has uh has come up twice and we've only been involved with the program say about a year	2332	A
and uh when i when i first heard about it i was very uh very defensive i didn't think it was something that that the companies ought to be doing	2332	A
because i felt that i was losing something or taking something away from me	2332	A
yeah but now um now that it's happening i	2332	A
i feel comfortable with it i- i don't feel as though i've lost anything and that i feel uh secure in that i know that everybody that works	2332	A
around me um	2332	A
is is drug free	2332	A
how how about_1 how about_1 where you-	2332	A
um-hum	2332	A
well i was involved in uh in the in the initial training program because i had to go out and teach or explain to other people	2332	A
what we were doing why we were doing it so i- i guess i had a little uh uh first hand knowledge of	2332	A
of uh seeing the films i had more of extensive training in in uh background information of the reasons why they were doing it the cost that uh	2332	A
uh that we projected that it that it actually cost companies by having people uh uh be involved with drugs	2332	A
oh yeah	2332	A
how do you feel about other- other uh things like public uh safety buses bus drivers and and uh airplane drivers or or	2332	A
pilots rather	2332	A
you	2332	A
yeah	2332	A
yeah	2332	A
well i	2332	A
um	2332	A
yeah the the uh i've always felt that public people who are involved with the safety of other people should be drug tested i've i have- never said that i didn't want that the problem that i had was	2332	A
whether my coworker is on drugs or not has does not have an influence on my safe well-being	2332	A
no so i had uh	2332	A
right	2332	A
well i'm sure that's still going to happen	2332	A
uh smokers typically have more time out of work they're uh uh more prone to accidents and all of those other things and and uh	2332	A
for for automobile insurance i had no idea	2332	A
that they were doing that i know that they originally talking about uh health	2332	A
uh-huh	2332	A
you're not as attentive	2332	A
um	2332	A
uh that's uh that's different i've never heard of that how about the um	2332	A
the the smoking premium	2332	A
out in Texas i understand they they started doing that	2332	A
June July	2332	A
yeah that they from what i understand that uh notices went out to all of the sites	2332	A
yeah	2332	A
well that's that's the problem that's you don't uh how about_1 uh do you eat- do you like French fries	2332	A
what- what would you what would you ever say if they said anybody who eats French fries has to pay a ten percent premium on their life insurance	2332	A
uh then you would get upset it's it's uh what they're doing is they're nibbling at the population piece by piece	2332	A
and uh and now they know that the number or percentage of smokers is is less than the the uh the people who do not smoke then they can go ahead and do that um	2332	A
preventable death not yeah but	2332	A
yeah but isn't isn't the uh the insurance also for for uh Blue Cross	2332	A
so they're not only saying preventable- not preventable death they're also saying um	2332	A
that you'll have uh less likelihood of being sick if you don't smoke	2332	A
uh-huh	2332	A
is he an older person	2332	A
well that	2332	A
that's not too old	2332	A
yeah and he and he does miss a lot of work	2332	A
yeah	2332	A
yeah	2332	A
well	2332	A
what- what do you mean if they can prove it there there's already	2332	A
hardening of the arteries it's it's uh sure it is high cholesterol	2332	A
see- see one of the things that will determine whether they're able to do that or not is not their ability to prove that it is unhealthy because we all know that French fries are not healthy for you it's the capability- it's the capability of detecting it	2332	A
how do you prove someone has eaten French fries	2332	A
um but i think in time come you're going to see that happening you're going to see um where the high risk people pay a premium but they have to find a way to prove it	2332	A
yeah yeah	2332	A
uh	2332	A
but yeah but there are more drinkers than smokers if you think about it	2332	A
and and drinking is still socially acceptable where smoking is socially unacceptable today and so that there's a big difference so that so that they really can't make a a change in in policy about drinking until	2332	A
yeah- yeah right right yeah	2332	A
so i guess you can you can classify alcohol as a drug so is a cigarette in my opinion um where it's not something- i don't think people that are that are smoking are doing it voluntarily i think they're doing it involuntarily	2332	A
i know i am um i don't know anybody in their right mind that says that that i'm doing it because i want to i	2332	A
well i- i- i do i do make that statement i say i do it because_1 i like it but i can't say i'm i'm i'm doing it because_1 i want to i'm doing it because_1 i have to uh or because- my desire is greater than uh	2332	A
uh-huh	2332	A
start up again	2332	A
i uh i started when i was younger and uh	2332	A
it was prior to the time that the the risks were uh were known	2332	A
okay nice talking to you	2332	A
and you've got that Southern accent	2332	A
i'm in the Attleboro-	2332	A
Attleboro Massachusetts plant	2332	A
yeah	2332	A
oh no kidding	2332	A
okay so what kind of car are you thinking about getting	2336	A
well when you decide to	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
so you like the Ford	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
right	2336	A
uh-huh Yeah it's the this the car i had before this one was a Thunderbird as a matter of fact and uh i loved it i really did	2336	A
But uh um i finally decided to go check out what the uh what the uh foreign cars were So i bought myself a a a Nissan a two forty S X	2336	A
But even though i love the car i've got now i think my next car will probably be American again because if i can at all do it i'd like to stay American i always have up until now i just for one time decided to go outside So	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
right	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
well Ford's done a real good job in the last uh say ten years or at least the last five to ten- six years so of really turning around their um quality i think um	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
um	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
oh yeah those were not good cars	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
right	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
right	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
uh-huh You know the only thing i'm looking at right now um i just i just bought you know the Nissan that i've got about uh say nine months ago i guess it was	2336	A
So the only thing that that would um get me to change cars right now would be if see at the moment i'm single	2336	A
and if i were to get married and have a family that would have to have something to do with it But uh i don't have any plans for probably another two three years of even looking you know	2336	A
uh cars are too expensive right now to uh	2336	A
to even think about buying new cars every couple of years you know it's	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
um	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
yeah that's uh i went to a a car show down here about uh about two weeks ago	2336	A
and um you know of course they had the normal the Ford the the Chevrolet that stuff But	2336	A
then you started looking at the uh uh they had Ferrari there they had uh BMW and and all these other kind of cars and and Ferrari didn't even let you near the car i mean they were that's how expensive they were	2336	A
um and then you saw uh hundred thousand dollar cars you saw eighty thousand dollar cars and	2336	A
you know even even though i i i do enjoy cars i enjoy um driving them i enjoy uh riding in them and everything but uh i can't see buying or paying more for a car than i would for a house you know i	2336	A
that doesn't seem likely	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
i think so	2336	A
that's happened to me once so uh	2336	A
yeah like uh you know i think the one time i did it was on Saudi- the Mid the Mid East the crisis out there and everything that was had a great conversation but uh then they came off and told us we couldn't do it any more so	2336	A
uh-huh	2336	A
yeah	2336	A
you too uh-huh bye-bye	2336	A
i currently drive a a Ford Taurus and	2336	B
i would imagine- i would imagine that if i change or if i get another car a new car i will go with the Taurus or something similar uh in that regard	2336	B
absolutely i have had it for about two years now and it's uh	2336	B
it's everything it's supposed to be uh i haven't had	2336	B
a minutes trouble with it and uh	2336	B
the only thing i have	2336	B
against it in that's it's a Taurus but is it i still feel a little even after two years i still feel uncomfortable driving it because i had a Honda before that	2336	B
and so it's a little bit larger but that's the only the only difference that i see really	2336	B
but i would my my criteria would be at the moment it would be uh American uh personally	2336	B
and	2336	B
um-hum	2336	B
uh-huh	2336	B
uh-huh	2336	B
well my wife drives a	2336	B
still has a a Honda Accord and it's a very it's an excellent automobile	2336	B
and uh but you know price and so forth i'm not a real car fan so i i	2336	B
i do not uh	2336	B
opt for uh something that would be	2336	B
you know	2336	B
expensive you know i want i want something that's serviceable serviceable something that i can use and uh and i and with the Taurus i have a Taurus uh you know LX and it's you know	2336	B
you're talking when you think about price it's several thousand dollars lower than the comparable Honda or Nissan or something along those lines	2336	B
and as i said as far i'm concerned it it has been extremely uh uh serviceable and everything i wanted	2336	B
uh-huh	2336	B
oh i think so too now i	2336	B
you know in travel and renting automobiles uh in i've driven you know Chevrolet automobiles and so forth- and Dodge and i	2336	B
if it's Chevrolet i just will not touch it uh	2336	B
i had a Chevrolet before i bought my Taurus i purchased a	2336	B
a Chevy um Citation	2336	B
and uh i was ready to get rid of it two months after i bought it and uh	2336	B
so i i shopped around and i would i probably if i had thought i	2336	B
uh wanted to pay the amount of money i probably would have gone with uh uh an Accord or even a a Civic or something comparable from Nissan or or Toyota	2336	B
and uh but it was just i had i have a friend who uh has a uh an auto shop	2336	B
and he purchased one of the first Sables that was uh manufactured for his wife a Sable station wagon and he just absolutely swore by it	2336	B
and it was upon his recommendation and so forth for you know comparable	2336	B
comparably equipped you know with cruise control and air conditioning and AM FM radio and all these other things uh	2336	B
it was just there was no there was no comparison uh the only thing that i find you know if i would have anything against it is that it still has that	2336	B
soft American ride uh uh not well that about the only thing i find you know disadvantageous to it	2336	B
but my criteria is simply something that looks good something that's serviceable	2336	B
and i you know i drive around a lot but uh and it's you know it's very comfortable on the highway i can drive for you know ten hours or so and	2336	B
not really be tired in any way	2336	B
but those are my criteria and i i probably in another six months to a year or something will probably start looking around again and if there's something out there that uh	2336	B
is comparable to what i have now	2336	B
so i'll go ahead and get it	2336	B
um-hum	2336	B
uh-huh	2336	B
i see yeah	2336	B
in our parking lots uh two or three days ago i saw one of the new Honda sports cars	2336	B
uh i i can't remember what the name is it's the thirty five or forty thousand dollar one whatever it is	2336	B
and it looked it resembled a Mazaratti very very closely	2336	B
and	2336	B
it's an absolutely beautiful automobile and well appointed and so forth but	2336	B
to pay that much money for an automobile uh is just	2336	B
um-hum	2336	B
that's true well	2336	B
uh the difference there is too is uh is between us is that	2336	B
i am not really crazy about driving i never have been since you know my parents had to force me to get my driver's license when i was young when i was sixteen	2336	B
so i've never really cared now what i was you know before i was married and before i went to graduate school i used to do little	2336	B
you know sports car racing i never	2336	B
it was never my own car it was always someone else's	2336	B
and that sort of thing i enjoy but to go out and drive	2336	B
uh never has really been had any appeal to me in that regard so	2336	B
well i guess we've discussed that enough don't you think we won't we don't we won't get the recorder or the uh system to shut us off uh tonight that's happened to me almost every time i've	2336	B
well when- it's it's very easy when you get a topic- you get on a topic that you know you enjoy and	2336	B
oh yeah yeah	2336	B
well i was talking to a lady last evening and we were talking about fishing and uh we were cut off uh-huh well we were told to quit okay well you have a pleasant evening	2336	B
take care good-bye	2336	B
i tell you what here in Dallas it's uh it's awful bad because that they're i i believe there's starting to be a lot more violent type crimes	2378	B
uh where you see armed robbery and and uh rape and murder you know are starting to be a lot more prevalent in this area	2378	B
and uh that's that's getting that's getting scary because i grew up in a real small town and i moved here to Dallas and uh it's been a rude awakening i tell you	2378	B
uh right right	2378	B
well see it's it it's really just a suburb uh i really can't even tell where Plano starts and Dallas Dallas ends	2378	B
but uh i grew up in a real small town in north Texas and uh moved down here to Plano an and uh	2378	B
it's uh it's definitely a big change	2378	B
right	2378	B
i see	2378	B
not really the violent crimes then	2378	B
i see	2378	B
i see	2378	B
right	2378	B
okay so that's real close	2378	B
right	2378	B
right	2378	B
oh Lord	2378	B
right	2378	B
you know i've heard about that uh also for tennis shoes	2378	B
there was uh uh a big surge going on oh just last year i think where uh kids like in New York uh were uh knocking off other kids to get their tennis shoes	2378	B
yeah i tell you what though if you go price some of those tennis shoes i can see why now you know they're getting up in the hundred dollar range	2378	B
and that just seems ridiculous	2378	B
for a pair of tennis shoes yeah	2378	B
so	2378	B
that's right	2378	B
i don't know what the answer is though to to try to fix that problem	2378	B
right	2378	B
exactly yeah just economic- overall economic uh times around here in Texas have been tough	2378	B
yeah	2378	B
right	2378	B
to get it yeah	2378	B
well another- another problem i think is the the drugs	2378	B
you know uh people have to get money for the the drugs and	2378	B
and they'll just go out and do anything they can to do it	2378	B
right	2378	B
right	2378	B
right	2378	B
exactly	2378	B
right	2378	B
yeah it's hard to get a job you know	2378	B
right	2378	B
you know we really haven't uh because the oil industry just hasn't come back like it was	2378	B
and so much of our economy was based on that	2378	B
so	2378	B
yeah yeah	2378	B
right that that and real estate you know just have not come back uh even close to what they were	2378	B
and um yeah Dallas is you know you can see some economic turnarounds but uh and i don't think it will ever be back to what it was because it was you know it was really blowing and going there for a while	2378	B
i see	2378	B
right	2378	B
right	2378	B
right	2378	B
and	2378	B
right	2378	B
that's right	2378	B
what's going to stop them_1 from you know other people to	2378	B
well that's true too yeah yeah	2378	B
but you know the violent crime is is uh definitely something's got to be done on that	2378	B
because_1	2378	B
right	2378	B
golly that's ridiculous	2378	B
right	2378	B
right	2378	B
they just overlook that as uh common occurrence	2378	B
right	2378	B
oh that's	2378	B
golly that's terrible isn't it	2378	B
right	2378	B
well see i'm not either because i'm i'm really not for higher taxes you know to go out and pay for uh more people to be out on the street	2378	B
as far as the officers and things like that but uh	2378	B
i think yeah that's true	2378	B
and uh	2378	B
right	2378	B
so i don't know	2378	B
well i do too and you know i know people argue that that's really not a deterrent and people don't think about that but i've i've got to believe that	2378	B
in the back of their mind if they know they're going to go out and kill somebody and that you know they're going to get the death penalty then and that it will actually happen	2378	B
you know so many so many of these jokers get the death penalty and then you know just end up in prison uh	2378	B
right	2378	B
you know with the chance of even getting paroled and uh you know that's just	2378	B
i just don't understand that	2378	B
but	2378	B
right that's true yeah	2378	B
right	2378	B
right right because you know a lot of countries just shoot you on the spot you know forget that trial and the jury and all that you know they just	2378	B
and then do it huh	2378	B
that's right	2378	B
right	2378	B
exactly	2378	B
exactly and and	2378	B
you know i don't even know if they are worth rehabilitating if if uh they go out and commit some of these violent crimes	2378	B
so but i don't know what the answer is we'll just have to i guess each each person will just have to try to do their part and	2378	B
right	2378	B
okay Jay um	2378	A
could you tell me uh what your thoughts are about crime	2378	A
oh so that's	2378	A
what do you do work in Plano	2378	A
how how far away is that from Dallas from the city itself	2378	A
oh so it	2378	A
yeah that's uh that's the same with me well um	2378	A
i grew up in a rural area there's nothing but farms	2378	A
and i still live in the same area it's it's built up somewhat and crime	2378	A
really hasn't been a problem it's been uh	2378	A
uh mostly outsiders coming in and you know robbing or breaking into automobiles and stealing uh	2378	A
radios and cassettes and things like that	2378	A
not so much in in the town i live in now but but the closest large city in Rhode Island is Providence and then it's Boston which is about uh	2378	A
oh forty five fifty miles away	2378	A
which is really not that far	2378	A
and Providence is only like a dozen miles from from where i am	2378	A
but the cities down there yeah and and	2378	A
and the next one up is uh is a small city between me and Providence	2378	A
and that they're stealing handbags now in broad daylight they're taking the the crime now the latest thing up here is	2378	A
uh they'll somebody be driving along whether they're they're in their early twenty's or or teens	2378	A
and they'll steal jackets they'll holdup kids and they'll take their jackets and chains you know just get out of the car and	2378	A
because they have got some of these like the leather jackets are are quite expensive	2378	A
they just that's that's incredible	2378	A
yeah that's	2378	A
yeah for a pair of tennis shoes	2378	A
yeah yeah no shoe is worth that that price uh	2378	A
you know not to not to go out and scuff up and	2378	A
but	2378	A
i don't know what the it's	2378	A
it's probably the uh the times now um	2378	A
i know you guys down there have had have had a problem for a while which we're experiencing now with the savings and loans and	2378	A
yeah and rents are are extremely high i mean people and they just don't care	2378	A
you know it's either it's either you go out and you and you steal something or you you bash somebody over the head	2378	A
or you starve	2378	A
yeah	2378	A
yeah	2378	A
we had we had uh an incident in our town not too far from where i live where uh	2378	A
the police made a raid on and- and most of them were teenagers or or	2378	A
in their early twenties	2378	A
which is unheard of in a small town	2378	A
you know you don't usually associate associate that	2378	A
but they did they made the raid you know and the whole town was upset	2378	A
but i'm not so sure now if if uh if the drugs are really prevalent they're saying that alcohol now is is uh one of the major contributors	2378	A
like all of all the students now on campus uh i guess most of them drink or have binges on weekends and	2378	A
and going to school	2378	A
is also always very prohibitive now unless your parents are wealthy	2378	A
you know you either have to take a loan or most of them don't work or if they work they work part-time for	2378	A
minimum wage yeah	2378	A
yeah i'm not sure down there if you guys are all picking up but up here it's it's terrible	2378	A
so you're still suffering then	2378	A
as far as that goes	2378	A
yeah	2378	A
yeah i was down	2378	A
i was in Dallas about uh twelve thirteen years ago and then i just went down again last month for a week	2378	A
and it was it's like one huge city when i was flying in	2378	A
it was just all lights	2378	A
but you couldn't tell there was a problem	2378	A
you know because it's so huge	2378	A
part- part of the problem too i think up here is i mean um	2378	A
all the banking crisis all the white collar crimes uh stock brokers have been getting away with bloody murder the bankers have been getting away with bloody murder	2378	A
nobody's being prosecuted	2378	A
so	2378	A
right what's	2378	A
yeah what's the what's the poor guy going to do that's that's you know being threatened or thrown out on the street and he's got a family to support and he's got no job	2378	A
um	2378	A
i'm not sure how much of that is is crime rather than just kids out there for a good time yeah	2378	A
yeah because there's more and more there's more murders we had uh	2378	A
just in southern Massachusetts and Rhode Island over the weekend we had five murders	2378	A
yeah i mean Rhode- Rhode Island's just like a neighborhood compared to you guys down there it's just so so so small	2378	A
and nobody even cares or nobody seems to care	2378	A
yeah yeah	2378	A
yeah and if it's if it's drug related they turn the other way because that's one less problem that they have to put up with the law enforcement	2378	A
and uh if they do come in i've got some friends on the police force and they say that you know they apprehend somebody and they bring them in and uh and they let them out they're out on the street before they get their reports done	2378	A
so there's no checks and balances	2378	A
and i'm not sure what what to do about that or which way it's going to go	2378	A
yeah	2378	A
they're being overwhelmed i think anyhow i mean	2378	A
the fire power against them now is is atrocious	2378	A
you know they've got	2378	A
all kinds of automatic weapons these criminals do	2378	A
and these poor guys out there uh trying to uphold the law	2378	A
um	2378	A
i don't know i kind of think they should bring back capital punishment	2378	A
well	2378	A
it's yeah yeah	2378	A
yeah for twenty or thirty years or forever there's no	2378	A
yeah um	2378	A
and when i say there's no deterrent you know of the death penalty	2378	A
um that's like saying that	2378	A
you don't put up any stoplights anymore because it's not a deterrent for people to stop at crossroads	2378	A
so it- it just doesn't hold water and you look at some of the other countries that that have the death penalty	2378	A
and they don't have anywhere near the crime rate that we do of the violent crime rates that we do	2378	A
yeah- i- yeah i wouldn't want to see it go that far	2378	A
you know give them due process and then and then let them	2378	A
and then let them appeal yeah then you'd get yeah because some of it some of it's it's it's just down right	2378	A
uh mean i mean they go out there just just for the sake of of harming somebody	2378	A
and those are the people that you know can you rehabilitate them the some of the ones that are you know perpetual	2378	A
um	2378	A
yeah	2378	A
yeah he can	2378	A
because it's eventually it's going to it's going to swing back	2378	A
it was	2378	A
they had the death penalty way back and then it swung the other way and everybody's swore you know we're no better than they are if we if we put the death penalty in and	2378	A
well i i think it's been interesting to hear you know about the overall outlook you know before we ended the war what implications we'd be dealing with uh you know the	2394	B
strong religious beliefs and uh you know it's just another	2394	B
uh attitude you know and what we are really getting into and and the fact that that that war you know coalition forces stuck together uh and uh	2394	B
you know i just think now is that they should- they should have finished Saddam off because i think	2394	B
we're just going to see repercussions- repercussions- repercussions down the line because he's he'll probably maintained power it sounds like he's uh you know uh knocked down the revolt you know so	2394	B
or at least got Saddam	2394	B
you know if they you know if they	2394	B
yeah no i i don't think i don't i don't think a lot of them_1 didn't want him to lose control- you know power completely but it's hard to say um	2394	B
yeah to go against- to go after the political heads of state but	2394	B
yeah	2394	B
yeah but	2394	B
anyway but now it looks like uh you know Kuwait has asked us to defend its borders more of a permanent type of basis which will be a first	2394	B
uh	2394	B
so it's interesting uh uh	2394	B
yeah	2394	B
yeah	2394	B
yeah i don't know if the interested- yeah United States is interested as much as establishing a democracy	2394	B
as opposed to just getting rid of Saddam you know it just uh	2394	B
but you know we'll see if if anything if he	2394	B
if he gets stability uh and he doesn't you know get knocked off you know by a coup or something down the line you know what happens you know down the road i just uh it'll be interesting	2394	B
yeah	2394	B
yeah	2394	B
um-hum	2394	B
yeah well it's interesting	2394	B
yeah interesting there's like a two square mile- mile area that's occupied by some Iraqi soldiers and Kuwait's saying it's their land	2394	B
and they have the their line of demarcation is that what they call it uh	2394	B
and they've already outlined that for the cease fire and uh apparently we don't want to deal with that but the Kuwaitis want this land want these this- this- this land back that they're saying it's theirs	2394	B
so that- that was kind of interesting that we said that we said no we're not going to get involved you know we've already established you know the line of cease fire do you you know and the uh demarcation line so	2394	B
um they were definitely trying to avoid any hostilities i thought it was interesting though that we did knock- uh shoot down some of their airplanes when they went up but i don't think they're doing that anymore	2394	B
yeah yeah well well well they warned them_1 they- we told- we told them_1 we would this is after that cease- the cease fire so	2394	B
i don't know maybe they were helicopters i thought they were airplanes- i thought they were letting the helicopters fly around and- and-	2394	B
yeah	2394	B
anyway so it's uh	2394	B
yep	2394	B
yeah	2394	B
uh well they hate i mean they hate us over there most those people uh	2394	B
but obviously i think it was	2394	B
influenced- influenced- you know the heads of state obviously you know	2394	B
you know the ones that uh let us in but uh	2394	B
it's- it's- it's that's anyway i would think uh	2394	B
yeah i think it was good that we-	2394	B
that- that we got that you know that	2394	B
you know we drew the line somewhere	2394	B
and uh whether that uh	2394	B
you know what effect it has in the long run you- you know to be all right	2394	B
um-hum and i and i think	2394	B
yeah i the think you know it'll deter the next person from	2394	B
you know uh thinking the same types of things but i think the problem is that we'll never get away from	2394	B
the expansion idea i mean you know we're territory- we're territory in general we're going to run into another you know uh	2394	B
i don't want to go so far and say it's a Hitler but crap Saddam seems like he's as bad as Hitler almost by the way you know they torture and kill people you- you know from what you read but uh	2394	B
you know once the nuclear power you- you know nuclear uh	2394	B
you know bombs uh get in the hands of some of these other countries uh for them to you know who knows uh	2394	B
who may try what down the road	2394	B
yeah that's another thing is that they you know they just they don't understand implications i don't think or or may or may not but um	2394	B
yeah well we'll see and you know it has i most- i may fairly young here i got to	2394	B
they keep saying they think he won't make it but it looks like he's you know taking control of all these cities that were uh besieged by the rebels but sounds like he's gotten control and	2394	B
you know it's just a matter if if he can survive you know without somebody else you know a coup attempt or something	2394	B
um	2394	B
all righty and uh take her easy all righty bye-bye	2394	B
i really- i really don't know enough about the Middle East to form solid opinions but i don't uh how about you do you have a solid opinions on on US involvement	2394	A
uh-huh	2394	A
totally different world	2394	A
hm	2394	A
so you're saying that the coalition forces should've got went ahead and uh gone in and taken out uh Iraq instead of just recapturing Kuwait	2394	A
yeah and well bad thing is i mean you can't do that because the the Saudis asked you know the Saudis were were helping you know out	2394	A
on only under the condition that they would help that the United States and the coalition force would help Kuwait regain their country	2394	A
and otherwise- otherwise otherwise	2394	A
right	2394	A
and plus you know it's illegal you know in uh	2394	A
in uh warfare or any type- or any other kind of uh international	2394	A
to go against the to exactly you can't go after the the leader you can't legally do that i mean then again you know there's people who say war is war everything's fair	2394	A
but that's just not it's it's like some you know a Geneva convention or something like that said it	2394	A
uh-huh	2394	A
yeah	2394	A
but	2394	A
yeah it's it's but it's it's it's it's very hard to deal with people that don't believe- don't believe in the same things and don't live the same way that you do you know it's like as we think that	2394	A
Saddam Hussein ruined the country and that	2394	A
that that Iraq would be much better with a democracy so that the people could decide what they want	2394	A
but then again you got you have all the Palestinians that that think that this Saddam Hussein is is a you know is a God is is- is someone that's going to relieve them of all their troubles and how can you get across to people that	2394	A
think that you know their savior you're telling them_1 that their savior	2394	A
is a person of empty promises you can't you know it's hard it's hard to do that so it's hard to change a different- a country especially in the Middle East which has different views on life	2394	A
getting him out yeah	2394	A
uh-huh	2394	A
i think i think the United States should uh stick around and play a role but i don't think that United States should uh get directly involved from now on they should kind of stay stay on the outside of uh	2394	A
of the events you know kind of	2394	A
i don't know how to say it- how to say it exactly in words but you know just kind of stay with one eye looking in the situation make sure that	2394	A
United States can go in when need be you know it's not like uh uh that- we'll be ready if they ever ask for help	2394	A
uh-huh	2394	A
uh-huh	2394	A
so there's already some trouble brewing huh	2394	A
yeah	2394	A
yeah	2394	A
you mean after the cease fire	2394	A
well i think	2394	A
yeah the well i think uh they they also shot down some gunships is that what you're talking about the the uh helicopter gun ships that that they shot down	2394	A
because uh what i heard was that the that the the military was was uh shooting down civilians and and um anti Hussein	2394	A
troops with gun ships	2394	A
it's a mess it's hard it's hard for two different societies to get together and and try to help each other mutually when they don't agree on so many things	2394	A
and then you know and then and especially with the Middle East the way it is they the too -insane you know these these the Arabs are fighting amongst themselves and then one Arab decides to ask	2394	A
a non Arab for help and that just kind of turns everybody else against them_1 like you know that's why the Palestinians were were rooting for or were pulling for Hussein because they're all Arabs	2394	A
and they really didn't like the idea of the United States coming in and helping out Kuwait who was so rich	2394	A
yeah	2394	A
yeah	2394	A
oh well	2394	A
yeah i think we did the right thing	2394	A
right	2394	A
well i think it deterred i think it deterred Hussein from doing anything else because if we- if for example we we let Hussein go in there and take Kuwait then	2394	A
it could have been just like uh you know World War Two because- it may you know because Hitler got little bit of what he wanted here he'd try it again and got some more he'd try again and got some more	2394	A
right	2394	A
right	2394	A
yeah yeah	2394	A
yeah because they don't have anything to lose so they'll go ahead and use them_1	2394	A
um-hum	2394	A
but they have less to lose if they use them_1 you know it's like they're they're third world countries they you know they they're like their their people are in bad shape well we'll go ahead and use it and	2394	A
put some other country in our shape see that's the way they think	2394	A
so	2394	A
yeah	2394	A
it'll be interesting to see how it turns out now you know who who does what if Hussein actually stays in power or not	2394	A
yeah	2394	A
yeah	2394	A
we'll see all right well hey it was nice talking to you	2394	A
yeah you too bye	2394	A
well in the normal in- in the normal route of way we do things how about_1 the ladies go first	2383	B
all right i'm uh live in Plano Texas and uh um	2383	B
uh today we're not even suppose to be in school because the uh the way the taxation and all that crap is there really legally isn't any funding for the school systems in Texas today	2383	B
so uh i mean when you when you take uh	2383	B
uh professionals and put them_1 in situations they have to make decisions based on money to fund public education and they can't get their finger out of their ear long enough to	2383	B
to get that major subject in line something's wrong so i think here in Texas mainly that the the	2383	B
they're not serious they're more serious about what the salary should be for senators than they are for what how the level of education should be for children i have a one year old so i'm not i'm more opinionated about the observations than than the than the true facts but	2383	B
uh it's just a shame to me that- that that the our firemen our policemen and school teachers are the three least paid utilities um that have the biggest impact to our well-being	2383	B
i have a i have a a real issue with that um i think that if from every year when they when they pull in the the the the uh test	2383	B
that the last three years you know ten eleven twelve year uh graders take and and and you see that their their education is below the norm throughout of all fifty states then that's saying that something's wrong with the educational system here in Texas and i have a real concern with about that	2383	B
um um matter of fact i'm very content to send my daughter out- out of state to college in in Virginia uh verses having her go down here and not learn anything and then uh so i'm	2383	B
my my opinion i think- i think there's a big concern uh hopefully- hopefully the new uh education secretary of education will do something to fix the problem but uh	2383	B
i don't know they got to quit worrying about uh the uh religious uh overtones in our textbooks and get on with teaching the product	2383	B
um-hum	2383	B
exactly i- i was astonished to find out that that across the United States in all public schools it is not mandatory for them to take phys ed	2383	B
half- they don't even a lot of the school systems don't even uh the kids nowadays don't even know what what the President's uh Fitness Education Program's all about they don't have to do sit-ups and push-ups and all that crap we had to do when we were going to school	2383	B
and yeah and uh i'll i talked to a thirteen year old last night who's uh goes to uh	2383	B
one of the Plano schools- high schools or or junior highs i guess and she said that that she had a a choice she could either have taken tennis or weight lifting so she chose to take weight lifting	2383	B
over the regular gym i mean give me a break i mean the- the- the kids sit there and they drink- and they drink Cokes and eat popcorn for for for lunch- for lunch and then go out there and lift weights	2383	B
and don't learn anything it's just a real i have a real problem with the whole system they need to put some sternness back into the into the teachers and let them be able to uh get the old whip out and get some discipline	2383	B
um-hum	2383	B
i used to	2383	B
i used to date a girl who taught English at ninth grade level	2383	B
i mean i was absolutely flabbergasted at what she they would- that she was paid true she was young you know but still it's the principle of course if she got her Master's degree it'd all be different but uh	2383	B
oh taxes lord forbid- forbid- lord forbid taxes goodness gracious if we would uh plan our expressways a little better that ten dollars for the bridges and the roads we'd cut that in half and give to the teachers we might have such a problem	2383	B
maybe i should run for office huh	2383	B
this is true	2383	B
that's funny that's funny	2383	B
well that's about all i have here	2383	B
yes ma'am	2383	B
surely i've enjoyed it bye bye	2383	B
{alrighty} um	2383	A
well i uh have- have a four year old who will just be entering public school next year so i'm really just starting to get involved in uh in what's out there and how they do things um	2383	A
as- as far as the system as a whole i really don't see a a problem with it i do see a problem with graduating people that that can't read and are not	2383	A
you know productive in society or productive to themselves and uh i think that's the main problem at this point	2383	A
how about_1 yourself	2383	A
uh-huh	2383	A
right	2383	A
uh-huh	2383	A
that's true	2383	A
uh-huh	2383	A
yeah i think they get bogged down in a lot of small issues that people you know special interest groups can blow up	2383	A
and uh and not really get down to teaching what's important	2383	A
teaching these kids you know how really the basics is what it comes down to	2383	A
is that right	2383	A
huh	2383	A
i remember	2383	A
and talk yeah	2383	A
huh	2383	A
yeah then it comes down to what you said before though about them being uh some of the lowest paid public you know public service	2383	A
employees that there are and yet they're so important	2383	A
uh-huh	2383	A
right	2383	A
well you know it's hard though because then you start talking taxes and uh that's bad word	2383	A
there's an idea	2383	A
run on that then no income taxes in Texas huh i'm in Texas too so	2383	A
well gee	2383	A
well me too i uh i think we both agree there's some problems there but	2383	A
we'll small- maybe do our small part to fix them_1 up	2383	A
all right you too bye	2383	A
personally i do not care for them	2399	B
uh although i find them a necessity in business and so forth i i try to refrain from their use as much as possible	2399	B
um	2399	B
for a number of reasons	2399	B
one of which is the you know extreme interest rate on most of them	2399	B
the one i use uh of course for mostly only for business purposes is uh you know American Express	2399	B
and uh	2399	B
i'm not	2399	B
i'm not terribly in favor of them not for my own personal uh point of view	2399	B
plus it uh has you know from an economic point of view it has increased our	2399	B
debt	2399	B
um	2399	B
tremendously	2399	B
to the tune of somewhere on the order of five to ten billion i believe is number uh at least that's one number for this range of numbers i have i have heard	2399	B
do you use them frequently or	2399	B
uh-huh	2399	B
yes	2399	B
uh-huh	2399	B
i find the one i use mostly uh	2399	B
aside from the American Express i do use	2399	B
my Sears card	2399	B
uh	2399	B
but	2399	B
uh	2399	B
i try as with the American Express i try to pay it	2399	B
you know as it comes in	2399	B
so uh	2399	B
i know when i travel or when i used to travel overseas quite a bit what i would do on my American Express card	2399	B
is	2399	B
before i would before i left	2399	B
i would mail a check to to American Express	2399	B
and	2399	B
you know have some idea of how much was there you know i'd sent them you know several hundred dollars or whatever	2399	B
i felt i would spend	2399	B
and then use it then	2399	B
but uh you know for hotels and and so forth but uh	2399	B
but i knew that it was paid i knew	2399	B
i knew that i had that much credit going in sometimes you know sometimes i would go over but uh	2399	B
it wouldn't you know it wouldn't hit me in a big in a big way because i knew that uh i would have it covered in that respect	2399	B
uh-huh	2399	B
well i found you know i found in um	2399	B
in traveling overseas	2399	B
that uh	2399	B
often	2399	B
it would uh it would expedite things to have an American Express credit card	2399	B
for uh for hotel bills and so forth	2399	B
plus i would uh	2399	B
when they	2399	B
uh	2399	B
would send the bill and they would automatically convert	2399	B
to the	2399	B
exchange rate	2399	B
so	2399	B
now the only time- time that got to be a problem was if the exchange rate changed drastically	2399	B
uh for example i remember on one trip to France	2399	B
when i started planning the trip	2399	B
i think uh	2399	B
a dollar was worth nine or ten francs	2399	B
and just in a matter of a week or two	2399	B
the dollar fell against the franc drastically and when- when i finally got over there	2399	B
it had fallen uh two or three francs to the dollar so the	2399	B
so	2399	B
i got caught a little short in that regard but uh	2399	B
uh i i was anticipating you know my room would cost uh	2399	B
let's say if it were	2399	B
say sixty or seventy francs a night	2399	B
that would mean it would be about ten dollars or so	2399	B
or maybe twenty dollars- maybe it would be more than that it was more than	2399	B
it would average out to thirty five or forty dollars a night which is a reasonable rate	2399	B
but then	2399	B
when i got back and i was working for the government at the time	2399	B
uh of course the government was several months behind on their per on its per diem for exchange rate	2399	B
so there's a little consternation you know in trying to uh get them to compensate for the uh for the difference in the exchange rate	2399	B
that that was the only time i really got caught short and i	2399	B
but as i said most most of all i try not to use them uh to any you know lavishly in that regard	2399	B
and it yeah yeah	2399	B
well from where are you calling	2399	B
so you're from Dallas- okay i'm from Maryland	2399	B
yeah	2399	B
no i work for GTE	2399	B
yes	2399	B

oh thank you very much but uh	2399	B
as Jack said i'm one of the uh	2399	B
the old hands in the speech business i- i've i've uh yes i i've been doing it for twenty some odd years	2399	B
and so uh uh i was very much interested in uh getting involved in uh switchboard	2399	B
so	2399	B
uh you work for TI	2399	B
oh really oh	2399	B
i guess we're supposed to do this part of it before we started the recording	2399	B
okay	2399	B
right	2399	B
well all right	2399	B
okay fine well you have a good evening	2399	B
it's been pleasant talking to you	2399	B
take care	2399	B
good night	2399	B
okay um let's see how do you feel about credit cards	2399	A
uh-huh	2399	A
right	2399	A
right	2399	A
yeah	2399	A
right	2399	A
wow	2399	A
wow	2399	A
well we uh me and my wife when	2399	A
when we have like extra money that we know we're going to have and we can put it in our budget	2399	A
yeah we'll we'll use it but like last year i think we paid um i think it was like twenty something cents interest	2399	A
on our Visa	2399	A
and i think this this year we	2399	A
uh i think we used it for Christmas and we got caught just a few days on our grace period	2399	A
and uh so we'll pay a little interest this year but maybe two dollars but we don't like to do that at all	2399	A
and you know we i think we feel about the same way you do real strongly	2399	A
we uh we have several credit cards though	2399	A
um we have a gas card our Visa and then of course the American Express	2399	A
and i think we have a couple of department stores	2399	A
but we use it the same way and uh	2399	A
uh-huh	2399	A
right right	2399	A
it's it's not uncommon for us to have paid it before we even get the bill that's usually how we do it	2399	A
uh-huh	2399	A
uh-huh	2399	A
yeah	2399	A
yeah	2399	A
right	2399	A
yeah	2399	A
yeah	2399	A
right	2399	A
right	2399	A
well that's good i've	2399	A
i don't think we've gone that far we've been before to pay it in advance- you know in advance before we spend it but	2399	A
i guess if you foresaw that you were going to have to use it that like that that may be good	2399	A
uh-huh	2399	A

my husband was just running out the door he's working at night tonight so i decided to do it i haven't talked before	2386	B
uh what subjects have you talked about	2386	B
well that's interesting	2386	B
it's more interesting than the treadmill and the bicycle right	2386	B
oh my goodness	2386	B
they really have a lot of variety	2386	B
oh a a school administrator well that could that would have been interesting	2386	B
really well that's neat	2386	B
um	2386	B
hm	2386	B
how long is this going to go on do you know	2386	B
i don't either it's interesting though i never heard of such a project before	2386	B
pardon me	2386	B
oh i don't know i guess my husband got a letter at the office	2386	B
i i presume and they must have been asking does your husband work with TI	2386	B
oh really	2386	B
uh-huh	2386	B
are you a	2386	B
oh so they wanted any anybody don't have to work at TI	2386	B
well that's interesting i had no idea that was just for the employees and i couldn't understand i kept getting these calls i thought it was an advertisement and they just were also called TI you know there is Texas Industries and different things	2386	B
i kept hanging up on them for days until my husband told me what it was	2386	B
i didn't know	2386	B
yeah they	2386	B
really	2386	B
oh	2386	B
well the prizes are pretty nice the uh he brought a booklet home and depending on how many calls i think three was the minimum but it went up to i don't know nine or ten how many calls have you made- had	2386	B
well it sounds like a lot	2386	B
oh my and some of the prizes were you know pretty nice but i didn't	2386	B
oh i wish i had that booklet here oh i think i do it's right here uh	2386	B
i'll look at the end because those would be the best ones okay	2386	B
uh	2386	B
well they have some watches that look really nice there's a one that's got some diamonds on it	2386	B
well	2386	B
it says F i haven't quite figured that out i thought it was eight or nine but seems like too nice a prize for nine just nine calls doesn't it	2386	B
it says	2386	B
when we have enough calls from you you will receive in the mail a numbered certificate for your calls and and explanation how to redeem	2386	B
for gifts are you listening to him	2386	B
okay it says	2386	B
oh it says three for a B gift five for a C gift et cetera	2386	B
and this only goes up to F	2386	B
so i thought that was somewhere around nine	2386	B
but anyway it's got these beautiful watches on it let me see what else it has a uh	2386	B
uh clock radio that also plays uh	2386	B
uh you know uh	2386	B

uh-huh	2386	B
no	2386	B
yeah	2386	B
that's funny	2386	B
right well if you if you can make yourself do the tread mill i mean gosh that's a good workout	2386	B
uh-huh	2386	B

how many children do you have	2386	B

UTA right here	2386	B
well i'm um	2386	B
going to be certified as an English teacher and an ESL teacher you know English as a second language	2386	B
you're kidding oh that's interesting	2386	B
pardon me	2386	B
it's hard	2386	B
oh no	2386	B
really	2386	B
really how are the other ones	2386	B
i haven't taken any of the exit tests	2386	B
oh yeah before they started all this stuff	2386	B
really hum	2386	B
oh	2386	B
really i didn't know any of this none of my friends have failed the English or the education ones	2386	B
and i really i really ought to take those quickly while i still remember something	2386	B
i know i know i know how are those ESL courses i'm just starting this summer	2386	B
you're kidding	2386	B
uh-huh	2386	B
oh they give you	2386	B
yeah	2386	B
oh oh	2386	B
well Patricia i was just about to get on my tread mill and then i remembered that i didn't make a call last night and i thought i'd make one tonight	2386	A
that's what i did with mine for a long time put it on the handlebars so i can hang them up	2386	A
and sometimes she just flops them all over the seat	2386	A
uh-huh	2386	A
i like it	2386	A
no it's just as boring	2386	A
i read a book while i'm doing it but i was doing that on the exercise bike	2386	A
i feel like i'm getting a little better of a workout and i'm losing more weight on this than i had on the other and my legs you know how okay i'm going to turn forty this summer i was getting all dimpled up	2386	A
and those are going away	2386	A
so that's real good	2386	A
we got it at a little bit of an incline	2386	A
uh this one yeah this is five hundred	2386	A
i know they get cheaper but i don't know uh-huh	2386	A
well i hope so	2386	A
yeah i didn't buy it really my husband bought it because we we'd	2386	A
we'd never get out and go walking or anything and we go to the lake and we ski and swim in the summer but	2386	A
besides that uh-huh	2386	A
yeah	2386	A
uh-huh	2386	A
i think your voice sounds familiar	2386	A
where do you work-	2386	A
i wonder if we talked before	2386	A
i'm in Garland	2386	A
you sound like this girl that i talked to about books and we got into movies one night	2386	A
uh-huh	2386	A
let's see education uh social changes that we've seen in the last ten twenty thirty years yeah that one was	2386	A
the most boring one was about what meal would you cook for a sit down dinner	2386	A
the other woman didn't cook too much either right	2386	A
yeah they do i talked to this old woman that was a retired administrator in Ohio one night about education and she was	2386	A
uh-huh she retired but	2386	A
yeah and then one night i talked to these two guys no one night i talked to one guy and then a couple of weeks later i talked to the guy's roommate in Virginia about different things yeah	2386	A
uh-huh one was about painting	2386	A
when was the last time you painted something did you feel like you did a good job did you feel uh	2386	A
rewarded while you were doing it i don't know	2386	A
i don't know	2386	A
hum-um	2386	A
well how'd you find out about it	2386	A
how did you find out about it	2386	A
uh-huh	2386	A
uh-huh i have a friend that had a roommate that worked at TI and she saw it on the computer screen and they made copies of it	2386	A
uh-huh	2386	A
uh-huh	2386	A
uh-huh	2386	A
oh	2386	A
well if you work for TI you're supposed to get a prize is what i heard and if you don't work for them you're supposed to get cash but then on the letter it says cash or prize	2386	A
i don't know gobs	2386	A
this is going on my fourth week to do it	2386	A
well like what tell me	2386	A
yeah	2386	A
for how many calls	2386	A
does it say	2386	A
uh-huh	2386	A
uh-huh	2386	A
<b_aside> you need to start the grill <e_aside>	2386	A
no i'm trying not to he's telling me to start the grill	2386	A
so it's not all stuff that TI makes	2386	A
uh you mean the clocks	2386	A
yeah	2386	A
oh God	2386	A
did they mail that to you or he brought it to you	2386	A
huh	2386	A
yeah so you're bound to find something you want	2386	A
yeah	2386	A
well you know uh	2386	A
well do you know you have a ten limit a	2386	A
ten minute time limit and then well that's okay and then they come on and tell you and they they tell you got five seconds to say good-bye	2386	A
we'll keep talking if we want to come up with something else let's see	2386	A
oh i tried exercise classes and i never would go we find we joined exercising-	2386	A
yeah	2386	A
uh-huh	2386	A
they don't either well	2386	A
well the first one i joined they went out of business and they transferred it to another one that was really far away	2386	A
uh-huh and we were going to do it there was four of us together well then forget that it wasn't near me	2386	A
and then the second time i was going to do it at Richland College and we i just get with another friend and we'd end up just smoking cigarettes and riding around like we couldn't find the place	2386	A
so my husband's just discouraged me on those things	2386	A
oh yeah my husband said he's never joined a course right and i got one of those Jane Fonda workout tapes that i dubbed from a friend that didn't last long i got one of those after i had a baby i think	2386	A
definitely two	2386	A
oh Lord you're lucky well i've got a stepdaughter she's in college	2386	A
so there's where the money goes	2386	A
where's you kids-	2386	A
two	2386	A
we	2386	A
uh	2386	A
where you going to school	2386	A
and what are you doing	2386	A
yes i do i just got my certification huh-uh	2386	A
the test is a booger it the test the exit test it's hard it is so hard	2386	A
see i didn't have to take any other exit test because i've been teaching for quite a while	2386	A
but i've heard they're terrible	2386	A
bilingual is just horrendous i've had friends fail that twice	2386	A
good	2386	A
yeah right after you get out	2386	A
boring and they really don't help you a whole lot now see i went to ET and i took one course through TWU	2386	A
but	2386	A
most of the good training i've got has been through Dallas just teaching ESL see i'm a Chapter One Teacher and some of my classes are ESL	2386	A
uh i guess being here in Dallas are you familiar with the Rangers	2319	A
okay	2319	A
i see what team do you follow	2319	A
i see	2319	A
okay okay that's interesting	2319	A
i guess really though i'm a native Texan so that really the about the only team i've ever uh followed has been the Rangers	2319	A
and uh uh what do you think Milwaukee's going to do this year	2319	A
is that right	2319	A
sort of a building season- season yeah	2319	A
shoot the Rangers i don't know what the there's no telling what they'll do they'll probably-	2319	A
uh they won't do anything until the all star break and then uh then they'll perk up a little bit and that seems to be their uh their average pace but	2319	A
yeah uh i heard that but i heard on uh uh the radio this morning that that uh	2319	A
you know old Bobby Valentine said that there was no no uh truth to that but you never can tell	2319	A
that's right and i don't know personally i'd like to get rid of him i think he's sort of a showboat and really hadn't produced you know a whole lot but uh	2319	A
right	2319	A
yeah when they're going to have to spend some money and i think build up their pitching staff uh	2319	A
yeah it would be interesting to see how he does this year	2319	A
yeah i heard uh just i guess last night they got beat uh and Bobby Witt was the pitcher and he's supposed to be uh you know their their hot guy	2319	A
and uh sounded like he got pounded pretty hard	2319	A
yeah	2319	A
right and and that's really what the Rangers need some some consistency you know outer starter	2319	A
and uh uh i don't know it's going to be interesting	2319	A
uh my at work my boss got season tickets this year	2319	A
so uh hopefully if i'm real nice to him he's going throw a couple of those my way every now and then so it will be fun to go out there and watch them	2319	A
that's what they said that uh he really worked out you know hard in off season and uh maybe he can catch a fly ball or two this year	2319	A
right God he need to i mean he's got all the talent in the world when it comes around to to hitting the baseball	2319	A
but uh i mean you got to be a total player when you're in the pros	2319	A
yeah	2319	A
yeah uh i don't know	2319	A
is that right	2319	A
well that's what it takes to uh because uh	2319	A
right to to actually be a leader uh a team leader	2319	A
and uh you know the Rangers really don't have any star players besides Ryan that uh i think the other players look up to	2319	A
because Incaviglia i don't think you know uh he stands out to be a a real leader	2319	A
right right sounds like they have a young guy that they're putting a lot of weight into uh that Juan Gonzalez yeah	2319	A
yeah so it be interesting to see you know i think and make him progress and uh get him on board	2319	A
and then he'll become an all star	2319	A
that's right	2319	A
that's exactly right	2319	A
but uh	2319	A
well i'll tell you what it will be interesting to to get the baseball season going and see how everything turns out	2319	A
i don't know i tell you what they've uh they've got a big enough payroll they need to uh uh	2319	A
go back	2319	A
that's exactly right	2319	A
yeah and i i just don't see uh you know a baseball player being worth that	2319	A
or any really any pro pro athlete because we look at that compared to what uh normal people make i mean it's just totally outrageous	2319	A
and uh	2319	A
yeah -that that that's what ticks me off about old uh Henderson you know wanting to renegotiate- renegotiate his contract because uh uh he's not the highest paid player anymore	2319	A
well man that's that's just ridiculous	2319	A
right	2319	A
exactly and you know ultimately the the consumer and the uh fan are the people that have to pay for it through the	2319	A
right and through advertisements you know on TV uh because a TV contract is really where they rake in the money and	2319	A
right that's right	2319	A
exactly and uh	2319	A
you know so i i don't know personally uh you know i'll pay keep paying whatever the ticket prices are but	2319	A
and uh it really does irk me to see those guys out there uh you know making that much money	2319	A
and uh and then the the public you know just continues to you know help support and funnel the funds into uh to make it happen whatever it costs	2319	A
right	2319	A
well that's right you can get your your fill just about	2319	A
right	2319	A
right right	2319	A
so uh	2319	A
oh really	2319	A
oh yeah	2319	A
oh jeez	2319	A
golly	2319	A
oh man that's ridiculous	2319	A
oh man that makes it tough on the the whole club the management all the way down the rest players	2319	A
yeah	2319	A
right right	2319	A
well it will be interesting	2319	A
i sort of am too uh i enjoy going out to a couple of the games and and uh	2319	A
i really don't get that involved until the play-offs though uh	2319	A
you know the season's just so long	2319	A
right	2319	A
that's right depending on what night it is and where they're at uh on whose playing	2319	A
and uh	2319	A
right	2319	A
right right	2319	A
well i tell you what i appreciate the conversation and uh we'll just have to watch and see how it goes comes about	2319	A
all righty we'll-	2319	A
we'll talk to you later bye-bye	2319	A
uh somewhat they're not my favorite team but uh yeah i am uh somewhat familiar with them	2319	B
i follow the Milwaukee Brewers mostly	2319	B
basically because- because that's where i came from and uh grew up following them as a kid	2319	B
okay	2319	B
well uh	2319	B
i don't think they're going to challenge for the lead in the east	2319	B
uh they they've got a lot of uh rebuilding to do	2319	B
they traded for a lot of new players uh in in the off season and it looks like it might help them but uh i think this is going to be a year for pulling together and looking for the future	2319	B
yeah uh-huh	2319	B
well there's been some talk that they're going to trade Pete Incaviglia	2319	B
okay	2319	B
they might just be fishing to see what they can get for him	2319	B
yeah	2319	B
yeah i agree they're paying him too much money and uh for- for the kind of money they're paying him right now i think it's one point six million dollars they can get a pretty good quality outfielder	2319	B
yeah i'm looking forward to seeing Nolan Ryan pitch	2319	B
but uh	2319	B
i think the rest of the staff is uh a little weak	2319	B
right	2319	B
he's hot and cold	2319	B
he'll have an outstanding outing and the next time he'll get shelled	2319	B
so	2319	B
yeah	2319	B
i see	2319	B
i guess Ruben Sierra's got an entirely new attitude this season	2319	B
he claims to be out there to play ball	2319	B
yeah they say he's really been hustling	2319	B
never	2319	B
yeah	2319	B
well i felt a little guilty but not much when uh Robin Yount won the MVP instead of Sierra	2319	B
the other year	2319	B
but uh Yount has been a he's he's a player uh year in year out and always uh is leading the team in uh most of most of their offensive categories	2319	B
he really is a team player	2319	B
yeah	2319	B
Sierra hasn't shown that kind of maturity yet	2319	B
yeah and he hasn't really shown the the talent uh or the promise that they saw when he was at Oklahoma State	2319	B
Juan Gonzalez	2319	B
yeah he looks to be a a up and coming uh performer	2319	B
well given the Rangers' history they'll probably trade him	2319	B
and then he'll	2319	B
right somewhere else	2319	B
that that seems to be the way the Rangers operate	2319	B
how do you think Oakland's going to do	2319	B
for what they're paying they ought to get they ought to get the performance out of those guys uh	2319	B
Canseco's making five million a year	2319	B
yeah	2319	B
yeah i i agree	2319	B
i think it is and when when the players themselves are turning down contracts that are three or four years in duration for three or four million dollars a year looking for more money yet	2319	B
sure	2319	B
well it's it's a bidding war between teams and it's also popularity contest between sports to see who can get the biggest uh paycheck	2319	B
because baseball	2319	B
that's true they keep raising the ticket prices every year	2319	B
yeah and with what those guys get paid then they go out uh besides baseball and and advertise products or they they charge ten or fifteen dollars for a autograph	2319	B
they've got all this supplemental income coming in as if they aren't making enough already as uh stars of the sport	2319	B
yeah	2319	B
sure yeah i might get to maybe one game out of the year uh in person uh but uh having cable TV and HSE	2319	B
yeah i'll watch quite a few games on TV	2319	B
especially to somebody like Nolan pitch	2319	B
Brewers always have such hard luck Teddy Higuera is hurt again	2319	B
he was supposed to pitch an exhibition in Mexico against Fernando Valenzuela	2319	B
and uh he had a torn rotator cup	2319	B
so he's out for at least uh oh i don't know how many weeks or months they said	2319	B
but he may not pitch this season again	2319	B
but he's the star of that uh team their pitching staff and when he sits out they fizzle	2319	B
that seems typical because most of their other stars uh Paul Molitor's usually out half the season with injuries himself	2319	B
yeah they end up juggling the lineup and trying to fit uh more inexperienced players into those roles and they just don't have the leadership don't have the skills to carry a team	2319	B
well i think it will be fun i'm ready for baseball season to start	2319	B
yeah ah i agree with that	2319	B
right well the preseason really doesn't mean anything either	2319	B
because the players- the teams uh usually play in split squads and they're either playing their rookies or their uh	2319	B
uh	2319	B
yeah	2319	B
so once the season gets underway you know they're out there to be serious about what they're doing trying to win games and uh	2319	B
i take it from there	2319	B
okay well good luck to the Rangers this season see if they can pull one out	2319	B
all right sure thanks bye	2319	B
okay do you want to go first	2382	A
fitness and exercise	2382	A
okay um i like to do uh weight training and and cycling	2382	A
and just walking uh and swimming i- i used to do a lot of basketball and running and volleyball until i had some knee surgery last fall	2382	A
and the doctor said that running and jumping isn't real good for my knee anymore so i had to kind of change my lifestyle a little bit	2382	A
thirty eight	2382	A
uh well the the rest of me is in pretty good shape it's just that left knee that just doesn't want to do everything it used to	2382	A
really	2382	A
ooh	2382	A
oh i bet that helps	2382	A
um-hum	2382	A
yeah	2382	A
yeah	2382	A
that's right that's right	2382	A
that's right	2382	A
well i mean if if you know what your routine is you can do that by yourself and you probably do	2382	A
this is true	2382	A
well now at	2382	A
i can believe that have you tried the uh the pool at the Spring Creek Fitness Center	2382	A
yes	2382	A
it is they keep it at eighty one degrees year-round	2382	A
um a fair a fairly a fairly good amount uh more on the weekends uh i try to beat the traffic in the mornings when i workout in the mornings i try to come down to the Dallas Fitness Center	2382	A
um have you done your attitude survey for this year yet	2382	A
you need to put that on there seriously	2382	A
oh you don't	2382	A
oh	2382	A
yeah	2382	A
yeah	2382	A
this is true	2382	A
yeah	2382	A
well it's not a	2382	A
now what year are we talking about	2382	A
okay uh things have become much more enlightened since then	2382	A
yeah you know we still don't have day care facility but people are more sympathetic to it	2382	A
yes yes	2382	A
ooh	2382	A
my gosh	2382	A
could you hold the phone for one second thanks	2382	A
okay i'm back	2382	A
wow	2382	A
of course it's real easy to take care of the first one when you're on your back	2382	A
really	2382	A
yeah	2382	A
yeah	2382	A
yeah really	2382	A
yeah	2382	A
there you go	2382	A
i- i can believe that	2382	A
oh yeah flex time is great	2382	A
i- i can understand i can understand well it's been good talking with you	2382	A
yeah	2382	A
oh shoot it's only about ten bucks a month	2382	A
yeah i mean uh to add dependents is is you know maybe another dollar or something it's no big deal	2382	A
yeah	2382	A
uh you do for classes for classes but to i mean to use any of the facilities is is no extra charge	2382	A
yeah it is	2382	A
well or or a dependent- or a dependent of one	2382	A
really	2382	A
wonderful	2382	A
yeah	2382	A
oh yeah it's great	2382	A
uh well it would depend on when you go it's not it's not excessively crowded on the weekends	2382	A
oh i don't think that would be bad at all if you're in Richardson you'd probably wanted to come to the to the Dallas site	2382	A
oh well then you could go either- either one the Spring Creek one is a lot more modern has a lot more	2382	A
niceties amenities and you'd probably like the pool there	2382	A
well i'm good i'm glad well thank you you have a good day bye-bye	2382	A
well i could barely hear what the switchboard operator was saying as as what was the topic	2382	B
oh God No why don't you go first	2382	B
hm well let me ask a personal question how old are you	2382	B
oh well then you you get the over thirty five everything goes downhill flop	2382	B
oh well you're lucky then because_1 i've battled arthritis all my life i mean even since i was like about two or three that's when they diagnosed it and usually most people are just absolutely crippled and uh i do water aerobics	2382	B
religiously do water aerobics	2382	B
i used to do about six times a week and now i'm down to about four	2382	B
but it's about the only thing that keeps my mobility in shape- in in there uh i tried weight training and i'm telling you you just i just can't lift the things	2382	B
and the shock on the system is is just too much so i have stuck to water aerobics basically you know the weightless thing and	2382	B
trying to keep in shape that way but you know it's hard to find i mean it's really hard to find a place that's going to offer water aerobics because what i'm finding is that if they do offer it you get the crowd of women that are	2382	B
i think they feel this is going to be an effortless sweatless way	2382	B
to get in shape without having to spend anything or it's the geriatric crowd	2382	B
so i've considered even becoming licensed to teach it	2382	B
yeah but you have to have an indoor pool	2382	B
so to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself without you know drawing a lot of looks means you're really going to do a strenuous workout activity you look very odd in the water and that was the one place where i was also able to do weight training	2382	B
and that does look very odd in the water	2382	B
no and you know that's about the only place i haven't tried and people have told me now that's the Texan facility	2382	B
i have been told that thing is just lovely	2382	B
huh have- now do you use that facility a lot	2382	B
hum do you know if they have child care there	2382	B
they don't i don't i don't work at TI	2382	B
no i used to work at TI as matter of fact i was the only woman that they had in the field in a management position actually when i was working there i was the only woman that was pretty much in the industry and i used to fill out those attitude surveys and uh	2382	B
uh me and the uh insurance adjusters- adjusters are are very familiar with each other and my husband still works there and uh	2382	B
i get my attitude expressed through them but i find it to be very sometimes it's kind of shoot yourself in the foot short sided mentality to save a few bucks uh and	2382	B
never having lived in Texas before i started to work for TI and i came down here and you know they did an attitude survey like six weeks after i had been working here and i asked about you know day care for the shift workers and	2382	B
boy i was pulled in by my manager and told that you just don't say that you know and it's not applicable to me and i was kind of horrified	2382	B
we're talking nineteen seventy eight	2382	B
they couldn't have gotten anymore in the dark ages	2382	B
i understand i understand that they're now covering women's preventative health care and uh the reason i'm at home is when i had my kids and i was uh scheduled to go back and i tell you how much in the dark ages it was um	2382	B
i had been rated number one in the field and then i took uh when i became pregnant i also got meningitis and then delivered the first baby three months early	2382	B
and they put the baby on a heart lung monitor when i took her home and the insurance carrier was not going to cover this because it was considered preventative treatment sure	2382	B
and then they used to uh and then i had a second one eighteen months later they told me to put them_1 back to back and of course to maintain	2382	B
and i was flat on my back for the last five months with the second one because_1 that's when i go into labor that's like four and a half months and i don't even know it	2382	B
oh yeah very easy ah very easy and they they put me on twenty four hour fetal monitoring then to to you know to	2382	B
to try to control the labor and see how far it was going and after the baby was born since it wasn't premature then they said they wouldn't cover the cost of the monitor i think that's kind of when my husband hit the roof because it was a uh thirteen thousand dollar	2382	B
bill but after the second baby was born i was going to go back to work and that was when they had God it would have been the eighty five layoff	2382	B
and i'll tell you how they handled this and i was just outraged i did not know that since i was on personal leave of absence that i had been uh terminated	2382	B
until i filed my insurance claims about four months later and they didn't have any coverage under my name and i went back and i said what	2382	B
the hell is going on here you know and they told me that uh oh well you know you know your husband works here and he's got a good salary we didn't think that you'd be coming back anyway and uh	2382	B
you know we've got people here that really you know need to be working and so that we had just you know it was this way we didn't have to layoff an active person and we'd just let you go	2382	B
and it took me about a year of arguing i said you know you've got to put this in writing to me and because until they put it in writing i couldn't get my insurance benefits and i couldn't get my uh termination benefits either	2382	B
i was just pissed as hell that they could do that	2382	B
but i- i guess things have gotten better i've been told that there's flex hour and those kind of things	2382	B
i still don't think that they after my experiences that they could you know get me to go back ever again	2382	B
but let me ask you this since you use Texans how much is it a month	2382	B
now is that for an individual	2382	B
that's it	2382	B
now are if you if you if you pay your your monthly charge do you then pay separately for classes you're taking	2382	B
God that's cheap	2382	B
that's really cheap	2382	B
do you have to be an active TI employee to join Texans or	2382	B
or the dependent on God i am so dependent these days it's offensive to me {alrighty} well i i'm seeing that my my codependents have turned on the hose and are getting my neighbors fence	2382	B
yeah so my uh position from management to domestic goddess has been an adjustment but boy i think i'm going to go contact Texans	2382	B
i really think i am i mean that beats any offer i've heard in a long time	2382	B
huh {alrighty} when you're there on weekends is it crowded as hell	2382	B
see i'd want to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty	2382	B
oh i i'm actually right on the Plano line	2382	B
yeah	2382	B
oh God it sounds like i would i might do that then okay i learned something here	2382	B
you can go back to work now	2382	B
thank you	2382	B
bye-bye	2382	B
well how many credit cards do you have	2313	A
sounds like we have no conflict we had for a while i was carrying one card and my wife was carrying a different one	2313	A
and since the slips all look alike uh you commingle them and then you get the statement and you try to sort them_1 out and it and it uh	2313	A
it it causes more confusion about it i finally said gee this is kind of a waste of time and then when AT&T came along and offered a free one uh i accepted that and we've been using that one	2313	A
uh the interesting thing is is that uh the amount of money you can can run up on them i don't know do you know any people that run up big big bills	2313	A
well did um were you able to get one while you're in college	2313	A
just curious because_1 i have a son that's a senior this year and he's heading off with any kind of luck but there has been i've had a couple of ads for a for for to provide a card for a college student	2313	A
uh what do you think about the idea of providing one for somebody like that	2313	A
well that that that i guess from the from the card issuer uh that since since it's it's in monitor- the parent gets it for them that really the parent becomes the one that's responsible but it's	2313	A
yes it's whether the parent wants to take the risk	2313	A
yeah to to go run up a big bill and the thing is there some there some advantages if he got off some place and stranded i i'm i'm leaning towards doing it for for convenience-	2313	A
a convenience	2313	A
yeah and the idea that you know if he got in trouble there's some some ways of getting out and that he doesn't have to carry cash	2313	A
the uh i i like the idea of credit cards that uh i don't i don't i don't carry cash around and and uh i don't even carry checks around i let my wife take the checkbook and-	2313	A
she writes the checks and i record them so it's uh	2313	A
it's uh it's but it's interesting that uh the people that can that can uh the amounts of money you can run up with-	2313	A
on on credit cards and uh i i had recently had some dealings with a fellow that they had run up he was making oh considered a modest salary for an engineer	2313	A
and he had run up uh more than a years salary in in various debts to	2313	A
and he wound up declaring bankruptcy but there it it's hard to believe that you'd run up twenty thirty thousand dollars of	2313	A
uh well it was a combination of things he had uh there were	2313	A
there were several credit cards and then there were several other businesses but uh i i guess what's interesting have you seen the uh the the the the ads where they're offering to extend payments on	2313	A
uh things like uh like the credit union's offering	2313	A
yes	2313	A
yeah	2313	A
the interesting thing about that is is that uh that that they're encouraging you to incur more incur more debt and	2313	A
and they make more money if you extend your loan	2313	A
yes	2313	A
and they know that people own a car that new unless absolutely dire circumstances or anything- they're not going to keep on if the car were older	2313	A
the interesting thing about it is is that from a uh uh an economy standpoint or in economics i i thinks it's i think it's poor poor uh economics to to carry all that consumer debt	2313	A
at least from a tax standpoint so	2313	A
it's interesting that that the American public is encouraged to incur all that debt and then next year none of it will be deductible and this year it's ten percent or so	2313	A
it's uh it's interesting that that uh they encourage us to do things	2313	A
i think ten percent yes of your of your consumer credit	2313	A
oh if you had a thousand dollars that means there's another hundred dollar deduction i've given you	2313	A
yeah it's on uh yeah	2313	A
yeah on the uh there's there's there's a place for consumer debt and then you take ten percent of it on the	2313	A
oh okay	2313	A
it's on it's on schedule um	2313	A
schedule a under uh	2313	A
well it's the same place it's the same place you put uh interest but but see that's what that's what makes Texas squirrelly laws that uh you can't you can't take out a a second mortgage	2313	A
uh like some states where you can take out the mortgage and declare that and so uh it's fully deductible the laws are a little squirrelly but it basically comes down to it's not in your best interest to borrow money from a tax standpoint	2313	A
but uh	2313	A
anyway	2313	A
sounds like you're you're very responsible- very financially responsible it's uh	2313	A
that's uh there're a lot of people who really run my boss drives quite a ways to work and he's got just enormous debts and he's	2313	A
uh but i mean what do you say it's like shucks boss i'm sure sorry you've got all that debt well he's had had two kids in college and and this kind of thing and that	2313	A
i think that the whole credit card issue i think they certainly encourage people to run up the debts and but i agree with you i don't i try to limit my debts well i did buy a new house last summer that	2313	A
it's it's remarkable how many people as soon as they get out of college buy a new car and that uh apparently that's been going on for a really long time i didn't do it i i bought a second hand car when i was the middle of my senior year	2313	A
yep	2313	A
miscellaneous things like food -and and other things these habits you get into eating and and uh it's it's it's amazing how it what you learn	2313	A
well anything else good to say about credit cards	2313	A
i might just	2313	A
you don't have to carry the cash and and uh and it's it's it's certainly accepted more places than the places you know it's hard to cash a check if you're out of state and	2313	A
yeah	2313	A
they don't allow they don't do that-	2313	A
yeah huh	2313	A
carry all that cash with you	2313	A
well you know they they	2313	A
they've started towards a little bit of the debit card have you seen the debit cards where they actually debit your account when you	2313	A
yeah and i think that's where	2313	A
yeah i've seen a couple although the so many of the grocery stores don't do that because of the the time frame which they get paid	2313	A
in general that uh they i've seen checks deposited the very next day i mean cleared my account the next day my wife will write a check for groceries and	2313	A
you know almost well i guess it's the day after uh technically it's two days but they- they- they took that check and scurried it to the bank and the bank scurried it back to my account and you thought there'd be just a little bit of float but apparently that's why the uh	2313	A
the uh the uh grocery stores are reluctant to do that because their volume that is quite high and they have uh	2313	A
the profitability of the cash flow is a big issue for them so	2313	A
anyway well it's good talking to you	2313	A
maybe we'll get across we'll cross paths again good night	2313	A
um	2313	B
i've only i've got about four maybe	2313	B
i try to limit them because i well one i don't use them	2313	B
uh too much and i use my Visa just for about- for about everything and i pay it all off	2313	B
so i try not to i just use it for free money for thirty days basically	2313	B
i'm i'm you know i'm in the age group you get out of college and i think a lot of these people have them {maxed} out	2313	B
um i don't think i ever tried	2313	B
um	2313	B
well	2313	B
yeah i i you know it's	2313	B
you know feasible i mean i know a lot of college kids who have them you know who had them but	2313	B
just depends	2313	B
yeah so basically if you want to take the risk	2313	B
it's your risk	2313	B
do you trust your your son	2313	B
uh-huh	2313	B
uh-huh i'd say do you know	2313	B
have one with you know at least a thousand dollar credit limit or something	2313	B
yeah	2313	B
uh-huh	2313	B
the the extended loan payment for your car	2313	B
yeah i saw that	2313	B
well it's it's it's business and they're making money off that	2313	B
yeah and and it's so it's business so and you notice that they're they're only going to do it to like cars that are one or two years old	2313	B
and so they've already shifted the risk if they assume that car then they just have to sell it themselves and they'll recover the loan	2313	B
uh-huh	2313	B
yeah	2313	B
yeah uh	2313	B
what now what's ten percent we can deduct	2313	B
i didn't know that	2313	B
i didn't think you could anything on a loan or	2313	B
i mean a mortgage i know you can	2313	B
oh i've never itemized yet	2313	B
so maybe that's	2313	B
schedule a or	2313	B
yeah	2313	B
yeah i try i i really do i just try to stay out of debt and i and i use my Visa for for as much as i can and i pay it all off and	2313	B
uh-huh	2313	B
uh-huh	2313	B
yeah	2313	B
yeah	2313	B
and i took a five year note out on my car when i right when i got out of college and uh	2313	B
i'll never do that again i still got a couple of years on it to go and i'm	2313	B
uh-huh	2313	B
well you you think you're starting out well until you start paying all those bills uh apartment rent and	2313	B
yeah well	2313	B
yeah and and-	2313	B
yeah so	2313	B
um	2313	B
yeah they're they're convenient you know that's that's a	2313	B
probably one big thing about them and	2313	B
uh	2313	B
uh-huh	2313	B
yeah well i was used to using my credit card like at Skaggs Alpha Beta in Dallas and stuff and now i'm out here in Phoenix	2313	B
uh	2313	B
they they none of these grocery stores take any credit cards so now i have to carry cash when i go to the grocery store which is new to me you know i got to have sixty bucks on me or something	2313	B
so uh	2313	B
that was interesting cause i always you know you didn't have to worry about carrying that much unless i knew i	2313	B
yeah i've heard about them	2313	B
that's mostly locally the banks will line up with uh	2313	B
yeah	2313	B
all righty	2313	B
all righty	2313	B
take it easy	2313	B
okay	2317	B
what kind of hobbies do you have	2317	B
uh-huh yeah	2317	B
uh-huh	2317	B
oh	2317	B
uh-huh	2317	B
well i sew	2317	B
clothes you know	2317	B
that's like a hobby because i don't ever make anybody nothing but me	2317	B
or maybe little kids i've i've done weddings but not not- not big weddings like you know	2317	B
big big weddings just bride's maid's dresses and stuff like that for people that i know	2317	B
you know so	2317	B
i don't want to be paid to do it because_1 then it becomes a job and then it's not a hobby you know	2317	B
and a lot of stress too	2317	B
you know especially i don't want to do this and i don't want to do that so it's then it's not a hobby it's more of a job but i like to sew you know it calms me down	2317	B
oh yes and then i go ballooning	2317	B
hot air-	2317	B
no hot i go hot air ballooning	2317	B
yeah in a hot a hot air balloon-	2317	B
in a hot air balloon	2317	B
yes now that's fun	2317	B
and uh well i don't i don't own a balloon but i crew for a guy he owns two balloons	2317	B
and he'll call us up and say let's go and so we'll meet you know real early in the morning people think we're crazy because_1 we get up so early in the morning but i love it	2317	B
and i always tell people if you ever go up in one you just that's it you be hooked	2317	B
and they're so pretty and you know	2317	B
well you don't have a choice	2317	B
well you don't have a choice of where you're going	2317	B
so when you get ready to come down you have to you know you- it's more or less like letting the air out he can land more or less where he wants to it's just that there's no like if he wanted to go one place he would have to know which way the wind is blowing	2317	B
yeah that's just Plano they have Plano festival	2317	B
uh	2317	B
let's see now i think we're on number eight or tenth we're almost to number ten i think because_1 i've been here ten years	2317	B
so yeah and then Mesquite is five they do one in Mesquite	2317	B
now that's old that is that is the largest	2317	B
yeah that's the largest one in the world they they have over six hundred balloons	2317	B
um-hum	2317	B
about sixty it's it's getting larger last year i think we had eighty	2317	B
um-hum more people get involved and stuff like that	2317	B
but you have sponsored balloons you know like companies like Coors	2317	B
uh	2317	B
yeah Oldsmobile they all have balloons you know	2317	B
the IBM had one last year now TI don't have one and Rockwell i mean yeah Rockwell they don't have one Rockwell whatever it is	2317	B

yeah	2317	B
yeah now banks they sponsor different banks out here like Bank One sponsored one one year	2317	B
and i can't think of the rest of them_1 but they they you know they have sponsors for certain balloons and all they do is just put the name of the bank or whoever's sponsoring that balloon- that balloon yeah it's pretty good	2317	B
uh	2317	B
oh yeah and it's so peaceful we went out to Texas Stadium one time for a Boy Scout jamboree	2317	B
and we we was inside of the stadium like like i was thinking it the Astrodome	2317	B
and they filled it up the football field	2317	B
and inflated all the balloons	2317	B
and it's it was so pretty that if you got way up at the top it looked like you could just dive off and and and bounce on a bunch of pillows you know it was good it was fun i had fun	2317	B
but that that's my that's probably my main hobby that sewing and reading books that's about it	2317	B

um-hum	2317	B
yeah	2317	B
and you think it's the same but it's really not	2317	B

because_1 you're having fun	2317	B
and	2317	B
yeah i like {jazzercise} i'll tell anybody i'd go to {jazzercise} before i'd go to aerobics	2317	B
yeah i used to belong i i but i stopped that because_1 i never used it	2317	B
you know the the fitness centers so oh well that's a waste of money	2317	B
yeah i'm thinking about it my husband wants he wants to go to- and sign up for the weights	2317	B
so but	2317	B
um-hum and they're open till i think ten	2317	B
yeah so	2317	B

um-hum	2317	B
yep	2317	B
oh yeah	2317	B
um-hum	2317	B
yep	2317	B
my husband likes the weights period that's it he wants to be up like he wants to he says i'm going to pump up i said uh-huh	2317	B
yeah because_1 i'm always looking at those guys i love them_1	2317	B
but i always ask him how come they don't ever have no hair because_1 i've never-	2317	B
yeah they do and i told him i said well if you do it you can't shave your hair	2317	B
i'm sorry i can't handle it	2317	B
um-hum they do and then i don't know how they get because_1 normally they're not that pumped up and i	2317	B
okay	2317	A
well if uh i like to do- i like to make stuffed animals i i sort of have not been doing as much as i did you know before i had to work for real but i like to do things like that and uh	2317	A
you know bottle covers and	2317	A
that sort of stuff and dancing	2317	A
the dancing i've i've kept up with because you know you don't have to	2317	A
well you don't have to get a lot of stuff out you know	2317	A
what do you do	2317	A
oh	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
oh wow	2317	A
um-hum	2317	A
yeah yeah	2317	A
wow	2317	A
yeah and then it then it puts a lot of responsibility on you	2317	A
yeah yeah	2317	A
oh well that yeah	2317	A
yeah i like to sew too but you know if i'm not in the mood to sew i can screw things up like you wouldn't believe	2317	A
yeah and then it lies in a drawer for about five or six years at least	2317	A
oh do you really	2317	A
oh wow how exciting	2317	A
oh i'll bet	2317	A
uh-huh	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
oh that's neat	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
is it is it hard to make it come down where you want to	2317	A
oh it just comes down when it wants to	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
uh-huh	2317	A
right yeah	2317	A
yeah well have you flown in one of those where they have a whole bunch that go you know like up at one time	2317	A
yeah how long have they been doing that	2317	A
oh well that's neat	2317	A
what about that one they do in Albuquerque	2317	A
yeah that's the oldest one isn't it	2317	A
wow	2317	A
how many do they have like at the Plano one usually	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
yeah probably every year it'll	2317	A
yep	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
yeah because_1 those things are pretty expensive aren't they	2317	A
um-hum	2317	A
um-hum	2317	A
yeah i had a friend at TI Detroit a long time ago that had one that a bank	2317	A
you know had sponsored	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
and it looks so pretty when they're all you know when there's a bunch of them_1 that way	2317	A
um-hum	2317	A
um-hum	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
oh	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
wow	2317	A
sounds fun	2317	A
oh i like to read too what kind of books do you like	2317	A
yeah i like those i like mysteries- i like murder mysteries too	2317	A
have you ever read any Dean Koontz	2317	A
he's he's sort of it's he he's writes real good but- usually- it's the kind though that you don't want to start if you have to put it down very soon	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
yeah the he does well they're sort of scary	2317	A
you know but they're they're just really really good	2317	A
The Watchers you know they made a movie of The Watchers here not too long ago	2317	A
and that was a book that he wrote that that was my favorite one it's about this dog named Einstein	2317	A
and this it was- he was an experimental government thing you know	2317	A
and they were trying to do like like robotic stuff and everything	2317	A
yeah yeah well the the book was just ever so much better	2317	A
yeah it was great	2317	A
you like uh uh who is it uh Victoria	2317	A
Victoria Holt is that right	2317	A
yeah those are good i like those	2317	A
oh really	2317	A
well that's i	2317	A
really	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
oh what what what one is that	2317	A
hum	2317	A
yeah yeah usually the the movies are not as good	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
um-hum	2317	A
yeah that's usually the way it is	2317	A
sometimes they just change them_1 completely	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
like Jaws do you remember Jaws- did you	2317	A
yeah the book was a lot better i thought	2317	A
but they just they just	2317	A
well my dancing is i i like to belly dance	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
well you know it's it's real funny because_1 when i first started it was like i saw someone at a Halloween party this lady was from Turkey and she'd been belly dancing since she was four years old you know so i thought well jeez you know that looks like fun i'll learn that in a couple of weeks ha	2317	A
yeah you know i mean you could just you could just take lessons forever- forever i think	2317	A
course i'm tend to be a slow learner i guess anyway but it's a lot of fun and it's it's a good way to get exercise you know fooling yourself because you don't realize you're getting exercise	2317	A
you know it's so much fun you don't really think about it	2317	A
and exercising i mean let's face it exercising stinks	2317	A
oh i go to aerobics classes and stuff but	2317	A
do you	2317	A
are you do- do you are you at TI in Dallas so so you go to the fitness center	2317	A
no	2317	A
oh yeah yeah i well the only time i can go in too and all these classes that are available are like Saturday	2317	A
yeah Saturday morning which is you know i i go to those when i can	2317	A
yeah well they have uh the they have them_1 like at six	2317	A
you know here but i	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
yeah that's a lot of fun	2317	A
well yeah that's the same kind of thing like belly dancing you know you don't really realize that you're working as hard as you are	2317	A
yeah and it's sort of cute too	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
yeah well see i belong to the fitness center so i feel like i have to go to the aerobics class to get my money's worth you know	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
um-hum	2317	A
yeah well it's so neat because it's right there and i can go just right after work and you know before i get home because once i get home that that tends to be it	2317	A
um-hum yeah and yeah that's handy and they're just there you know when you want to use them_1	2317	A
um-hum	2317	A
yeah	2317	A
and i i did the family thing so my sweetie could go too	2317	A
do the weights	2317	A
he'll he'll he would never do an aerobics he'd die before he in aerobics class	2317	A
but he likes the weights and the you know stationary bicycle and all that	2317	A
body build huh	2317	A
um-hum	2317	A
i think they shave it	2317	A
yeah and put	2317	A
and then then oil up i think	2317	A
okay um what do you think about the war recently	2355	A
uh-huh	2355	A
uh	2355	A
the economy the our soldiers going over uh just everything	2355	A
yeah yeah	2355	A
that's the first thing i thought of i don't know	2355	A
right	2355	A
right	2355	A
right and	2355	A
i know that uh i've heard people say that you know when people that went to World War Two	2355	A
you couldn't become a political figure or president unless you had served in the war but then in Vietnam	2355	A
that was totally different you know you couldn't be a political figure if you were in Vietnam probably	2355	A
and now if you've served in Desert Storm you probably would be a a good candidate	2355	A
exactly-	2355	A
exactly exactly	2355	A
oh torn apart oh yeah	2355	A
um-hum	2355	A
right	2355	A
so it that's also a good reason why it it or good that it ended as soon as it did	2355	A
oh okay	2355	A
um-hum	2355	A
exactly and it seems like everything is raising every everything that can be cigarette not that i smoke but cigarettes	2355	A
um uh stamps i mean it seems like ever exactly everything single thing that we do	2355	A
is higher you know	2355	A
and they just raised the minimum wage today but that's not like you know	2355	A
as much as they should have raised it i'm sure	2355	A
but uh	2355	A
uh-huh	2355	A
right	2355	A
right right	2355	A
uh-huh yeah	2355	A
i don't i don't have any children or anything right now i'm uh i work as a	2355	A
news reporter in Waco and so i get to see i got to see a lot of not firsthand but	2355	A
uh probably a good part of the war um as far as what people thought about it and a lot of things like that so	2355	A
it was kind of amazing people were coming to me to ask me	2355	A
you know what's going on you know like i knew or like i sat in on the meetings or something	2355	A
yeah yeah so i got to hear a lot of what the people thought about you know changes in in the war and everything	2355	A
so that was pretty interesting	2355	A
yeah	2355	A
exactly be everything be supermom exactly	2355	A
uh-huh	2355	A
right and	2355	A
where as it would have been exactly um	2355	A
right the roles are changing a lot	2355	A
uh-huh	2355	A
right	2355	A
and even you know i think a lot of the movies we see now	2355	A
kind of kind of play a good part in our changes because you see that they have The Three Men and a Baby type movies	2355	A
and i think you know to yeah and then you have the women	2355	A
uh detectives now and you know different roles just in what we see and so we probably want to do that even more now	2355	A
you know since the women's movement in the well- seventies and you know we've come a long way but i think it's still a still good ways to go	2355	A
so	2355	A
uh-huh	2355	A
right	2355	A
yeah	2355	A
exactly	2355	A
exactly	2355	A
it's just not as	2355	A
exactly but it's i mean like i say we've come a long way but we have i mean twice as far to go still	2355	A
and i don't think a lot of people you know realize a lot the plight of a lot of people	2355	A
you know and you may be in good standing and everything may look hunky-dory to you	2355	A
but there's so many more people exactly that you don't even and that you don't even see or know about	2355	A
oh oh yeah	2355	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2355	A
yeah	2355	A
yeah	2355	A
i grew up in in Brooklyn New York and so i was just i was just surrounded you know by black people because i'm Black and so you know i lived that's where i lived	2355	A
and so now i i feel lucky actually because i've almost lived around everyone i've i went to UT to college and so they you know they have	2355	A
a lot of different people go there different kinds of people and so i feel really enriched in that a lot of people don't get to see you know some people have lived in Lewisville all their life you know and so they don't get to see	2355	A
exactly and that	2355	A
uh-huh	2355	A
uh-huh	2355	A
exactly	2355	A
it is	2355	A
oh my gosh	2355	A
well there's so many people who have never you know even gotten to do that so that's great my sister was telling me	2355	A
she met a girl- she's going to the University of Pennsylvania in in Philadelphia and uh she just met a girl from um i think	2355	A
Barbados or Jamaica or something like that	2355	A
and i mean this girl she had like two outfits that she would just wear all the time and everything and she got some kind of money from her government like five hundred dollars so my sister had to take her shopping and	2355	A
you know show her what to wear show her how to match up colors and i just thought that was so very exciting you know to go and and just witness	2355	A
you know this girl just coming to America type thing you know so you know i would have loved it the opportunity to do that	2355	A
but	2355	A
oh yeah	2355	A
uh-huh	2355	A
they think they have to have everything they have to have the latest cereal about you know just	2355	A
yeah that's ridiculous too when i first moved here i was only thirteen but everyone had a car in school	2355	A
you know and i couldn't and i just couldn't	2355	A
believe you know i was from New York and so you know we rode the bus and if you had a car- yeah	2355	A
exactly and if you had a car there was nowhere to park it anyway or you know it's just	2355	A
you just didn't have a car but then we came here and they had parking lots in the schools and i couldn't understand it you know all the kids had cars and they you know have to have a car	2355	A
so that was	2355	A
yeah yeah right-	2355	A
really or live really close to school and have them walk	2355	A
but uh yeah a lot of changes	2355	A
so	2355	A
i think so	2355	A
okay well it's good it's good talking to you okay bye-bye	2355	A
okay	2355	B
the war you mean in terms of the economy or	2355	B
oh i thought we were going to talk about social changes	2355	B
is that is that what you're kind of directing it oh okay okay well um	2355	B
well i think it's caused a lot of you know	2355	B
big difference between when people had gone to war before like compared to Vietnam because i mean i know that there was so much more support for the soldiers going over and even people that didn't agree with the war still seem to be able to separate that	2355	B
you know and support the soldiers so	2355	B
yeah	2355	B
yeah yeah	2355	B
yeah it would be like a bonus for your image or something	2355	B
yeah it i'm sure it caused a lot of changes in terms of how many families had to have their income	2355	B
just drastically altered we had people down the street that the guy was in the reserves and he was just about ready to go and they have a just had a new baby and uh they would have she would have had to go back to work and	2355	B
i think she said their income would have dropped by like two thirds	2355	B
yeah yeah i think the biggest change that we've seen um in in my life or whatever lately is the economy and things are so tight and like my husband hasn't gotten a raise in two years and you know	2355	B
yeah	2355	B
yeah	2355	B
yeah	2355	B
going to effect too many	2355	B
yeah yeah	2355	B
so that's the hardest thing for us and um we've been trying to kind of maintain traditional lifestyle in the sense of meaning home we have a three year old and a two year old and i'm trying to stay home as long as i can	2355	B
you know so that's a big uh stress i think you know for the social changes in our family	2355	B
oh i see	2355	B
uh-huh	2355	B
yeah yeah well it	2355	B
yeah you have an inside track or something	2355	B
yeah yeah	2355	B
let's see what other social changes in the past ten years oh i guess between men and women i've seen a lot of changes in terms of women feeling like they have to have a career be mom be everything superperson	2355	B
yeah because_1 i know you know i i really get pressure from because_1 i have a career also and i get a lot of pressure from people that you know my colleagues that why am i staying home	2355	B
you know whereas before that never would have happened people would have said why are you going to work	2355	B
so that's kind of a difference for us i think there's more pressure to um	2355	B
not necessarily a negative thing but on my husband to be more involved with the family	2355	B
so he's	2355	B
yeah he's gotten a lot uh you know you see all kinds of men being involved in the housework and taking care of the kids and all but in terms of his amount of hours at work nothing on that has lightened up	2355	B
so it's now he has the pressure too of being super dad and super career and	2355	B
yeah that's true mister mom and	2355	B
uh-huh	2355	B
yeah yeah	2355	B
that's true	2355	B
yeah yeah i think there's still i i know that um i grew up in Chicago in the sixties and was part my family was real liberal and i think there's a lot of um	2355	B
kind of myths that we've come a long way just in terms of our society and race relations and things like that and	2355	B
you know i think there's so much prejudice still there and it's kind of more covert now people used to be more clear and say you know well i believe in this or i believe in that and now	2355	B
you know i think there's still tremendous amount of prejudice but people think oh we're in the nineties we're beyond all that you know	2355	B
yeah yeah	2355	B
yeah	2355	B
but there's so many more people that are homeless and yeah	2355	B
yeah it's real easy to get isolated in your own little community you know because when- when i was growing up in Chicago um we were in a real ethnic neighborhood and there were people from all	2355	B
first generation Chinese German you know all different nationalities and everything and now we're kind of like in Lewisville Miss White Little suburbia you know	2355	B
oh boy	2355	B
yeah	2355	B
yeah	2355	B
oh	2355	B
yeah	2355	B
yeah	2355	B
yeah and that they	2355	B
we lived in a dorm my husband and i met in graduate school at Indiana University and i was ours was uh international coed- you know coed dorm and there were twelve hundred students they're graduate students from all over the world	2355	B
and once we came here it was like gosh i just miss that because it really is exciting to be around people of different	2355	B
yeah yeah	2355	B
oh uh-huh	2355	B
oh	2355	B
yeah yeah	2355	B
oh gosh	2355	B
yeah yeah	2355	B
that is part of the change i think that i've seen probably you know in the past twenty years or whatever is now	2355	B
kids have to have so much i mean i even get caught up in it with our kids even though i buy most of the things at garage sales for their Christmas i mean	2355	B
people have- you know think they're kids have to have five hundred dollars worth of toys	2355	B
oh yeah it's just	2355	B
oh gosh	2355	B
yeah	2355	B
yeah	2355	B
yeah	2355	B
oh	2355	B
yeah no kidding	2355	B
yeah	2355	B
well	2355	B
did we cover it everything	2355	B
okay i guess i'll get back to my laundry	2355	B
you too good luck bye-bye	2355	B
yeah i just bought one so	2326	B
yeah guess so	2326	B
uh Mazda	2326	B
uh price basically	2326	B
price and uh what it	2326	B
all the things it came with for the price i couldn't beat it	2326	B
uh i didn't really look at American cars uh had a couple bad experiences with American cars	2326	B
just not holding up so	2326	B
uh my last car was a foreign foreign made car and it held up real well and the car before that was American and it fell apart so	2326	B
i just decided to go foreign	2326	B
really	2326	B
really	2326	B
hell it comes to trucks though i would probably think to go American because everybody know has got a American made truck	2326	B
they just seemed to be more rugged but uh the cars just seem to fall apart	2326	B
get out there and test drive	2326	B
yeah	2326	B
right	2326	B
i don't know how much going to	2326	B
how much better you're going to get with a Blazer there	2326	B
really	2326	B
oh that's not so bad then	2326	B
right	2326	B
yeah i don't know i haven't been in the now ones that you know they look big on the road some of these uh	2326	B
yeah yeah	2326	B
durability yeah if you got to take it out in the field	2326	B
yeah they show them jumping over those ramps but hey	2326	B
yeah	2326	B
right	2326	B
oh about uh twenty six twenty seven in the city it's a it's a four cylinder	2326	B
and it's kind of a	2326	B
sports coupe guess a little sports car but	2326	B
it- it does pretty good	2326	B
huh	2326	B
yeah i haven't even had a chance i've only had it for about three months i haven't had a chance to take it out on the road	2326	B
i'll probably be heading down your way in uh oh the end of May end of April i guess when school's out	2326	B
i'll have to keep that in mind because uh	2326	B
Roundrock and where	2326	B
Georgetown	2326	B
oh uh	2326	B
yeah i i wanted to get a Mustang i wanted to get a convertible but the convertibles you know they tack on an extra five six grand	2326	B
and it's like i can't see paying that for a	2326	B
for just	2326	B
being able to take the roof down	2326	B
yeah	2326	B
yeah it's like i got and plus the way crime is going around here in the city you know take a knife to it break in	2326	B
yeah i'm sure they're	2326	B
yeah and you tack on the insurance they can add to it because	2326	B
insurance	2326	B
yeah	2326	B
i had a friend that rolled a convertible not too long ago it was a BMW totaled the car he walked out of it though	2326	B
all right i got a meeting to get to so	2326	B
great	2326	B
bye	2326	B
well that should be interesting	2326	A
okay you ready	2326	A
here we go	2326	A
what kind of car did you buy Ralph	2326	A
a Mazda how come you got a Mazda	2326	A
oh	2326	A
you couldn't couldn't find an American built car	2326	A
huh	2326	A
i'll be darned	2326	A
i've had pretty much the i've had pretty much the opposite experience	2326	A
yeah i generally drive a a large Ford super cab you know like one fifty or something and the one time i traded and got something different i got a little Datsun uh king cab	2326	A
it didn't last eighteen months i had had more trouble with that	2326	A
yeah i that's that's probably true i'm getting ready to i think i'm going to trade off the super cab and i'm considering going with either one of those four door S10 Blazers a four door Explorer or four door Jeep	2326	A
but i can't decide which one	2326	A
yeah that's about the only thing to do i'm just i i'm looking for uh fuel economy and and durability and i've got to have some high road clearance we got some property and i need to get out in the pasture a lot	2326	A
but i don't need to haul a pickup as much haul around stuff in the pickup as much as i used to we got an old one there at the ranch we use now	2326	A
but i just got to have something i can get out in the field and of course that truck is only getting like eight to ten miles a gallon maybe twelve on a good day and that just kills me	2326	A
especially a dollar a gallon or more for gas	2326	A
well those small ones uh those little bitty ones i'm going to go with the small one with the two wheel drive i don't really i i haven't had a use for four wheel drive tell you the truth	2326	A
they say they're getting eighteen to twenty in them_1 yeah i've got a friend of mine's got a uh he bought a four door Jeep with the {positrack} rear end instead of the four wheel drive	2326	A
he's getting sixteen to eighteen in town and twenty to twenty two on the road	2326	A
no he's not really and he's not he said he's pretty heavy footed he's clipping along at sixty five or so around there when he can get away with it	2326	A
so i think i could probably stand you know twice the gas mileage	2326	A
it wouldn't hurt my feelings a bit i just don't know if i could stand one that small because i'm fairly large and i've always driven a truck or something	2326	A
i don't know	2326	A
they don't look too bad i just you know i i have have to get in one to find out i just don't know if i could stand you know being cooped up my wife's got uh three old cars of hers she's never sold a car she's bought	2326	A
she has thirty nine Chevy a fifty three and a sixty seven	2326	A
and anytime i drive any of those i just you know it's like being in a coffin i just feel hemmed in i've got to have something fairly large	2326	A
but i think probably- probably my whole problem is going to be trying to find something that will that will blend you know uh fuel economy and and price and uh durability	2326	A
you know the little those smaller trucks	2326	A
yeah i know that's	2326	A
i think it would be fun if you didn't have to pay for the repairs to it	2326	A
but that's what they don't show you when they get you know when they get them off they show them jumping up and down hills and like that but they don't show you the repairs	2326	A
you know the front ends impossible to line up on mine	2326	A
last time i lined my Ford front end up it cost me a hundred and ten dollars	2326	A
so i don't know	2326	A
how you getting gas mileage in your Mazda have you had it long enough to know	2326	A
you do most of your driving you do most of your driving in the city you do most of your driving in the city	2326	A
um well watch it coming down south down when you get through uh round round Georgetown and Roundrock they got a highway patrol that just patrols up and down that thing in those little fast Mustangs	2326	A
he just he just lives out there he makes his living on the road out there	2326	A
Georgetown Georgetown or Georgetown	2326	A
on down through Roundrock he just he just patrols up and down through that area now that's a neat little car	2326	A
those little five little five point oh Mustangs the fast ones	2326	A
oh yeah	2326	A
you can get a sunroof a lot cheaper	2326	A
it's probably more functional	2326	A
i don't think i had a convertible once in college and it was fun when you know during the warm months	2326	A
but God it was miserable during the winter i don't care what they say	2326	A
yeah and those convertible tops used to be three hundred dollars i don't know what they are now probably eight- probably eight hundred by now	2326	A
if you ever roll one that's pretty much it	2326	A
you know that	2326	A
that that that and the windshield post doesn't stop much	2326	A
um	2326	A
you don't give those they don't give those BMWs away	2326	A
those are expensive machines	2326	A
um	2326	A
well think we about done our five minutes	2326	A
okay	2326	A
good talking to you	2326	A
see you later bye bye	2326	A
is all you need	4031	B
i think just one is all you need	4031	B
well we don't right now we're planning on setting one up as soon as i can get some you know some better ideas on how to do that have you used one before	4031	B
hm	4031	B
oh yeah i've heard of that	4031	B
um-hum	4031	B
um-hum	4031	B
have you put money into those categories or what what do you do for that sort of thing	4031	B
um-hum	4031	B
um-hum	4031	B
well do you have any money that you uh specifically set aside for certain savings- uh you know savings objectives	4031	B
i mean where do you put that money	4031	B
um-hum	4031	B
oh yeah	4031	B
um-hum	4031	B
that's probably the key part right there is waiting until you get the money that you budgeted	4031	B
i say that's probably the key part right there is waiting until the money that you've planned for is there what about credit cards do have you do you still use those or	4031	B
is that part of the system to discontinue that	4031	B
um-hum	4031	B
um-hum	4031	B
um-hum	4031	B
right	4031	B
yes	4031	B
yes we are i am and uh we've got some children and uh	4031	B
you know we've just seen the need for well we just moved into a house uh that we're renting and that's gonna	4031	B
yeah yeah it really will so we're you know we're going to have to really take a hard look at our uh expenses and things like that and uh	4031	B
you know really make the dollars uh go a little bit further if we can and we uh had not been paying very much for housing uh since we moved to Dallas in July	4031	B
and uh you know we'd go out to eat on Sunday after church or something like that and i think we're gonna have to kind of watch what we do now because that can add up with five kids	4031	B
huh	4031	A
yeah i pushed a an auto dial um so do y'all have a family budget	4031	A
yeah we um a couple of years ago took a class um that was offered was a guy at our church um called Mastering Your Money by Ron Blue	4031	A
you've you've heard of him it's really- it's been really good we've um we're on a a monthly budget and pretty much we we designed our own um	4031	A
ideas of you know these are some set things that that we know we're gonna spend and um	4031	A
the rest we have in categories but for the most part it's been somewhat discretionary um	4031	A
the like right now a and the next month will probably be a little higher in clothes if we buy for spring and summer and so	4031	A
we may spend a little more there and a little less in another- in another area	4031	A
so um but it's worked really well we've been able to save um	4031	A
you know what we've wanted to save and and uh pretty much been able to do what we've wanted to do and we have some long term um goals that we want to do	4031	A
well we um	4031	A
i i keep the books and i'm the one that writes all the um all the bills and stuff and pretty much um i just know what i have to spend <b_aside> no you may not <e_aside>	4031	A
um i know what i need to spend or what i have to spend and i just try not to spend it i know some people do um envelope- envelope- envelope	4031	A
systems and stuff but i don't find that works real well for me	4031	A
yes we have um we have like a college fund for our kids and we have um a house fund and we have a car fund and	4031	A
uh we put it in a savings account or we have some of it in CD's and stuff but we we take that out every month and then divide it up into the categories that that we have	4031	A
and we also we have a category of of short term goals that we put aside money each month and if we want to like right now we're getting ready to	4031	A
put up a fence and that will come out of there it's money that we haven't budgeted for	4031	A
it- you know things you know things like that and then um	4031	A
that's where it will come from and if we don't have the money in there we have to wait until it's you know up to where we where it needs to be	4031	A
i i'm sorry i didn't- i didn't hear you	4031	A
yeah	4031	A
um	4031	A
well he recommends that you don't um or he helps- he recommends that you you get them_1 down we we've never been real big credit card users and we always pay it off um	4031	A
every month if we use them_1 um we're not real big cash carriers so occasionally we will spend or we will you know put uh a meal on it or um	4031	A
i don't know sometimes i'll do mail order stuff and i'll put it on there but it we always it always- we will always work it out where	4031	A
where we pay it off at the end of the month so we don't put just a whole lot on there we don't use them_1 just real real often except i do use my gas i keep track of my gas on my credit cards	4031	A
because_1 that either you're not financed charged on there and you don't and you don't um you don't need to have cash there and they don't now you can get it at you know cash is the same price as credit	4031	A
so are you married	4031	A
which will suck up your money real quick	4031	A
um-hum	4031	A
drug testing in the work place um i've been tested a few times just before pre drug employment but that's about it i've never had random drug testing	4048	A
oh really what-	4048	A
uh-huh	4048	A
oh they do with alcohol	4048	A
they do it with alcohol	4048	A
oh i thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine	4048	A
huh that's interesting what type of field of work are you in	4048	A
oh in the oil business okay and you work in the office around	4048	A
uh-huh yeah see i work in the automotive air bag industry where we make the safety bags for the cars and we work around- around a lot of explosives	4048	A
yeah so that's you know i'm all for it because the well the type of environment i work in you know working- they're working with explosives and so they could blow up the whole	4048	A
well they have safety features with each of the explosives they use but still it can be dangerous	4048	A
yeah	4048	A
now do they fire them_1 or do they	4048	A
um-hum	4048	A
uh-huh	4048	A
oh wow	4048	A
huh that's i think our policy is that all right it's probably the same thing i'm not really sure because-	4048	A
but i know they do have counseling and that they do give you a second chance but i'm not sure if if it's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in	4048	A
uh-huh	4048	A
uh do you think it works very good with that random do you think it limits the	4048	A
uh-huh	4048	A
uh-huh	4048	A
you could time it just right	4048	A
i've met one employee i know when i was working with he had alcohol on his breath and i'm not sure if our policy covers that or not that'd be just as dangerous	4048	A
huh	4048	A
that's true	4048	A
um-hum do they give any limits on alcohol or is it	4048	A
oh	4048	A
uh-huh	4048	A
pretty good pretty good so we're talking about drug testing in the work place huh	4048	B
yeah we have random drug testing at in my business but i've never been uh never had to do it yeah yeah they started that about a year ago and i think it's mostly for the	4048	B
the field people that you know drive trucks and heavy machinery that kind of stuff	4048	B
but uh they they have done some testing around our office mostly after lunch looking for people drinking uh drinking beer and stuff at lunch time at least that's	4048	B
pardon	4048	B
yeah yeah they they they they'll check for alcohol	4048	B
now once once you start doing that stuff you sort of you're sort of stuck into uh checking for the whole the whole thing	4048	B
yeah it's a	4048	B
i'm in the oil business yeah	4048	B
yeah i work in the office so uh it's pretty pretty safe environment	4048	B
uh-huh uh-huh	4048	B
well that sounds like kind of an important job to be uh straight on	4048	B
yeah yeah well i- i- i agree i think that uh	4048	B
you know under certain circumstances especially when you're working in in high risk uh	4048	B
uh industries where you can really hurt other people that that you need to have that kind of stuff	4048	B
you know if it's as long as it's not abused uh	4048	B
you know random you know as long as it's random and and the individual's rights are uh are protected i don't have that big a problem with it	4048	B
well see is this is where i start having my problems with my company i work for a private company and and the the policy is something like	4048	B
see if i can restate this correctly now if you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem then you're eligible for company counseling	4048	B
but if they catch you if you test positive for a a controlled substance then you get fired	4048	B
so it you know it's sort of one of these little catch twenty twos	4048	B
yeah	4048	B
yeah our yeah our company's a little tougher on the second chance i mean if if they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in then they ought to	4048	B
you know go out of the way i think a little bit more to uh to help you get you help get you rehabilitated to you know to get get back at your job	4048	B
but uh when you're not when you're a private company the rules don't always apply	4048	B
well it's it's hard for me to to evaluate it because everybody i work around is in an office environment and you know it's not	4048	B
i guess i haven't- haven't run into anybody that's that's had a problem that's that's been a problem	4048	B
uh	4048	B
so i guess- you know i guess it works uh	4048	B
much like uh	4048	B
well shoot like any lottery i mean everybody's got an equal chance to get picked	4048	B
so uh i'd rather have that than you know say well this week the A's and B's are going to be in and next week C's and D's are going to come in	4048	B
yeah right right	4048	B
yeah especially around uh you know equipment machinery and stuff	4048	B
you know i've i've gone out and had a had a beer at lunch time but	4048	B
not to excess in any case	4048	B
uh i don't remember to tell you the truth i don't think they do	4048	B
um	4048	B
well i- they must i mean gee whiz	4048	B
that just shows you how much i've been paying attention because_1 i- i really don't know i'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask	4048	B
well you know you can take some of that that testing a little bit too far uh there was a company in Houston that they did uh an unannounced drug sweep of the of their company	4048	B
oh it was it was it was an unannounced sweep of of it was not only drugs	4048	B
how do you feel about capital punishment	4035	A
yeah	4035	A
for what reasons	4035	A
um-hum	4035	A
yeah definitely yeah i- i i agree that you know capital punishment is bad but just more for the economic- for economic reasons because i- i don't think it acts as a deterrent	4035	A
and i don't think that um and and and for what i've what i've read it costs a lot more to actually you know go through the process of condemning someone and killing them than it does to actually just feed them for the end- end you know	4035	A
uh-huh	4035	A
uh-huh	4035	A
uh-huh	4035	A
um-hum	4035	A
is he prosecution-	4035	A
oh he's he's a he's for the defendant okay	4035	A
uh-huh	4035	A
yeah	4035	A
uh-huh	4035	A
uh-huh	4035	A
yeah it's uh i mean i've you know i've seen people that you know definitely got screwed by the system	4035	A
before yeah um is do they have the death penalty in New York	4035	A
yeah they do um yeah i'm not sure how often we how often this actually it seems like about once a year they execute someone i don't really keep you know i don't really keep up after when the last one was	4035	A
um-hum	4035	A
um-hum	4035	A
um-hum	4035	A
constitutional	4035	A
uh-huh	4035	A
uh-huh	4035	A
um-hum	4035	A
in Tennessee	4035	A
you know one thing that i've always that i've one idea that i've heard that that that i've you know kind of had some sympathy for is though that you know when you have someone that's	4035	A
you know that that that that you know that that you are going to be stuck is going to be stuck with life imprisonment you know or two hundred and fifty years you know none of it served you know at the same time that you know to give them the choice of having the death penalty	4035	A
it just- seems you know if you lock him away for the rest of his life you know	4035	A
uh-huh	4035	A
uh-huh yeah he he told us his yeah he said that he wanted to die at that point	4035	A
um-hum it	4035	A
you know it really bothers me that in historical cases you know where you know someone tries to kill themselves in prison you know and when they're you know on death row and and you know where they've actually you know spent you know thousands of dollars reviving them you know just to kill them	4035	A
and that always that always seemed to be you know some sort of	4035	A
um-hum	4035	A
oh like in Texas	4035	A
um i'm i'm definitely against it definitely against it	4035	B
uh i think that they make a lot- the system makes a lot of mistakes and a lot of innocent people are probably convicted of crimes and it's bad enough when um	4035	B
you know when it's not capital punishment but when it's capital punishment when you find out later it's too late	4035	B
yeah it dose because because of uh the the legal system that we have now and i'm sure you can make it cheaper if you wanted i don't think you should	4035	B
but you can make it cheaper to kill people by not allowing all the appeals and as a matter of fact i think they are starting to cut back on some of them at the Supreme Court	4035	B
um i forgot what area it is but regarding uh capital punishment there are some cases that won't automatically get reviewed by the Supreme Court when they used to be	4035	B
so what happens is you have to pay all these high powered lawyers to keep on arguing the case over and over again uh while they're waiting for capital punishment which is what happened uh which happens a lot a friend of mine uh does that type of work down in uh	4035	B
down in Tennessee he's a he's an attorney he represents people on death row	4035	B
yeah yeah and i did criminal defense work for a while so i kind of have a a um let's say um	4035	B
cynical about the system and the way people are convicted of crimes not that i think i do believe that most people are charged with crimes and convicted- certainly people that are convicted of crimes most of them are probably guilty anyway	4035	B
i mean i'm not denying that but there are a few that probably aren't	4035	B
yeah so	4035	B
no huh um they do in Georgia right yeah they	4035	B
right well that's the thing i mean i happened to have been talking to somebody at at uh work today about that	4035	B
just happened to come up in conversation and so i was surprised when i got this topic come up and uh the	4035	B
the bottom line was that uh what was i saying uh nobody in Tennessee has been convicted- has been executed since nineteen	4035	B
uh seventy- uh what seventy three or whenever it was that they ruled that the death penalty was cruel and unconstitutional-	4035	B
yeah and whether it was unconstitutional and then like i said they came back and um like the nineteen eighties and and determined that if they have like a separate trial to determine the death penalty they call them bifricated trials	4035	B
um they have a separate trial just to determine whether they're going to give the death penalty or not	4035	B
um then then that's okay they can it it becomes constitutional i guess it's like a procedural protection that that people have	4035	B
um but nobody's been nobody's been executed since they've brought that back and	4035	B
yeah in Tennessee so it puts a lot of pressure on them_1 yeah	4035	B
yeah	4035	B
yeah but it's kind of like under under duress anyway but you know kind of saying to someone all right now that we've got you by the chops because you decide whether you're going to die or not but but yeah that's what that guy Gary Gilmore did right	4035	B
you know the guy	4035	B
right and they you know kind of chose his way to death which is is kind of interesting but um	4035	B
yeah i- i- i personally think people have the right to die if they want so yeah if you if you're in death- if you're in jail for life then you should be able to commit suicide if that's what you want	4035	B
which is basically what that is but	4035	B
yeah sure	4035	B
i did some i did some environmental- environmental law as well and and one of the i remember in studying something about the F D A they was it what the hell were they trying to do they were trying to get a a a drug	4035	B
it was a drug that was that they were using for the death penalty and they tried- to right they tried to get it proved safe before the F D A would approve it	4035	B
right i- i- i actually i live in the city and uh i guess it is a concern of mine uh	4023	B
you know for my own safety	4023	B
oh that's right um	4023	B
uh i think it is bad in certain areas however i think uh the area that i live in it's not	4023	B
uh the the crime level is not as high as it is in other areas of the of the city i think it seems that there's certain- certain areas where uh the crime is focused um	4023	B
well i think it's what's been happening over the last several years it seems they've been beefing up the police patrols trying to put put more guys more cops higher visibility	4023	B
and uh it had some impact but not a tremendous amount	4023	B
and probably um	4023	B
they need to try to increase community involvement that sort of thing i think's the best way there is	4023	B
yeah	4023	B
you know uh particularly in some of the housing projects	4023	B
uh you know that's that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused and they've got to do more than just having having cops there they've got to kind of change the way people think about it	4023	B
um well i've been to i'd say it's it's probably in the top	4023	B
top ten in terms of crime	4023	B
um	4023	B
it's nowhere near as bad as New York City for example probably not not as bad as Detroit	4023	B
no	4023	B
yeah that seems to be true um yeah if you've ever been to like New York City and	4023	B
you can just you can just as you walk through the street on a given evening you can see crimes being committed it's that obvious	4023	B
yeah that's true	4023	B
with a big stick or	4023	B
right	4023	B
sure right don't don't walk down a an alley or don't get just try to keep yourself out of a bad situation but yeah there are times when you can't avoid all that um and and then you're kind of	4023	B
on your own	4023	B
uh no the only thing i've ever had is i've had my wallet lifted	4023	B
but that was in a more of a	4023	B
a a setting where there was a number of people around and i kind of got i was much younger at the time and kind of a couple of people they just took it from me without me knowing really	4023	B
and kind of passed it off so i didn't know who had it	4023	B
i've had that happen but that's that's about it	4023	B
oh yeah	4023	B
hum	4023	B
really well i've had my	4023	B
um-hum i've had my car stolen so maybe that counts	4023	B
yeah	4023	B
oh no that was in the northern part- um up near Cumberland Mall area it's actually Cobb County but it is Atlanta	4023	B
and uh there's a lot of car thefts in that area	4023	B
right yeah	4023	B
yeah	4023	B
yeah mine was just it had been wrecked and some superficial type damage but they didn't they didn't strip it	4023	B
so i got it back	4023	B
yeah	4023	B
than most	4023	B
right it it was about three grand to put everything together they cracked the steering column of course to steal the car	4023	B
yeah you've got to you crack the steering column then you pull the there's a pin in there that you can pull on these GM cars and you can start- start it up basically pretty easily	4023	B
well after i found mine i had to i had this	4023	B
so Martin how do you feel about crime in the city uh you said you're from Atlanta	4023	A
um-hum	4023	A
um-hum	4023	A
i mean do you find- do you find crime in Atlanta really bad i mean i live in Atlanta also	4023	A
uh-huh	4023	A
um-hum	4023	A
um-hum	4023	A
well what do you think can be done about the crime in the city	4023	A
um-hum	4023	A
i'd probably agree with that	4023	A
uh	4023	A
um-hum	4023	A
yeah that's probably true um	4023	A
so do- um well do you think Atlanta is as bad as most other cities	4023	A
um-hum	4023	A
um-hum i don't think it's as bad as LA either	4023	A
we i don't think we don't we have as much of the gang problem as a lot of the other cities have	4023	A
um-hum	4023	A
um-hum	4023	A
yeah	4023	A
i know i've i've come to the conclusion also that you know just if you are walking in a downtown area you know where where there's a lot of crime a lot of that's gonna just just keeping your senses about you and you know- trying not to look like a victim	4023	A
you know	4023	A
you know walk with- you know walk with you know with	4023	A
well not silly just walk you know confidently and you know don't don't be looking around like you've never been there before and you have no idea where you are	4023	A
yeah	4023	A
um-hum	4023	A
um-hum	4023	A
yeah	4023	A
and if you have you ever have you ever been mugged in Atlanta	4023	A
um-hum	4023	A
um-hum	4023	A
um-hum	4023	A
um-hum	4023	A
yeah i've been pretty lucky about getting mugged i don't	4023	A
yeah i think i've only actually seen like one you know one actual robbery with a gun	4023	A
and that's been about the only you know real violent crime where you know potentially violent crime that i've seen in Atlanta and that and that was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed	4023	A
oh really	4023	A
wow where was where where was that was that downtown or	4023	A
really	4023	A
um-hum metropolitan yeah	4023	A
yeah i've i've actually i've known known some people that have had their cars stolen	4023	A
um	4023	A
and uh and uh you know but half the time they seem to	4023	A
the APD seems to recover them you know in in various states of disrepair up on blocks you know my friend who had a um	4023	A
VW Rabbit and when he when he got it back his um dashboard was sitting in in his front seat	4023	A
um-hum	4023	A
well you're probably luckier than	4023	A
um-hum	4023	A
um	4023	A
so does like insurance pay for the body damage or was that was that all it was body	4023	A
oh	4023	A
um-hum	4023	A
um-hum	4023	A
so how do you know this much about um stealing cars	4023	A
um yes some what um	4003	B
we do baby sitting here like	4003	B
my neighbor and i share baby sitting and um then i ran a preschool so i know you know from the other end you know trying to help people find	4003	B
find day care so yeah	4003	B
so what about you	4003	B
goodness	4003	B
um-hum	4003	B
how has that worked out	4003	B
oh	4003	B
yeah i can imagine i've got three kids and i think i mean	4003	B
it's sometimes it's easier like last week my husband was gone and i had my three nieces and nephews over and it was really much more calm than than than having just my three at home	4003	B
but yeah	4003	B
um hang hang on just a second <b_aside> um <e_aside>	4003	B
<b_aside> okay just a second i'm on the phone <e_aside> yeah i've got three preschoolers um but uh	4003	B
yeah i mean i i think it's we've wanted to do i've wanted to join a baby sitting co-op	4003	B
and um that's we there're several of them_1 around here um	4003	B
the one my my sister in law is in you have to be recommended in to	4003	B
the co-op you know that way some one knows you and you and you just aren't giving your kids out to any body and i just haven't found one that's close enough to me	4003	B
that i feel comfortable with at this point um	4003	B
but because_1 i mean you don't wanna you don't wanna leave with your kids with anybody and um	4003	B
the day care centers around here i i really my kids go to preschool and i have found some really good ones um	4003	B
one of them_1 goes two days a week and the other one goes one day a week and that's a nice break and it's this is a	4003	B
i really like the one that that they're in um they've got some really qualified teachers there they've been there for a long long time they've got um a	4003	B
certified kindergarten teacher doing the curriculum for the older you know the fours and the three year olds and stuff so that's that is really good i really like that	4003	B
yeah	4003	B
yeah i like that i i like that little break oh	4003	B
you- you you start out with like coupons and um i don't i think i think you start out like with say twenty or thirty and and you have to um	4003	B
when when you baby sit somebody they pay you in coupons and then um	4003	B
they uh then you pay the other people in coupons and i think some of them is in like thirty minute time slots or in hour time slots and you have to do it	4003	B
you know per child um at least the the ones that i've seen that have worked and then they normally get together like once a month and um	4003	B
to you know decide you know how many do you have and and then	4003	B
they say okay you need to you know if if you're taking in a lot of baby sitting	4003	B
and you're not you know doling it out also then um	4003	B
a lot of times they'll say okay you need to you know you need to let people sit for you um that way it'll even out you some people aren't getting you know without they don't have any more coupons left	4003	B
and um their monthly meetings the one i went to one and they a lot of times they'll have um special people come and talk about	4003	B
uh say safety or you know different things with about children and some times they'll just have get togethers you know even even with the kids like during the day and stuff	4003	B
so it gets them helps them to know one another and then you know its can be pretty informative also	4003	B
yeah	4003	B
yeah i that's i don't know all the um i don't know all the details uh um i i i don't know if	4003	B
it seems like it seems like her the my sister in law's um uh they are in	4003	B
okay um have you had any experience in trying to find child care	4003	A
uh-huh	4003	A
um-hum	4003	A
um-hum	4003	A
really	4003	A
okay well i've done more or less the same we have five children and um	4003	A
uh yeah i just haven't found it equitable to work outside the home and so i have done the day care inside my home	4003	A
well i've done it for seven years and uh it's pretty well driven me crazy	4003	A
oh	4003	A
oh was it oh	4003	A
uh-huh that's true sometimes- sometimes they do offer a just a play time for your kids	4003	A
uh-huh	4003	A
hum	4003	A
okay	4003	A
oh my goodness	4003	A
oh	4003	A
uh-huh	4003	A
uh-huh	4003	A
uh-huh	4003	A
oh	4003	A
um-hum	4003	A
no no you don't	4003	A
oh good	4003	A
oh how fun	4003	A
um-hum	4003	A
oh good	4003	A
um-hum	4003	A
um-hum	4003	A
that would be fun yeah that's good for the kids and then it's fun for you too to have that little break during the week	4003	A
oh now on that co-op um do women just trade baby sitting or	4003	A
oh	4003	A
oh	4003	A
um-hum oh gosh	4003	A
uh-huh uh-huh	4003	A
uh-huh	4003	A
uh-huh	4003	A
oh what my goodness	4003	A
uh-huh	4003	A
um-hum	4003	A
oh	4003	A
well that sounds like a terrific idea my goodness i haven't heard of anything like that out here in Utah and it sounds like that'd be something good to start huh	4003	A
i'm an avid recycler um but our city's not doing as much as they ought to what about you all there	4069	A
uh-huh	4069	A
uh-huh	4069	A
you don't know yeah	4069	A
right that they pick up	4069	A
um-hum	4069	A
um-hum	4069	A
uh-huh	4069	A
right	4069	A
nobody wanted to do it	4069	A
it do you have a place to take them_1	4069	A
wow is that right	4069	A
worth it yeah not worth the gas huh yeah	4069	A
right	4069	A
yeah oh i know i know it	4069	A
now what do they do i have cats too but they don't do anything with newspaper	4069	A
oh really	4069	A
do- with their claws or chew it	4069	A
how fascinating	4069	A
oh isn't that interesting i've got three cats but newspapers don't seem to interest them at all	4069	A
oh no	4069	A
is that right oh my gosh	4069	A
and then they learned how huh	4069	A
well that's funny well i- i we we do have more facilities than that around here so that we they're they are trying in Dallas to do some	4069	A
uh curbside recycling they've got special- special you they selected sites and in those sites they they've been doing it and they've had a pretty good success so they're talking about_1	4069	A
you know doing it more but it isn't in my area so i've got a kitchen full of you know cans and bottles and scrap metal and	4069	A
everything and and then i have to drive it somewhere and there	4069	A
uh then everybody would do it well it's one of those things that makes you feel good you know makes you feel like you're part of of a of a solution to a problem	4069	A
and and uh there's not that much that makes you feel like you've got any control over anything so	4069	A
back to the grocery so your grocery store does that uh-huh yeah well that's good	4069	A
and that's strange because now bottles are the one thing that are totally recyclable they're the easiest and and uh you know i mean i try to keep and reuse and i	4069	A
oh i even carry around uh you know like if i- i- i travel around the city a lot so that i'm frequently stopping at fast food place and eating in the car or on the way to the next site	4069	A
and i've gotten to saving the plastic forks and washing them and using them_1 again so i don't keep doing that but boy i mean it's an exhausting way to live	4069	A
we are very use to throwing things out there's no question about it and	4069	A
uh-huh	4069	A
yeah- right exactly- exactly lots of little uh soya sauces and ketchups all over the place	4069	A
yeah	4069	A
that's right that's right well now i've gotten to where i say don't put any of that in because_1 it just leaves me with having to dispose of it	4069	A
yeah	4069	A
and that's hard to get rid of unless you've got there's one place here in town that will take the slicks and all your junk mail and	4069	A
cereal boxes and everything but you have to drive it downtown and so you know my kitchen i mean certainly i don't like anyone to ever come in because i've just got this stuff everywhere i don't drive it every day so i've got just piles of it	4069	A
right	4069	A
but but you have to move out of your house to have all that yeah	4069	A
you know because they'll think there's nothing in this car but trash anyway	4069	A
there is a group in town called Nacogdoches Recycles that will meet i believe it's once a month at the park and you can take plastics papers	4069	B
or bottles	4069	B
but it's up to you to collect them_1 it's up to you to get them_1 down there and then what they do with them i don't know	4069	B
there isn't any you- somebody had had talked once before to City Council meeting about maybe having different colored waste cans	4069	B
uh-huh because_1 they do that in Palestine and nobody wanted to go for that they were gonna charge a little extra on the bill and nobody wanted to do that	4069	B
and i save aluminum cans and	4069	B
to take those to the to the closest place is about	4069	B
it's about thirty minutes away	4069	B
yeah and it and the last time we took some things	4069	B
the price is not really	4069	B
worth it	4069	B
yeah yeah because_1 by the time and you save them_1 and squish them_1 and	4069	B
they're just they were everywhere	4069	B
and that's the bad thing about it and newspapers we we started saving newspapers and stuff well they just packed up and i have cats well they had a field day	4069	B
destroyed those	4069	B
mine have some kind of paper thing oh yes any any kind of cardboard and paper and they just tear it up	4069	B
um-hum both	4069	B
i don't know what it is	4069	B
i don't know what it is and you can't leave the mail don't i don't leave the mail on on the coffee table or it's chewed up	4069	B
and it was just really one i've got i've got several and one in particular but then she kind of showed the other ones what was going on	4069	B
uh-huh so now it's just a big play play time	4069	B
yeah i think if they would make it a little more convenient for us everybody would	4069	B
that's true	4069	B
oh i know and we take the little plastic bags back to the to the grocery store	4069	B
uh-huh	4069	B
but but as far as bottles and things go there isn't any place any any close	4069	B
yeah yeah	4069	B
um-hum	4069	B
it really is	4069	B
yeah i i've started saving like you said the plastic knives and forks and things	4069	B
and i save all the little condiments and things and i	4069	B
yeah things that i normally threw out because they just give you ton and now i've got a big basket full in the refrigerator	4069	B
exactly they'll say do you want any no i do not	4069	B
but i- i- try and we have a lot of of newspapers and magazines and things like that but	4069	B
that's	4069	B
yeah and i've got a tiny little kitchen so the option of you know some people will maybe have four bins one for your garbage and then i have no room	4069	B
yeah i have i have room enough for one garbage can and that it is	4069	B
yeah	4069	B
and that's true	4069	B
all right go	4091	B
good	4091	B
is what do they what do they give you stock in the company you work for	4091	B
right	4091	B
wow	4091	B
yeah yeah that sounds good	4091	B
what company is that	4091	B
excuse me	4091	B
Interleaf never heard of it	4091	B
oh okay	4091	B
yeah what are we supposed to talk about- salaries- benefits besides salary is that	4091	B
yeah but i- i get a i get a pretty good i work for the City of New York	4091	B
and i get a pretty good um health plan	4091	B
and	4091	B
yeah the health plan's pretty good and and we get um they also have a deferred compensation plan which is similar to what you're talking about where they'll they'll take out money tax free from your income and invest it	4091	B
and it's a group investment so you i think you also save fees	4091	B
it's like a 401K plan except they don't they don't contribute	4091	B
right	4091	B
yeah i think i think you can take out the money anytime you want but you'll pay you'll pay taxes on it and you're better off waiting until you retire when you are probably going to have less income or some something like that	4091	B
yeah uh	4091	B
wow that's that's really good	4091	B
right	4091	B
if you own oh okay i see	4091	B
right	4091	B
hello	4091	B
yeah it uh it was a width away that's why it's it's every time i talk it sounds weird but uh yeah there's there's other benefits too noneconomic i mean there's there's uh	4091	B
there's benefits just in working for a big organization i think in in that you have a lot of uh different people doing a lot of different things and	4091	B
okay	4091	B
right well that's working for the city is somewhat like that except for my unit you know i have control over what goes on in my unit and and just that	4091	B
um but what i mean is i- i say for instance i'm an attorney uh a collection attorney for the City of New York and and in the environmental control board and	4091	B
i'm i've learned so much about computer systems and sharing of information all these managerial type things that i never thought i'd be involved with and if i was in private practice i'd never be able to learn all that stuff	4091	B
i guess that starts it um	4091	A
so um i guess right now what's most important for me uh doing is coming up is we have a really good stock program	4091	A
uh where i work and it's gonna give me about a three hundred percent return	4091	A
this time around on my uh investment	4091	A
which is definitely helping since i'm gonna buy a house	4091	A
yeah what they do is- what they do is it's it's a purchase program	4091	A
where you get the stock it's- it's- it's on a one year cycle and you get it at eighty five percent of the lower of the beginning and the end price for the year	4091	A
so like the the set price at the beginning of the year last May was five sixty four a share	4091	A
stocks trading about fourteen now	4091	A
so and you so i'll get to buy it at five sixty four- four and turn around the same day	4091	A
the only down side is they do it as a withholding off your uh income so you got to kind of you know be willing to squirrel away at whatever you wanna do	4091	A
yeah	4091	A
that's with Interleaf	4091	A
Interleaf	4091	A
uh desktop publishing	4091	A
so	4091	A
but um you know	4091	A
yeah benefits other than salary	4091	A
um-hum	4091	A
yeah but that that's definitely a good thing to have especially these days	4091	A
right	4091	A
what is what is that like a uh like a uh TIACREF type thing	4091	A
okay yeah so it's for retirement	4091	A
yeah so you you have to wait until like fifty five or	4091	A
right	4091	A
yeah we we we've got a 401K here	4091	A
but um i chose to go into the stock program because you can't lose on it and you know i can always take the money off of that if i wasn't saving up for the house i would be putting money into a 401K	4091	A
but you know i'd much rather get the eighteen- eighteen percent minimum return on the stock and use that for the house	4091	A
but yeah you know medical- medical is good you know we get a good program here what's basically a hundred percent coverage for about twenty bucks a month	4091	A
it's like your yeah it is it's a very good company as far as benefits go they've got 401K's they've got uh	4091	A
the health coverage they've got you know the stock program they've got uh 125K selling it for twenty bucks they do put it in the dental- you know dental is like you know eighty or fifty percent depending on what you're doing	4091	A
um and you know you the 125K means i can pay that piece out of pre tax money rather than post tax	4091	A
the only problem with 125K is you got to say at the beginning of the year i think i'm gonna have a thousand dollars of expenses this year and then you have to be willing to have that money deducted from your salary and if you don't use the thousand dollars it goes away	4091	A
so at the end of the year if you haven't used it all up it's you know the feds take it or or whoever takes it it just disappears	4091	A
but you know if if you know you know so you wanna underestimate a little bit so like you know i know i easily have a thousand dollars or five hundred dollars a year of dental and and miscellaneous- miscellaneous medical and deductibles	4091	A
so i just have them_1 pull you know five hundred it means i pay like you know as opposed to paying like you know eight hundred dollars i pay or five hundred i pay like three hundred because_1 it's on pre tax	4091	A
yeah i'm here	4091	A
yeah	4091	A
yeah	4091	A
yeah i i think it it depends how flat the organization is if you know hang on my computer is talking to me um you know it depends how flat it is if it's um	4091	A
i don't like working in an organization where you're really deep in the tree	4091	A
because_1 then you start to feel like you've got no real you know power to change anything	4091	A
right	4091	A
um-hum	4091	A
um-hum	4091	A
um-hum	4091	A
yeah but there's two sides to that because also you know i've seen a lot of i knew somebody who worked for Digital and for two years he worked on like you know the tape driver for one tape drive and that's all he did	4091	A
uh well it's nice to talk with you um	4017	A
oh i guess i'll go ahead and start off with uh i think that there's two things that could be done that are procedural to uh	4017	A
to help the budget the first i believe in would be to give the president a line item veto um	4017	A
uh i think that a lot of times the the members of congress	4017	A
uh when they're faced with uh the possibility of having to to cut jobs in their district by because of shutting down a federal project or something just don't have the	4017	A
the willpower on their own to uh	4017	A
to make the tough decisions and sometimes it would be best to give that over to the president who who has overall responsibility for the whole country and can uh	4017	A
i guess be a little bit more insulated from from uh the concerns of one of one district	4017	A
yeah that's exactly right	4017	A
yeah one of the the uh there's a bill pending before congress which i'm trying to remember what it's called it's something like the pork buster bill that um if approved would make it uh	4017	A
uh uh you wouldn't be able to um	4017	A
put in uh new projects and things in a conference committee or at anytime where they weren't reviewed by the regular committee that has responsibility for that	4017	A
and that's like what you were talking about where they slip things in at the last minute	4017	A
and the conference committee is really the worst place for that to happen	4017	A
uh because no one	4017	A
uh	4017	A
uh has uh it doesn't go back into the regular committee for review after the conference committee it just goes back to the house and the senate for a final up or down vote on the whole thing	4017	A
i agree	4017	A
um-hum	4017	A
yeah it it really sometimes seems that there is there's nobody out there uh watching out for uh for we the people and making sure that the money is spent wisely uh	4017	A
and i don't know that just sort of seems to be unfortunately part of the just how the system uh operates now uh we-	4017	A
gee is there anything specific that you think uh uh in the way of federal programs or whatever that would be eliminated to try to cut federal spending	4017	A
and just eliminate all that high level bureaucracy	4017	A
how do you feel about bringing home all of our troops from Europe and the Far East and letting Germany and Japan defend themselves	4017	A
yeah	4017	A
well we'll always have a presence there but we don't we don't need to have half a million troops overseas	4017	A
that's right	4017	A
um-hum	4017	A
yeah another area that's that i really think ought to be cut is is direct uh foreign aid	4017	A
i agree with that	4017	B
local politics yeah	4017	B
well also too often too the uh individual congressman has the uh especially if they are on on uh some of the committees that put these budgets together	4017	B
uh have the opportunity to slide things in that normally should not have gone in at all and the line- yeah and the line item uh veto would be ideal for that i mean to	4017	B
yeah	4017	B
yeah	4017	B
yeah	4017	B
there's another idea- uh uh another uh way where the budget could uh probably benefit and this has to do of course uh it has to do with federal projects	4017	B
too often uh those are uh not there's no uh accountability once the uh projects are awarded to make sure that the quality is done and they end up getting stuck with	4017	B
billions of dollars of overlay	4017	B
or if contracts are put out uh no one uh is responsible or it does does not seem to be	4017	B
for following up that if it goes over budget it it well you know it's set up laissez faire attitude well that's to be expected we just sort of built it in well that shouldn't happen that way	4017	B
and i think i think if there was more attention paid to uh what's being uh spent and more accountability that would help enormous- enormously too are	4017	B
how who or how that would come about i'm not uh sure but that's an an an area that i think needs to be uh looked at	4017	B
well i think uh there could be a lot of consolidation of programs	4017	B
uh looking at of course there they have been a lot of talk to begin with but looking at and the the military's a big uh	4017	B
area that uh has taken a lot of shots recently but i- i do not see the point of having four different services	4017	B
uh i do not see why they could not have one military service	4017	B
that's right because a lot of the monies are spent uh with insiding within those departments	4017	B
uh	4017	B
basically i'm in i'm in agreement with that	4017	B
uh i would think that there probably needs to be a uh monitor or not a monitor uh	4017	B
or courtesy you know yeah a presence but not a	4017	B
no well witness- witness the the recent Gulf War too even with uh troops all over Europe uh it took several months to gear up	4017	B
and so what was the point of having them to begin with	4017	B
so um do you have a PC	4008	A
um-hum yeah one of my friends are into Macintoshes i have a um PC my a IBM PC myself	4008	A
a two eighty six but i'm probably eventually going to get a three eighty six	4008	A
um	4008	A
um mostly um word processing applications and uh just as a dumb terminal uh	4008	A
but i'm um i think eventually i'll start using it for spread sheets and things like that um what do you find that you use yours mostly for	4008	A
um-hum	4008	A
um-hum	4008	A
no i i think i i'm planning on like moving up getting a three eighty six before i move up to Windows although you know i do like the the graphical user environment yeah	4008	A
yeah it's just-	4008	A
um i want it i want it you know well i just- i just want it more for multitasking which i suppose is also like a Macintosh um	4008	A
um-hum	4008	A
yeah i used- that's what i learned a lot of languages on was an Apple two E in my high school	4008	A
um-hum	4008	A
um-hum	4008	A
well do you use your computer for uh	4008	A
just things around the house or in the in the	4008	A
i see what do you do	4008	A
oh wow um and uh are these like uh do these programs um	4008	A
are they are they based on on a on a um	4008	A
other language or are they based are are they based like a lot of the um i know a lot of the the English as a second language classes will have people from all sorts of you know parts of the world	4008	A
and the teacher just tries to tries to teach English you know through natural understanding	4008	A
um-hum	4008	A
well it was just uh when i was in high school i worked for the community school and they had a English second language class and it always seemed strange to me that you know all these all these people that you know	4008	A
spoke English not too well and spoke you know a variety of different languages were all being taught at the same time	4008	A
imagine it's a lot harder on a computer because you have to you know you don't have as many cues you can't don't have hand gestures and things like that	4008	A
um-hum	4008	A
um-hum	4008	A
oh to see how well they retain the vocabulary and things like that	4008	A
um-hum	4008	A
um-hum	4008	A
um-hum	4008	A
yeah i'd imagine so um	4008	A
so um what were you doing when you were using an Apple two E	4008	A
um-hum it it's amazing-	4008	A
yes it it's amazing you know how how like in the general user community the expectations have just grown so much i remember my first computer was a TRS eighty with four K on it	4008	A
and you know and then then i moved- and then i started playing with Apples you know and and those had forty eight or you know if if they were really great they had sixty four K you know	4008	A
uh all i know i know that in my school they had a bunch that had sixteen K on them	4008	A
is all and there's i remember that there was one game that i played that required forty eight K and there was only one computer that had forty eight K on it at the time	4008	A
and you know it's just so amazing that generally you know if you if you i'm not sure about- about um Macintoshes but i know in IBM's you you you generally you know you buy a megabyte at a time	4008	A
you know that's that's your low that's the low end	4008	A
um	4008	A
um-hum	4008	A
um-hum yeah imagine just to support	4008	A
yes i have a Macintosh SE thirty	4008	B
um-hum	4008	B
what do you use yours for mostly	4008	B
uh-huh	4008	B
well i do a lot of word processing and spread sheets and data base and uh about the only thing i am uh i'm just starting to get in into uh a little bit more communications now i've just uh today ordered a fax modem so i'll be able to	4008	B
send and receive faxes right over there without using you know you don't have to make a hard copy that way	4008	B
uh are you using windows	4008	B
uh-huh	4008	B
uh-huh well it's getting to be more and more like a Macintosh	4008	B
um-hum well the one thing i used to use a i've never used an IBM actually i used to use a just an Apple two E which of course is looks pretty primitive now	4008	B
but i don't have any uh any real programming capabilities on my uh Mac right now i don't have uh any compilers	4008	B
so i'm uh wanting-	4008	B
i use it in my business	4008	B
i uh do uh consultation and and testing of various kinds for uh English as a second language programs	4008	B
that's uh exactly what yeah that's the kind of thing i'm working with exactly you seem to be uh better informed than the average person on that	4008	B
um-hum	4008	B
right well now we uh what i use a computer for is to write materials that are later printed though most of the stuff that i do is not uh interactive	4008	B
and then i use it for testing- uh data analysis on testing so	4008	B
well just actually just uh item analysis statistical analysis of the tests uh	4008	B
you know when you when you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing	4008	B
and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones aren't find out how reliable the test is you try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort so it's involves a lot of spread sheet use	4008	B
well i was doing some of the same stuff but doing it more slowly and with smaller files i can't believe you know i've got uh	4008	B
five uh megabytes on this one now and on my two E i had a hundred twenty eight K	4008	B
yeah	4008	B
oh the old	4008	B
the old Apple uh the the the original Apple had what yeah forty eight i guess didn't it	4008	B
my goodness	4008	B
uh-huh	4008	B
um-hum	4008	B
well the SE thirty goes up to eight	4008	B
but i haven't upgraded it quite that far yet i think probably when i get system seven i may have to do that and and get another possibly another hard disk i don't know they say that system seven uses a lot of memory	4008	B
okay well um about_1 capital punishment first of all i know that in uh Texas they have lethal death by lethal injection i guess that's the uh preferred method have they used anything else	4011	A
in in Texas in your memory	4011	A
i see	4011	A
oh yeah that's that's kind of the euphemistic term for it um so uh have you been following the the Dahlmer case at all	4011	A
that one's a little too grizzly too huh	4011	A
um-hum	4011	A
hum	4011	A
i see um do you think that uh putting putting those people in jail permanently would be an equally good solution	4011	A
um-hum	4011	A
um-hum	4011	A
um-hum	4011	A
well certainly for for someone like Charles Manson who's very definitely going to stay in jail for the rest of his life i uh i- i can't imagine that he will ever be allowed out by the parole board that uh his life is not going to improve	4011	A
um do you think uh do you think that that uh the death penalty is effective as a means of retribution	4011	A
yeah as as as a deterrent value yeah	4011	A
um-hum	4011	A
um well to be honest i think that the uh capital punishment is is is a uh red herring in the crime and punishment business	4011	A
um as you said we're letting our people out far too much really the problem is	4011	A
that i- i think two fold number one in Los Angeles as you may know there's uh lots and lots of problem high crime areas and and uh	4011	A
in black parts of town the cops the cops don't trust the the people who live there and the people don't live there trust- uh people don't trust the cops who who uh	4011	A
run the beat so in this heated air of mistrust people don't do what's necessary	4011	A
to keep crime down because	4011	A
uh you know if if uh it takes too much work or if you're liable to get beaten just because you're black or whatever things are not going to change and so	4011	A
capital punishment doesn't matter if the criminals who are committing the crimes don't get caught in the first place	4011	A
oh yeah as as uh	4011	A
yeah	4011	A
yeah exactly you know John John Singleton who's who uh made the film um Boys in the Hood noted that uh one in twenty five black men will be killed at the hands of other black men	4011	A
and uh that's you know for them the death penalty is irrelevant i mean it's what what difference is that going to make to them there's got to be more effective policing and there's got to be more trust on both sides of the equation	4011	A
yeah	4011	B
i don't know to tell you the truth i don't follow it uh any more than i have to but i do know someone was just recently uh	4011	B
put to sleep	4011	B
exactly	4011	B
ooh no more than- again no more than i have to um i have very mixed feelings about this whole issue um	4011	B
uh i- i really don't like the idea of of uh death penalty capital- capital punishment however you want to put it	4011	B
um and yet i do	4011	B
concur that there are some people that have to be kept away	4011	B
forever yeah i mean i really do think there are some people that there's nothing that can be done about so it makes a dilemma for me	4011	B
i- i the i always think about it in terms of myself and i really wonder if i'd really wanna be in jail for the rest of my life or just killed	4011	B
i mean i think i and some have asked to be killed	4011	B
you know there there have been been some criminals who said	4011	B
and this is what i want and i can yeah i can see that side of it	4011	B
uh because_1 i don't know what life is like what what life means if you're in jail the rest of your life	4011	B
um-hum	4011	B
a a deterrent or right- yeah	4011	B
i'm not i don't know uh uh you know i don't think we've we haven't used it enough they say in in in countries where you know you're gonna have your hand cut off you know if you steal et cetera that	4011	B
that it has that that there is less crime uh we certainly let our people out	4011	B
way too fast i don't know i don't think i've got enough evidence on that what about you	4011	B
um-hum	4011	B
um-hum	4011	B
um-hum	4011	B
i mean a white collar person thinking they may get killed you know that's a big deal	4011	B
but the other people are thinking they may get killed when they get up and walk to school	4011	B
yeah	4011	B
yes yeah	4011	B
yeah yeah	4011	B
that's right that that's right and uh what we do is we keep coming up with ways to handle- i mean i just heard the attorney general or i think it was on PBS the other night briefly going by because it made me to angry but he was talking about	4011	B
how wonderful our presidents have been because uh we've gotten this and that many more jails and	4011	B
well uh i myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in in specific uh	4049	B
very specific in this uh very specific examples such as uh transportation workers as in uh air traffic controllers bus drivers and that kind of thing	4049	B
um i don't really think that it's uh	4049	B
too many i think it's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say well we're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you're uh you know worthy of working for us i really don't see that that's a very very valid uh	4049	B
thing for a company to say and i personally i don't think i would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what's inside my body	4049	B
well i think i think what- you- i think the problem here is is that a a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs	4049	B
there's too many cases where it can you know there can be false positive results and that that sort of thing i don't think there's any definitive you know okay this person is taking drugs so we don't want him here	4049	B
uh	4049	B
like i said some industries though i think it'd be very necessary i wouldn't want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when i'm flying in an airplane	4049	B
but uh i mean i just i find it to be pretty offensive that that it's such a a big deal i mean if your employer's not going to trust you or you know it i just i think it's a whole trust issue i just can't see it	4049	B
uh yeah i have been	4049	B
i	4049	B
uh i mean i was very offended by by the whole process i mean it's it's very humiliating and i mean i'm not speaking in favor of drugs or against drugs but i uh i am totally against that sort of a uh	4049	B
i mean it's it's a pretty personal thing when somebody says i want to look at your urine before i'm going to talk to you	4049	B
right	4049	B
yeah	4049	B
right	4049	B
right that that's basically my opinion on it right there is that it's just	4049	B
you know i did i it was in the same sort of situation as it was a job interview and then you had a physical where you were drug tested and it's i just i mean i know people who have been drug tested and who have not you know	4049	B
been hired by a corporation	4049	B
which uh you know i really The other side of it is is besides its being an invasion of of personal privacy as in my it's my bodily fluid and i don't really want you to look at it or or something pretty basic like that just to the fact that	4049	B
i don't know that it is a company's business to regulate what it's employees are doing when they're not at work	4049	B
i mean the during the eight hours during the day when they're supposed to be there i think they have every right to say this is these behaviors are acceptable and these are not but when it enters into what they're doing when they're not at work i find that to be fairly offensive also	4049	B
right	4049	B
right	4049	B
that's exactly right	4049	B
and also i just think it it gets a lot i'm a big uh supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies and i think that it just moves down along a line that	4049	B
that i really would find bad if if most people went down that line into regulating employees' lives outside of work when you know there's already talk of people well we're not going to hire you if you smoke	4049	B
well you know i i can see how they can say in the work place we you don't want them to smoke but when somebody leaves work i don't think that it's the employer's right to regulate their lifestyle at all	4049	B
uh i really think it should be except as i've mentioned twice now in the specified industries or or jobs because there are certain things where it's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times	4049	B
and other than that i think i do not think it should be allowable i think it should be illegal for them to to want to do that	4049	B
it should it's kind of the big brother syndrome i mean i just anything like that just kind of scares me	4049	B
right	4049	B
right	4049	B
uh-huh	4049	A
yeah uh i guess i basically agree that uh do you think it's okay for a company	4049	A
to reject somebody just knowing that they have take drugs i mean suppose they found out some other way	4049	A
yeah so-	4049	A
yeah	4049	A
yeah	4049	A
have you ever been in a situation where you you were drug tested or	4049	A
yeah i have once too so	4049	A
yeah	4049	A
yeah i had it during a job interview and	4049	A
i just thought it was dumb of the company at a point where they were trying to convince me to to want to work for them	4049	A
to do this and i'm just like well uh i'm not even going to think much about it	4049	A
if you're gonna treat me with this much respect even before	4049	A
you've gotten to know me	4049	A
uh-huh	4049	A
yeah well like you say i mean if it's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt then really what people ought to be doing	4049	A
i mean the the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work rather than on these other factors	4049	A
and i mean if you are doing drugs and it's causing a problem then they'll notice it for other reasons	4049	A
yeah	4049	A
well do you think it's should be illegal for an employer to do this or	4049	A
yeah	4049	A
hum	4049	A
i tend to to view it	4049	A
even though i don't think i'd work for a company that did that i sort of want to defend	4049	A
an employer's rights as opposed to an individual's- uh in addition to an individual's rights but an employer really i think has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to	4049	A
and if they say they don't want smokers i sort of feel like an employer should have the right to decide whether they want to allow that	4049	A
uh and i don't really	4049	A
i'll talk about my city a little bit	4081	B
i've noticed that there's actually being uh quite there's been a quite a bit done uh i noticed that uh the uh several of my uh	4081	B
uh grocery stores have been putting up signs that plastic bags and uh trying to recycle the uh gallon uh containers	4081	B
so i i'm beginning to see some uh real positive effects i mean huh although i won't claim that- that the that that we're doing everything and it's uh you know i i try to recycle uh papers and cans	4081	B
uh i have not seen a whole lot of glass but the same time in this area	4081	B
at least when it comes to like uh Coke and Pepsi uh they don't really hardly use any glass	4081	B
uh-huh	4081	B
right	4081	B
right right well i i know that uh uh that's that one thing that uh they're not real good about yet is	4081	B
it seems like the paper sorting you still- we still are forced pretty much to take everything in you know we don't really have any help from the sanitation department	4081	B
so the life is not easy in that way we still have to kind of take care of our own aluminum uh so it's still up to the individual it's- it's not really part of any uh a government sponsored programs or anything	4081	B
uh yeah uh pretty much i i really don't live in the same county as what you'd call Atlanta central but there's several counties that count as Atlanta	4081	B
you well that's Dekalb actually it's you're right it's spelled that way D D E C A L B but that that's Dekalb	4081	B
right Fulton and actually also contained in that is Cobb and also contained in that uh to to some extent is Clayton county although it's pretty much uh still in the Atlanta proper	4081	B
uh but there's no concentrated concept	4081	B
uh on that sense uh we have uh	4081	B
yeah the the the central uh part of the city the downtown area is in Fulton almost exclusively	4081	B
uh but yeah i mean- i- i uh most cities tend to stay mostly- mostly in- in in one county so you know	4081	B
right	4081	B
anyways i guess i'm trying to figure out what else there is out here i mean oh we do get papers uh we get- we get some help with the papers uh our- our our uh	4081	B
uh trash company does do a a uh uh if if you sort the papers and and put them_1 in a bag they will put them_1 in a separate area into into the uh uh	4081	B
uh garbage- garbage truck i guess i don't know exactly how they do it but they do that	4081	B
well it pretty- well the the i guess it is in in in that sense uh it still is uh i don't i uh	4081	B
the uh the papers themselves i mean they some how put them_1 off to the side and i don't know exactly how they do it	4081	B
uh but they but they they do indicate that service	4081	B
i think that we you know i think they ought to really start pushing it more you know the idea that you were talking about where they they separate each each container	4081	B
that that should be more available we should have more containers in all city uh uh and all the grocery stores	4081	B
uh to help on on that sort of thing that would that would make it a lot easier	4081	B
i know in uh some cities that they actually distribute out they as part of the the service they give you extra containers that you can that you can put things into so you you know you don't have to go out and buy your own garbage cans and things like that	4081	B
well i'm actually originally from Dayton Ohio	4081	B
but that's	4081	B
okay_1	4081	A
um-hum	4081	A
um-hum	4081	A
um-hum	4081	A
um-hum what about glass they have glass	4081	A
huh so they know um here they have um they have trash sorting	4081	A
um i mean not- not right here where i am but in the in the town next door they have um	4081	A
they have trash sorting and you know they put out aluminum and glass and newspaper in separate bins	4081	A
and uh i guess there's a lot of raiding by homeless people and that kind of thing because they go out and it's like	4081	A
they they pay for this by the by the by the aluminum they collect	4081	A
um-hum	4081	A
um-hum	4081	A
i see so so um do you actually live in Atlanta	4081	A
um-hum	4081	A
yeah i know the cities are um i think Dekalb	4081	A
Dekalb yeah Dekalb and Fulton	4081	A
i thought it was i thought it was a K i always thought it was a K but um never mind um	4081	A
and uh isn't Fulton what another county that's uh	4081	A
um-hum um-hum	4081	A
huh	4081	A
now where's the city the city limits it's kind of odd that a city would actually spread over um more than one county the city limits would actually fall into more than one county	4081	A
um-hum	4081	A
um-hum	4081	A
yeah	4081	A
in fact and San Francisco is entirely within the the the limits of San Francisco County in fact San Francisco County and city have the same city limits	4081	A
so that's kind of a weird thing but um	4081	A
um-hum	4081	A
yeah that's an interesting term because i mean if you if you think about it's the garbage truck well is it really garbage if they're taking it off to be recycled and somebody's willing to pay for it	4081	A
huh	4081	A
huh	4081	A
um-hum	4081	A
right	4081	A
huh	4081	A
huh	4081	A
you have a you have a very uh distinctive accent um where're you from originally	4081	A
no kidding	4081	A
yeah- i actually get most of my news coverage off uh computer networks	4082	B
however i do also watch television news uh usually in the morning once a day and i read the front page of the Wall Street Journal most everyday	4082	B
uh well well- Dow Jones for example have a has a uh a news wire and it's uh it's picked up and actually available um at my office	4082	B
so it's no fee subscription i'm uh very easy to to read at my leisure and um it's sorted by category for example so i can read certain businesses or topics	4082	B
well it's similar to that but it's Dow Jones which is um The Wall Street Journal's news wire	4082	B
um well actually not uh i do uh follow um	4082	B
uh	4082	B
uh i don't know how to how to describe it um	4082	B
so it's a religious newspaper which which talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense it's a weekly but uh but not um	4082	B
but not like Business Week or uh or News Week or or or one of those kinds of things i i'd like to say that however um that i'm overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires	4082	B
um i- i think that it i think it has to do with uh	4082	B
i personally think i i have a problem with their viewpoint and i personally think that uh that there's a strong bias-	4082	B
there's a strong there's a strong bias in the media	4082	B
yeah absolutely after- after all who- who who writes are people are journalist who are trained to write and they're that's a liberal	4082	B
uh a liberal field at least from academia and uh the other thing that i always notice is that whenever they write about something that i'm	4082	B
an expert in i find their descriptions to be	4082	B
wrong	4082	B
and	4082	B
it	4082	B
that's right well even if it's not technical if it's um social thing or or whatever it doesn't matter if i'm expert in it they usually make mistakes which leads me to believe that the things i'm not expert in that they're telling me lies	4082	B
i- i think both uh by deliberate um i mean mistakes- mistakes of omission or uh or uh bias toward the particular viewpoint particular liberal view point that they have	4082	B
so uh uh well give an example uh you- you- we'll go out of the printing media i know of cases where um for example in television media where they'll show clippings from	4082	B
one event and describe another event but with the attempt to give you the impression that what they're talking about is the same thing that they're showing you	4082	B
which is sort of like a deliberate bias um which is which is rather disturbing i know ABC does that	4082	B
yeah i don't have access either although i did at one time and uh it was- i did during the Gulf War and it was addictive	4082	B
yeah well during that small sample i would say that everyone was just about just about the same except the three networks who also had radio then television programming so if at a particular time you wanted to get	4082	B
the latest and greatest news you could do that by um turning on CNN and you would-	4082	B
uh i get most of my news uh from newspapers really i read the daily newspaper uh the Houston Chronicle and sometimes i'll read uh like the uh	4082	A
uh Wall Street Journal or The New York Times i don't subscribe to either but sometimes i get a hold of copies of it um how about_1 you do you you mostly get news from TV or newspaper	4082	A
oh uh that's interesting you said computer networks um what uh what sort i'm fairly knowledgeable about oh okay that's interesting	4082	A
oh is-	4082	A
is it is it the AP news wire or is it uh something that's that's a little bit different from that	4082	A
uh okay so that that that's interesting okay yeah i've had i had access in the past to uh uh the AP news wire and i found that was that was pretty a pretty good way to get news	4082	A
um i've never uh used the Dow Jones news wire	4082	A
but uh yeah it uh do you do you get any uh do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of like a broader like more long term analytical sort of approach	4082	A
yeah	4082	A
uh interesting in what way in like in sort of like uh a quality- a quality or sort of the orientation in terms of like view point or the way the news is presented or whatever	4082	A
yeah like liberal- a liberal type of bias	4082	A
yeah	4082	A
yeah yeah	4082	A
yeah yeah	4082	A
yeah yeah they generally make mistake on anything technical at least but	4082	A
yeah	4082	A
yeah yeah do you by mistakes do you do you mean just like honest mistakes or do you think they're deliberate sorts of things	4082	A
yeah yeah	4082	A
yeah	4082	A
hm	4082	A
hm that's disturbing uh	4082	A
i haven't really noticed them doing that but	4082	A
whatever again i don't watch TV news that much now if i had access to CNN i would watch TV news more um i don't you know but i don't usually yeah	4082	A
yeah did you did you think that CNN well the Gulf War coverage would be kind of uh uh abnormality i just wonder- i guess	4082	A
i'd be curious to know what you thought as to as to how like say CNN TV news compared to the three networks	4082	A
um you know whether you thought it was more or less biased or whatever but i- i guess you wouldn't you probably if you just watched it during Gulf War that probably wouldn't wouldn't tell you much	4082	A
yeah	4082	A
yeah	4082	A
oh you are	4042	A
you're you're into uh recycling	4042	A
um-hum what materials do you recycle	4042	A
um-hum	4042	A
um-hum	4042	A
so	4042	A
so you're trying to take action to have that changed	4042	A
um-hum	4042	A
right so economically it's not a situation where you're going be able to attract a lot of attention	4042	A
right	4042	A
um-hum	4042	A
well i think um that is kind of becoming one of the drivers now the fact that with all the recycling that took place the price per pound has declined i know aluminum in our area one year ago aluminum was	4042	A
forty five cents a pound and now it's twenty last time i went it was twenty two cents a pound	4042	A
so it uh there's not a lot of money to be made but it's just a question of trying to help the environment	4042	A
um-hum	4042	A
right	4042	A
hm yeah where where i work we recycle paper that's about it	4042	A
yeah any any um noncolored- noncolored or {nonfilm} type paper just white paper and that sort of thing	4042	A
and	4042	A
uh	4042	A
oh we don't use that kind of paper any more no we have perforated	4042	A
for personal printers and then like LaserJet type paper	4042	A
we don't use the green bar type paper any more	4042	A
right	4042	A
um-hum	4042	A
well i would guess that your church is probably at a point where they're not really breaking even on their recycling	4042	A
i mean	4042	A
unless they get volunteers who have people who have trucks and that sort of thing	4042	A
um-hum	4042	A
um-hum	4042	A
right well there are neighborhoods in the Atlanta area where uh you have specific trash bins to put recyclables in and then they're collected on a regular basis	4042	A
right	4042	A
right	4042	A
right	4042	A
topic is recycling today	4042	B
and actually i'm pretty hot about the topic right now yes i am	4042	B
i'm into recycling i've got several friends who use me as their recycling drop off matter of fact	4042	B
i recycle glass plastic and aluminum	4042	B
also paper and plastic bags	4042	B
and i uh in Dallas we recently had a report on the news in the evening	4042	B
about what's being done with the recycled the recycling materials	4042	B
and green glass and several other items but green glass in particular is being tossed into the landfills	4042	B
and i got really hot about that because my husband- my husband drinks a lot of ginger ale and it's packed in green glass	4042	B
well yeah i'm i'm racking my brain thinking okay where can i what can i do to take action on this the only recycling plant i think in the south is in Atlanta	4042	B
and they're paying i think	4042	B
eighteen cents	4042	B
for every hundred pounds of green glass	4042	B
no i'm not but i've got	4042	B
good gosh i've got probably	4042	B
twenty or thirty pounds of it in my yard right now	4042	B
waiting for a recycling place to take it to and	4042	B
i would really be disturbed if i found out that the place i took it to	4042	B
was going to just put it in the landfill i mean i could have done that	4042	B
yeah	4042	B
um-hum	4042	B
no	4042	B
well that's the that's the thing is i uh i would rather help my environment and uh when i turn in glass and aluminum i turn it in to my church which has a community center	4042	B
and the community center uses the money to help with an after school program to help keep kids off the streets and to to give them a fighting chance in the world	4042	B
in regards to education and i think that's a real worthwhile project and	4042	B
that's really what got me started recycling was this uh community center	4042	B
so	4042	B
do you which kind of paper- computer paper	4042	B
oh any	4042	B
uh-huh	4042	B
oh uh-huh but do they recycle computer paper	4042	B
i mean like the the green and white barred	4042	B
oh you don't use that paper okay	4042	B
oh yeah uh-huh	4042	B
the old the old green bars um-hum	4042	B
yeah because_1 our our church also recycles computer paper and	4042	B
i don't know why i was thinking it was just the old green bar style as opposed to	4042	B
even the personal	4042	B
uh letter sized	4042	B
uh well	4042	B
yeah we have volunteers and there's not that it's	4042	B
not that wide of a participation- participation just yet	4042	B
so although with my friends helping we we contribute quite a bit of glass we all have children and	4042	B
quite a few of the children are in baby food	4042	B
and those baby food jars believe it or not really add up fast	4042	B
so	4042	B
oh yeah curbside recycling	4042	B
yeah they have that in Houston and in Dallas	4042	B
and i saw another report where in Houston they take the bins	4042	B
and they load them_1 up into the truck in the separate areas in the truck	4042	B
and the truck goes and dumps all of it into one landfill	4042	B
that got me heated up too	4042	B
that got me real heated up a friend of my mother's told her about that and she was telling me about it and then i saw a report on TV too	4042	B
and i thought why are we going through this trouble	4042	B
and i had a report tell me why we are we go through the trouble because everybody's worried about the environment	4042	B
and now that we have uh the the smaller the lay people worried about the environment	4042	B
now we have to get the businesses worried about using the recycled product	4042	B
that not that many businesses are	4042	B
you said you're are financial- uh financial planner so do you work with individual um	4000	A
like companies or i mean	4000	A
so how do you handle your own account	4000	A
your your own budget	4000	A
hm right now i think really the only debt we have is our house and	4000	A
well good but we really don't have a monthly budget that we live on but we don't spend	4000	A
um frivolously either	4000	A
uh i mean we don't i don't we don't have anything on the computer that says oops we only have five dollars left to spend this week you know it's not that rigid um	4000	A
hm um i know though i'm expecting and um we're thinking about cutting down to one salary and so when it comes down to that that is going to be quite a change in our	4000	A
income because_1 i not quite fifty percent but maybe forty percent of our income is based on mine um	4000	A
uh trying to decide well do we go ahead and get another car or do we just drive this one till it breaks	4000	A
you know and if we do what kind of car do we want to get and if we do do we should we pay cash for it or uh try to get a low interest	4000	A
you- you know interest rate	4000	A
we both have done that um we both work at companies that have credit unions	4000	A
so we had direct deposit you know for our car payment anyway and when my car was paid off i never told them to	4000	A
you know to stop taking that money out so they've still been putting in oh i don't remember how much my payments were two hundred and fifty three hundred dollars	4000	A
oh good smart budgeting is that what you said or just smart	4000	A
um	4000	A
and then my husband has done the same thing with his payments	4000	A
so it's just more to us not necessarily setting up for another car but just going into savings	4000	A
and i- i think our thing right now is the way the interest rates are and- uh	4000	A
well that's in our goals i guess for this year- first quarter is to examine our financial	4000	A
standing you know and try to decide how we want to invest our money because right now the the uh interest rates on everything seems to be so low that you know i don't really see any benefit over um uh	4000	A
oh i can't remember what we compared it to but over putting your money in say a CD or market money account or something over just a regular savings there wasn't enough difference	4000	A
in the interest rate to make a different i mean to uh i mean i guess our savings account is probably a lot more liquid than CDs or or um	4000	A
money money markets i don't know what else there i know there are a bunch of different things you can invest in but	4000	A
right now i don't know what do you think the way things are going right now	4000	A
that	4000	A
right	4000	A
right	4000	A
yes	4000	B
well we work with both we work with individuals and we work with companies and executives and um we do business and personal	4000	B
uh financial planning and budgeting and investing for those people	4000	B
how do i handle my own account	4000	B
uh well the first part of being- of of a good budget or a good financial planner is to uh number one don't have any debt	4000	B
so yes being debt free is very important and keeping a budget uh below your income is important also	4000	B
oh that's great you're ahead of most of the people out there then	4000	B
uh-huh	4000	B
well a budget does not have to be rigid	4000	B
sure	4000	B
um-hum	4000	B
right	4000	B
well uh one thing that really uh helps i find in budgeting and personally in budget as well as a business budget is prior planning prevents poor results	4000	B
and uh lot of people uh have not even considered that maybe that a car payment a monthly car payment that they put it in every month whether they have a car payment or not	4000	B
and therefore they would save up enough money over a couple year period to replace a vehicle when they needed it	4000	B
uh-huh	4000	B
well that is called smart budgeting	4000	B
oh it's real financial planning but we're talking about budgeting so	4000	B
that is very smart to do	4000	B
uh-huh	4000	B
right	4000	B
right	4000	B
well uh um with the economy the way it is it's very important that um we don't spend capital we don't have to because we don't know when we'll need it	4000	B
and secondly is is that we need to make our money work for us so we don't have to work harder	4000	B
and uh it just takes time to do that and um if a person has capital resources uh or cash on hand to take care of emergencies-	4000	B
well yeah i uh	4030	B
and i'm i'm sure there's things going on that that uh we don't know about but but uh it	4030	B
a year a year ago now when the the war Desert Storm was finishing up seems like things were uh	4030	B
going to settle down and nothing seems to of seems to have settled down after all i've	4030	B
um-hum	4030	B
yeah right	4030	B
right	4030	B
yeah and and i- i think there's a	4030	B
yeah i- i- i i have very much doubt that	4030	B
that there's a real understanding at the top levels of of the of the cultures and of what's going on	4030	B
in terms of and and it seems to me that our policy basically seems to be uh the enemy of my enemy is my friend	4030	B
and that that	4030	B
Saddam Hussein was uh was our buddy buddy as long as he was against Iran	4030	B
and uh Iran was our bigger enemy and then when it turns out that uh Saddam Hussein	4030	B
right	4030	B
right	4030	B
and	4030	B
right- oh yes yes and when we decided Saddam Hussein was our enemy then the uh uh	4030	B
oh what's his name in uh Syria uh	4030	B
uh Hafaia Susaad i believe uh is suddenly our friend even though he was he was on our our leading terrorist yeah our leading terrorist list so uh	4030	B
you know and	4030	B
right	4030	B
right right and and uh	4030	B
i think we're trying to we're trying to extricate ourselves somewhat from being	4030	B
so definitely tied to to the Israeli side in terms of all of that Israeli versus Arab	4030	B
and uh	4030	B
i haven't seen uh solid evidence yet that we're doing a really good job of that yeah yeah so	4030	B
right	4030	B
right	4030	B
right and	4030	B
yes	4030	B
yeah well it it	4030	B
from what yeah from what little i heard in terms the the the most understanding	4030	B
to get really cynical about it the most understanding uh	4030	B
i uh felt that was displayed in terms of of uh Iraq in particular	4030	B
was that it seemed to me that George Bush was was trying to play the peacemaker in such a way that	4030	B
that he was guaranteeing that given their culture that Saddam Hussein could not back down and would not could not do anything but go to war	4030	B
and and that uh	4030	B
uh oh boy	4030	B
oh that must have been that yes that must have been really fascinating- fascinating watching	4030	B
yes	4030	B
yeah	4030	B
right	4030	B
right	4030	B
yes	4030	B
yes	4030	B
well we in our country seems to be involved a lot in the Mid East what do you what do you think	4030	A
yeah	4030	A
it that that happens a lot doesn't it	4030	A
wars don't usually settle things much	4030	A
um um and i i guess i i feel like we	4030	A
we keep getting into places without really understanding what we're doing	4030	A
uh which really i find upsetting because it seems like we've got experts	4030	A
and we've got people who understand these cultures but i always wonder if they're really used because it seems like then afterwards we have people explaining to us how if they'd only known such and such	4030	A
we wouldn't have done this you know	4030	A
and would	4030	A
uh-huh	4030	A
yes	4030	A
uh-huh	4030	A
yeah	4030	A
but Iran of course used to be our friend	4030	A
i mean we can't it's a little hard to keep it straight isn't it	4030	A
oh	4030	A
yeah um	4030	A
right	4030	A
on our hit- on our really bad list	4030	A
and i i i keep reading about Jordan's King Hussein and i just feel so sorry for him sort of in the middle of all of this trying to keep some sort of sanity living vulnerable right where he is	4030	A
right- yes yes right	4030	A
right	4030	A
of doing that either no no i i i i just get a sense of our	4030	A
walking in over and over and over again in places where we weren't well versed or something	4030	A
didn't didn't know what we were doing so i mean it just feels unprepared or	4030	A
something and and if we could it's not wise that i guess i'm still looking for a statesman	4030	A
you know someone who really the the the kind of stories you hear about or you look back in history these people really understood what they're doing and did this wise thing every once in a while	4030	A
and i just keep thinking i know there with all the resources we have there must be people who could have explained some of this and said if you do this subtle thing understanding their culture et cetera et cetera it'll have this effect but	4030	A
oh absolutely yes	4030	A
i mean which- which was uh in the line of business that i'm in which is mediation	4030	A
every absolutely everything he did i mean i was in the classrooms teaching children about how to do negotiating and mediating and every single thing we did was against every principle i was teaching it was like	4030	A
um	4030	A
yes	4030	A
it was emotionally quite difficult uh to say the least because it's sort of like	4030	A
golly gee this is a set up for absolutely the worst chance	4030	A
possible what are what are we doing here you back someone in the corner is it too surprising if they come out fighting	4030	A
i mean uh ah didn't you ever see that with children i mean don't	4030	A
i i saw- i i did see one of the peace rallies where they just said i can't remember the exact thing it was	4030	A
something like George and Saddam- and Saddam go home	4030	A
well let's see uh yeah i think taxes are high but uh	4070	B
yeah maybe in some cases they're not high enough for instance uh	4070	B
here in my state uh	4070	B
yeah we do yeah but the but the reason the sales tax is high is because we don't have an income tax	4070	B
and uh you know we don't have an income tax because uh basically nobody- nobody wants any new taxes but the upshot is that we can't properly fund uh education here	4070	B
yeah so like the amount that we spend on education here in uh in the state of Washington per uh per student	4070	B
is is actually in the in the lower percentile uh i mean is is is low it we're we're ranked fairly low	4070	B
uh per fifty states yet uh you know yet we expect a lot out of the schools you know we've got here in the Seattle area we've got a lot of uh	4070	B
uh high technology industries we've got Microsoft here well Microsoft expects well educated employees	4070	B
but uh you know Microsoft is only paying property taxes towards uh	4070	B
towards uh towards schools so and there are those that argue well they waste too much money in schools or those or there there's	4070	B
you know more money doesn't solve the problem but i feel like in public schools that they uh	4070	B
uh that they really don't fund it they they don't basically fund it very well	4070	B
well it's cheaper to to educate uh people who are in the top ten percent than it is to have to educate the handicapped and the developmentally disabled and all that stuff	4070	B
yeah that's i've i've been hearing that that's uh that that's been going down and uh i don't know what uh what all the reasons are for that	4070	B
well i definitely think taxes are too high	4070	A
uh taxes at all levels uh state local and federal are over fifty percent of many people's uh income now	4070	A
and uh the amazing thing is to think that one of the primary reasons for the Boston Tea Party and the American Revolution was exorbitant taxes	4070	A
but for them exorbitant taxes were under ten percent it was ridiculous- you know uh that that uh we we took such drastic action over taxes	4070	A
uh and it's so much worse now but people are just apathetic about it and sit back and do nothing	4070	A
you have a real high sales tax there if i recall	4070	A
uh-huh	4070	A
oh really	4070	A
<b_aside> get out of my room <e_aside>	4070	A
interesting	4070	A
sure	4070	A
my my feeling about at least i I don't know if we want to get off the subject of taxes and on to the subject of schools but around here	4070	A
uh some of the public schools get more funds than	4070	A
the private schools uh in terms of you know the per student expenditure at say Carver High School in Atlanta is over eleven thousand dollars per student	4070	A
but the best private school	4070	A
is uh has a tuition of only seven thousand and all of their students of course rank consistently in the top ten percent on the SAT etcetera and the the public school that gets uh quite a bit more money	4070	A
just doesn't uh doesn't turn out that quality of student and	4070	A
yeah but i think a lot of it is just that uh the money is wasted on bureaucracy and it's not very efficient um	4070	A
uh we we have you know a state department of education and things which	4070	A
all all they do is do statistics and push paper around and none of the uh one of the things that's happened here is that uh the percentage of the money going to instruction	4070	A
meaning teacher's salaries and books and materials has been falling even though that the uh total funding has been going up	4070	A
uh so that uh you know whereas twenty years ago seventy percent of the money going to schools	4070	A
went to teacher's salaries and books and materials now it's only forty five percent and that's really scary to think that uh	4070	A
yeah i think that uh one of the reasons our taxes are so high is just that uh	4070	A
on on top of the inefficiencies like what i just described is the government tries to do too many things that the government has no business doing you know we're spending	4070	A
a couple a hundred billion dollars a year to maintain troops in Europe and Asia uh we have no business spending that money	4070	A
and uh we're spending over two hundred billion dollars a year on interest on the debt uh there was a Presidential candidate forum here	4070	A
last Saturday and just- we just had our primary in Georgia and uh	4070	A
uh you know i I one of the questions i asked the representative of Bob Carey who was there was uh	4070	A
and we have a projected four hundred billion dollar budget deficit this year	4070	A
what are you gonna do to to correct that and all he talked- and and all they could say all the is the only thing he would do is consolidate some cabinet-	4070	A
well during- see i'm going to school right now and uh while i'm working i don't get a i don't get a chance to read the paper a lot	4033	B
and i don't watch TV as much really either because uh my free time is kind of and i do like to do other stuff with it while i'm at work sometimes i on the computer network um	4033	B
i read the news sometimes and that's kind of helpful	4033	B
that's true i mean my roommates and stuff you know	4033	B
people around me talk about it and the people i work with are pretty you know up up-to-date on that kind of stuff so	4033	B
uh-huh	4033	B
yeah	4033	B
do you watch do you watch the network like major network news or do you watch like the McNeil Lehrer Hour	4033	B
oh really	4033	B
uh-huh oh channel- see channel where i am channel eight's um like public TV so it's kind of different	4033	B
i think i think the uh	4033	B
i think a lot of the commentators on like the major networks like right it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on but um it seems that um	4033	B
they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they you know report on the news	4033	B
yeah	4033	B
yeah exactly	4033	B
uh-huh uh because they can they can only report on i mean they give each candidate perhaps you know ten second blurbs in which to you know to say	4033	B
you you just can't get a full picture of you know their message unless you have time to sit down and read- and probably read something on it	4033	B
yeah	4033	B
yeah	4033	B
what kind of uh see i subscribe to like Science News and that's that's real good because it gives like a brief summary of all like the updates like of what's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would you know bog me down that i wouldn't know about	4033	B
but other than that i don't really read- i don't i don't really subscribe to anything else	4033	B
uh-huh	4033	B
oh yeah	4033	B
yeah	4033	B
yeah	4033	B
well i remember during- back during the uh during the war everyone here at work always had the radio or the TV on because_1 that they were going constantly with that stuff	4033	B
but uh	4033	B
yeah	4033	B
if they reported every murder- if they reported every violent crime in Atlanta it would take it would probably take the whole news hour but uh	4033	B
oh yeah that's they still already they're having like um in the newspaper they have a section i think every now and then on- on the Olympics you know and they've got like a countdown it's like sixteen hundred days or something	4033	B
oh really that's gonna be crazy that time of year here but uh	4033	B
i can't believe i mean they're they're uh stretching out the Olympic news for that much coverage over	4033	B
i guess people want to hear about it also big in big in the news right now is the Braves because they're uh they're in you know training- spring training or whatever and they did so well last year	4033	B
yeah it seems like	4033	B
i don't know it's they way they do the newscasts uh i wish they they kind of separated it you know or if you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to some- some channel for it but i don't have cable	4033	B
so how do you get most of your current event information	4033	A
uh-huh	4033	A
right	4033	A
um-hum	4033	A
i would imagine going to college though your professors and different things you keep up on what's going on	4033	A
yeah	4033	A
right well i'm a housewife i have three kids and so um i get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock and then um	4033	A
talking with people and just hearing what's going on but	4033	A
just the regular channel just channel eight that's our channel here that's the um eyewitness news	4033	A
so	4033	A
oh uh-huh yeah	4033	A
right and i think even in the elections they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not and basically you know if a candidate- candidate can get them to follow then the news will	4033	A
you know kind of publicize his name	4033	A
i don't think that the way i get the news is the right way to get it i think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on	4033	A
right	4033	A
right and the news too it just doesn't um cover all- that many stories i mean it just covers your basic you know violent crimes	4033	A
and you know and and your catastrophes- catastrophes with weather and stuff but other than that you really don't know what's going on	4033	A
um i will read our current letters that come out on elections and i guess i do read that and i do study who's running in our area and i do study what's going on in the economy	4033	A
it you know and i guess i do read other magazines um too to get my information	4033	A
right i	4033	A
i used to read every month a Reader's Digest	4033	A
but um now i guess i just have friends that clip articles or if i you know am interested in something of course during the war- when we were in war i read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on but a lot of the times	4033	A
i you know i wish i had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper but i just can't seem to find the time if they'd put it out in a video or on not a video but a cassette tape or something where you could just listen to it i would do that while i was doing other things	4033	A
but	4033	A
right	4033	A
well i um they even did a story on our news here in Texas on what people wanted to see more of and people said that they wanted to see more on	4033	A
outside of Texas news you know we just don't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in Dallas	4033	A
that we want to hear what's going on with the economy what's being done to help it what's going on in other countries what's you know just more information	4033	A
yeah well i guess you'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the uh summer Olympics	4033	A
i know we're trying to get tickets to it right now yeah	4033	A
yeah	4033	A
right right yeah they spent a lot of time that's another thing they spend a long time on sports and i think that um that's fine i would like to see more time spent on other things but	4033	A
okay	4099	B
yeah yeah well first of all i i have- have to ask you how how old you are	4099	B
twenty seven okay yeah well i am quite a bit older than you are but no i i think exercise is extremely important and i i do exercise on a regular basis	4099	B
well i do um {jazzercise} which is an aerobic um	4099	B
program that are you familiar with it	4099	B
it's uh you know a national company and we have a {jazzercise} center here in Plano that has classes like all day long so you can	4099	B
no it's really it's it's an aerobic routine you you warm up and then you have thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting you know slowly and then working up to uh you know a high heart rate and then you gradually go down again	4099	B
no i only do it probably two or three times a week	4099	B
the minimum they want you to do is three times a week	4099	B
well it's really a	4099	B
i mean it's called a center and you buy as many classes as you want to a time and then you just go in whenever you can	4099	B
so like i usually choose to go like at nine thirty in the morning or or a nine fifteen class or a ten thirty class in the mornings	4099	B
no i go by myself and- and that's one of the frustrating things cause i can find very few people to go with me	4099	B
and most of my friends that are my age don't exercise or they might play tennis	4099	B
and since i am not a tennis player um you know i don't get that but i am you know i am between i am in my late forties so um there aren't many people you know that want to do that most of the people that are in the classes are young mothers	4099	B
you know with with children between the ages	4099	B
young mothers you know young women with with small children are the ones that i find well what do you do	4099	B
oh great	4099	B
yeah so you play everyday	4099	B
well now who do you play with do you have friends that play with you or just	4099	B
you know	4099	B
yeah	4099	B
well see that's that's that's really good and i think that keeps a lot some people from exercising	4099	B
i mean i don't have a problem with weight either but i think i don't have a problem because i exercise you know i mean people are always saying to me how do you stay thin and it's because i exercise but i also watch what i eat	4099	B
you know but you'll come being- being twenty seven you don't really have to worry about your heart rate and that yet but as you get older you will	4099	B
well it might not it might not- because everybody's been telling me that too and so far it hasn't happened you know and i	4099	B
i just feel like you know you have to constantly weigh yourself	4099	B
and just keep an eye on it and cut back if it starts to get you know too high	4099	B
yeah but you don't play any other sports but basketball	4099	B
but do you ski being in Utah i was wondering if you skied	4099	B
oh did it really	4099	B
because_1 i know that skiing in Utah is is suppose to be great	4099	B
yeah	4099	B
yeah well i have never skied before but i have friends that go to Utah all the time and they think it's really and they ski i guess there's a place where you can ski where was it Tahoe where you ski from	4099	B
no that's Nevada to California i guess yeah i am thinking about where you can ski over the state line	4099	B
but there's a funny- there is a place in Utah called a funny name	4099	B
but it's like oh Heavenly is that it	4099	B
yeah i think it's called Heavenly	4099	B
you've never heard of that	4099	B
well maybe it isn't in Utah i don't know	4099	B
oh yeah you can get really sore i know you i can- mean i've talked to people but most of these people ski enough so that they don't get sore	4099	B
and	4099	B
and then is it your- your quadriceps that are this worst you mean your legs and	4099	B
yeah	4099	B
yeah	4099	B
well and it's strange that like you can do like i did aerobics you know all the time and then i went horseback riding	4099	B
and still i was so sore and i couldn't get over	4099	B
-okay i guess we're talking about exercise huh	4099	A
oh i am twenty seven	4099	A
you do what type of exercise do you do	4099	A
oh you do	4099	A
yes	4099	A
is that different from aerobics or is it the same thing	4099	A
and you do that every day	4099	A
oh okay	4099	A
oh and this is a club or uh do you belong to a a group	4099	A
do you go with friends or do you go alone	4099	A
yeah	4099	A
uh-huh	4099	A
um-hum	4099	A
oh	4099	A
oh yeah young mothers or yeah	4099	A
uh-huh	4099	A
uh-huh	4099	A
uh i really don't have a routine i like playing basketball we just bought a new home with a basketball hoop and that's what i do everyday	4099	A
yeah pretty much when my wife let's me	4099	A
no i just shoot around by myself	4099	A
and uh that's about it i use to play soccer a lot in high school but when i graduated i haven't done much i don't have a problem i know i have to do more aerobics but i don't have a problem with weight i could eat all day and not gain an ounce	4099	A
uh-huh	4099	A
you do exercises	4099	A
you do exercise-	4099	A
uh-huh	4099	A
yeah and i	4099	A
well everyone's told me my waist line is going to expand one of these days but	4099	A
i don't know	4099	A
uh-huh	4099	A
yeah i guess i enjoy sports a lot so that's why i've kept active in that way	4099	A
uh basketball volleyball um	4099	A
just about it just not really heavy just as far as recreation or hobby i do that	4099	A
um i used to but it got too expensive so	4099	A
yeah	4099	A
yeah a lot of people do that	4099	A
and but well i just i never find the time i had rather do other things	4099	A
oh they come up here	4099	A
that's in Nevada uh-huh	4099	A
oh yeah but	4099	A
there's Snow Bird or Alta	4099	A
Heavenly	4099	A
huh i've never heard of that one huh-uh	4099	A
do they exercise much or i mean for skiing i know when i went you can get sore easily but	4099	A
oh yeah see i'm this one or two timer a year if i do go and i am really sore after	4099	A
yeah	4099	A
my legs really really ache	4099	A
but that's i am using muscles that i have never used before	4099	A
um i really haven't had uh too many problems uh seems to me that everything that i buy	4026	B
goes bad just after the warranty runs out	4026	B
yeah i've had a dryer an ice maker a microwave	4026	B
all three and they unfortunately i bought them_1 all three at the same time when i bought my new house and uh	4026	B
i really don't have any recourse so i had to call and have them_1 all repaired and that	4026	B
yeah it was a hassle	4026	B
yeah the warranty on the refrigerator uh the ice- the refrigerator warranty's still good but the ice maker itself	4026	B
lasted three years and it was three years and two months	4026	B
no	4026	B
uh watch out	4026	B
um-hum	4026	B
hm	4026	B
i usually have pretty good luck with appliances but	4026	B
i just uh it was within two days that all three of these stopped working and the	4026	B
the ice maker was uh had to have a new pump and the uh	4026	B
microwave had to have uh some kind of something i can't even pronounce and they uh	4026	B
the dryer had to have a new heating element so it was about almost three hundred dollars for all three of them_1	4026	B
uh within two days of each other	4026	B
i was	4026	B
it wasn't a good week i was pretty mad	4026	B
and plus the place that i'd bought um them all had gone out of business so	4026	B
even if uh i think even if i had uh	4026	B
had kept the warranty the service agreements were	4026	B
with the companies that that manufactured but still they were through that	4026	B
retailer so i don't know if i could've taken it to another retailer or not	4026	B
but i didn't have to worry about all that because	4026	B
they weren't under warranty	4026	B
so	4026	B
it was a call to the local appliance dealer	4026	B
who came out and fixed them_1 all but	4026	B
i the only other things that i've ever had trouble with um	4026	B
i seem to have a real bad trouble with electric hair dryers blow dryers	4026	B
yeah i've had two or three of those go out one was under warranty and	4026	B
the other two weren't but i just	4026	B
other than that you know TVs and	4026	B
things like that i haven't ever had any trouble with i don't think products are getting much better though	4026	B
oh really that's interesting	4026	B
do you do you test each individual one or do you just test	4026	B
like if you've got ten you test one and by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay	4026	B
um-hum	4026	B
well that's something i've never had to use it's never i've never been involved in an automobile accident so	4026	B
luckily that's a product that i haven't had to test	4026	B
but i think it's a great idea i'm i'm	4026	B
seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to	4026	B
to come about but that	4026	B
oh i'm sure they wanna be thorough before they but uh even you know i don't mind spending the extra money on the car	4026	B
if you know even if they pass the savings the cost onto the consumer because	4026	B
it just seems like a real worthwhile thing i'm not a real big seat belt my uh	4026	B
oh how's your products been	4026	A
i hear that one have you had any lately go out	4026	A
oh wow	4026	A
so you didn't get anything even all the all the warranties were out	4026	A
yeah	4026	A
the only thing i've had problems with is um i buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail and	4026	A
i bought this paint stripper where they advertise	4026	A
that it's nontoxic and such and when you get the product	4026	A
it ends up being toxic and all these warnings so	4026	A
i didn't return it because it'd probably cost me more than i just ended up using it	4026	A
but that's about the only thing i've had gone wrong	4026	A
that's incredible-	4026	A
and they all went out at the same time	4026	A
or two days	4026	A
wow	4026	A
wow that's frustrating	4026	A
uh-huh	4026	A
uh-huh they go out a lot	4026	A
yeah see i'm in the manufacturing field i -just home from work and make um automotive air bags the safety air bags	4026	A
yeah	4026	A
at Morton International and	4026	A
i think- well it's it's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment we test everything	4026	A
after each assembly process	4026	A
and so our testing is pretty thorough but	4026	A
um	4026	A
um the tests that well we test every one electrically we don't	4026	A
i think they test um four or five a day actually exploding the air bag	4026	A
and but we do test after during the assembly project- product um after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag we check to make sure it's there	4026	A
after we install it so each assembly process has an inspection right after it's done	4026	A
and then we do electrical tests on them_1 during the process so	4026	A
yeah	4026	A
well they do the all the testing that we have to do through the government	4026	A
it's incredible how much testing they have to do	4026	A
uh-huh	4026	A
uh i would say the medical uh group insurance uh area as far as uh	4028	B
covering medical costs for yourself or family members	4028	B
yeah i think- i work for a a public school system district and uh so it's different than a company where	4028	B
most companies fund almost the entire thing where the school district does um	4028	B
the employee must pick up	4028	B
a greater figure in the way of uh costs but it- overall um i've been pleased with it over the years i think the biggest frustration	4028	B
is because of the cost of insurance	4028	B
going up every year our district has had to alter uh you know change companies or now we're on a managed care thing which has stressed a lot of people out although	4028	B
it has not disturbed me any how about_1 yourself	4028	B
uh-huh	4028	B
right yeah our district did that	4028	B
for the ninety one and the ninety school year or calendar years and i was in the HMO and um	4028	B
i- i was because my my same doctor you know agreed to be in it for uh they usually sign a contract or something and um	4028	B
uh	4028	B
i did have surgery last summer and i paid ten dollars when i went to see him that first day and i've never seen another bill so i- i have to say it really works but again	4028	B
i was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it uh if you've been going to a doctor for you know ten years or something and he elects not to join	4028	B
it can be very stressful for you know those people	4028	B
uh-huh	4028	B
yeah	4028	B
right but if you you know have a family and and um	4028	B
everybody's gone to different doctors uh it is hard to give up somebody who you feel	4028	B
knows you and your body and your just has you know all the medical history and you feel comfortable with it i i'm sure it would be very stressful and	4028	B
my husband and i have just elected that if that happens i will go and just pay you can continue to go to your own doctor but your benefits are not as	4028	B
you know good so	4028	B
uh	4028	B
oh all right	4028	B
i do too are you talking about like spring break and right	4028	B
right	4028	B
it it really um	4028	B
i don't think	4028	B
most of our teachers now i'm not a teacher i am the a secretarial executive assistant but	4028	B
i don't think the teachers could stand the stress all all year long frankly it is just	4028	B
Texas has really um	4028	B
you know they want everybody educated no matter what it's costs uh and it it would be just	4028	B
we all look forward to like in two weeks we have spring break and i don't know who looks forward to it more the students or the or the teachers and the staff what do you do there	4028	B
okay i like-	4028	B
well that's good yeah i would think that that type of	4028	B
employment you're you're	4028	B
one day you might be really tuned in and the next day oh a little lukewarm or something and and um	4028	B
you know it's good that they allow you that	4028	B
it um as- i say the schools now we do have to work you know the day but we do get	4028	B
many days off and um	4028	B
we all look forward to it that's only reason i work there is that my children now have graduated and graduated from college but at the time	4028	B
i worked there because my hours and days were the same as theirs and uh i've just	4028	B
continued to uh stay there	4028	B
so	4028	B
okay um i guess we're going to talk describe uh job benefits and so what do you think uh next to salary do you rank is the most important job benefits	4028	A
uh-huh	4028	A
um-hum	4028	A
well um does your company have good benefits in that in that regard	4028	A
uh-huh	4028	A
oh yeah	4028	A
um-hum	4028	A
hm	4028	A
i see	4028	A
uh well i'm my medical coverage is with an HMO um so	4028	A
that's in my opinion that's getting- that's bordering on a health clinic but it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage um	4028	A
um-hum	4028	A
right	4028	A
yes	4028	A
that's right yeah i'm i'm fairly young myself i've only been	4028	A
when i first started working which three years ago is when i first got into full time employment	4028	A
and uh at that time i immediately joined the HMO and i never really	4028	A
so the only doctor i i've kind of consistently had has been through the HMO and uh you know for me it's worked out real good	4028	A
um-hum	4028	A
hm	4028	A
um-hum	4028	A
yeah um like you you mentioned you work for a school system i work for uh Georgia Tech in the research branch and i guess	4028	A
another one that that that i rank up there high is the uh kind of job flexibility and time off um i enjoy as a as a benefit	4028	A
right yeah getting a lot of a lot of breaks between quarters and that and having a lot of vacation	4028	A
um-hum	4028	A
um-hum	4028	A
right	4028	A
well um i'm not actually on the teaching faculty but we have a large research organization associated with the university and that's who i work with	4028	A
um	4028	A
and we're given you know a good bit of flexibility in what we do we can kind of pursue our own interests in terms of the research areas that we study	4028	A
right	4028	A
right	4028	A
um-hum	4028	A
oh yeah	4028	A
um-hum	4028	A
okay_1 are there	4028	A
are there any things that that you'd like to see changed in terms of the the benefits-	4028	A
yeah i might as well uh one of the things i'm very concerned about the air pollution is the uh this this the ozone layer uh	4051	B
uh uh issue uh i used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of freon- different types of freons	4051	B
and it uh rather bothers me that uh i was in in effect uh contributing to the delinquency of the the environment so to speak	4051	B
right right and one of the reasons they fixed up the freons eleven twelve and thirteen in in in that area was because they were inexpensive uh they could be made uh you know cheap- inexpensive and lots of it	4051	B
uh and in that and its properties were great uh with uh the machinery didn't have to have lots of expensive machinery to uh get your heating and cooling cycles to work	4051	B
so	4051	B
well course there's only a a tremendous number of a refrigerators and freon- excuse me refrigerators and freezers	4051	B
both commercial and residential uh utilizing freon twelve and of course the the new cars i guess starting with nineteen- nineteen ninety three will not have freon twelve in their systems	4051	B
but uh there's you know there's the ton of after market machines and et cetera et cetera	4051	B
and that's got me very concerned- you know highly concerned that uh	4051	B
it's gonna be quite a while before we can uh	4051	B
undo this now that could spawn several good industries and help pull us out of this recession but you got to have people that can make you know earn a salary to pay for this conversion	4051	B
so we're so i see us in a kind somewhat of a catch twenty two unless we unless the banks or industry and or the government go together and and come up with a way to uh	4051	B
have us uh as a an unemployed- the part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into uh the new nonpolluting uh compound	4051	B
because as i say there is a there's a tremendous- well how many uh uh families own a refrigerator	4051	B
and then do you know that number and then how many own a a freezer separate from	4051	B
and how many people especially here in Texas own cars and trucks with air conditioning	4051	B
i mean this is there there are people that that make it have a thriving business uh that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on on automobiles and trucks	4051	B
and uh the only reason i didn't uh get into that more when i was had my little business was because uh most of your uh air conditioning in in on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the N-th degree	4051	B
so uh that's why i stayed in stayed more towards- towards uh	4051	B
uh and that's a polluting- polluting type deal too is the excessive um you know uh petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth and the dirt and grit and	4051	B
the those two mixed together with with water and uh really make a uh make a mess	4051	B
um-hum	4051	B
right	4051	B
well most	4051	B
most of the time when you see bus uh you know the buses with the diesel that's uh those are carbon particles and uh carbon dioxide and water vapor	4051	B
uh because when you when diesel- diesel is burned it's it you know diesel fuel is burned in a in a in the diesel engine it's burned so completely	4051	B
that you don't have any uh uh nitrous oxides uh or oxides of nitrogen uh to uh form	4051	B
because of by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine	4051	B
because_1 diesel oil is uh	4051	B
you know where gasoline if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it's gone	4051	B
diesel is going to be around because it doesn't evaporate easily	4051	B
and it's got uh you know it's it's latent heat is high but it's slow burning at at uh	4051	B
normal pressures that's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios	4051	B
as the as the air is heated you know by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio	4051	B
and so if it- the car sucks in uh fifty degrees	4051	B
okay_1 you wanna start	4051	A
uh-huh	4051	A
yeah now that's stuff we never even thought about three years ago	4051	A
uh-huh so have they stopped that practice now	4051	A
yeah yeah	4051	A
oh	4051	A
uh-huh	4051	A
yeah	4051	A
uh-huh	4051	A
um yeah	4051	A
yeah i hate to see a car going down the street or even a truck or bus for that matter that that's putting out a lot of dark	4051	A
smoke and i know there's a lot of pollutants we can't even see coming out of cars but that that particular bothers me	4051	A
uh-huh	4051	A
oh	4051	A
um-hum	4051	A
yeah	4051	A
oh i see	4051	A
um-hum	4051	A
uh-huh	4051	A
well uh i don't know that we really have a budget i have a set amount that i that i save actually well actually there is a a way uh we budget our our money apparently uh	4079	B
my wife uh	4079	B
has so much uh you know gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks and	4079	B
uh we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff gas and things like that and besides that i uh you know i have a set amount that i save every every month	4079	B
uh-huh	4079	B
uh-huh	4079	B
really don't need to	4079	B
uh	4079	B
that's right	4079	B
um-hum	4079	B
uh-huh	4079	B
right	4079	B
well i found that uh you know things- as as i've gotten older i'm in my fifties now but before we use to have to have to very- have a very strict budget i had four kids and uh	4079	B
you know we we planned out how much we're going to spend for food and how much for for this and for that and kind of anticipate how much things were going to be and	4079	B
uh i guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting i do now is that i set aside uh like i kind of fence off areas of my check book for instance there are certain things that i know -will come up uh every so often every six months i have to pay car insurance	4079	B
uh every six months i have to pay my taxes so i take a set amount i've got a money market account that i do a lot of uh saving in and i also have got a checking account besides that but	4079	B
what i do on my money market account for my taxes for instance which amount to uh an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month i'll just take two hundred and twenty out and i put it in parenthesis i take it out of the right line total	4079	B
and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up every month i add two hundred and twenty dollars to it and then when the tax bill comes in i've got that much set aside	4079	B
and i guess that's a way of budgeting	4079	B
um-hum	4079	B
uh-huh	4079	B
yeah uh cars are are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget not only for buying them_1 but for for keeping them_1 on the road too	4079	B
um	4079	B
you know we've got two cars my wife has a car and i and i like to drive a pick up truck so	4079	B
we're on a schedule where i try every uh three or four years to to buy a new one and you know i'm constantly making car payments but i figure that's got to be the story of my life anyway is making car payments	4079	B
so uh you know i get one paid for and uh actually i'm saving up for another one besides so	4079	B
it's	4079	B
you- you know it's it's kind of a never ending thing but you try to you try to schedule those things so that	4079	B
uh you're only- you're not paying for two at the same time i guess what i'm saying	4079	B
well i've thought about it but leasing wouldn't i you know i don't use it for my business my wife uses hers just for pleasure and i use mine just to go back and forth to work which is only ten miles away so	4079	B
yeah i guess uh	4079	B
uh-huh	4079	B
right	4079	B
yeah you're right um i- i have uh been know to keep	4079	B
trucks or cars for oh ten or twelve years but i find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill and you got to put put stuff into them_1 you know	4079	B
uh-huh	4079	B
um-hum	4079	B
those things can really upset your budget when they when they come in uh you know it's nice to have a little bit set aside for the for the unexpected shall we say	4079	B
so that it doesn't uh kill you all in one month	4079	B
okay_1 so Frank what uh type of uh	4079	A
budget do you or your family have	4079	A
right that's	4079	A
that's sounds like uh probably a tighter controlled budget than what i have i'm single so i guess	4079	A
uh i don't know if that's an excuse for not having a tight budget but i basically	4079	A
right i don't need to	4079	A
i'm the only that i have to keep track of so it makes it a little bit easier	4079	A
um and also i you know i try to save a certain amount each month as well and uh	4079	A
i kind of	4079	A
i kind of have an idea of what my expenses are and i i'm pretty consistent from month to month	4079	A
and uh whenever i need to uh you know whenever that changes i'm pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it	4079	A
um-hum	4079	A
um-hum	4079	A
right	4079	A
yeah that's	4079	A
i guess i kind of do a similar thing more medium- uh medium or longer range i just have a	4079	A
maybe a target amount that i'll save for like i'm probably within a year i'd like to buy a new car	4079	A
so i kind of have uh an amount in my mind and i'm making every effort to	4079	A
to put a little bit away and	4079	A
you know increase the amount i need for a down payment or whatever	4079	A
right	4079	A
um-hum	4079	A
hm	4079	A
right	4079	A
right	4079	A
have you thought about uh leasing	4079	A
i see	4079	A
right	4079	A
but if you're rolling it over every three years it might be advantageous to do that	4079	A
you know typically you if you purchase your own car you tend to make uh the best returns after you pay it off of course you know the longer you keep it beyond that point the more profitable it is to own it yourself	4079	A
that's right yeah mine's uh seven years old and i think last year was that was a rough year for it i had expenses- a number of expenses	4079	A
but uh i'm hoping that	4079	A
most- most of them_1 were just kind of uh you know the	4079	A
as you get to a certain number of miles you have to get everything replaced brake shocks and all that so i just went through that whole set last year	4079	A
and i'm hoping i'll be have a slow period before i need that again	4079	A
right	4079	A
right what line of work are you in	4079	A
i just just as i answered the phone there was there was a voice that came on the line and said	4066	B
you were suppose to you talk about capital punishment how does the law what uh how do the laws in the different states compare and to be restricted to certain crimes or certain circumstances or something like that	4066	B
i honestly don't know what Illinois' position on capital punishment is do you know for Texas	4066	B
uh-huh	4066	B
yeah i- i strongly- i i strongly agree i think uh well in general i think we have we have a fairly lax legal system as far as protecting the criminal	4066	B
and uh and i can see the the necessity of it	4066	B
but uh	4066	B
i don't know if someone's guilty and there's there's no question- if if if there's is no question about it a lot of times you sentence someone to prison and there and there the jury finds them guilt then not- in everyone's mind it's not actually settled	4066	B
so i can i can see letting uh letting for example the judge make the call or or maybe an appeals court make the call and on this it was this not just beyond a reasonable doubt but beyond any doubt	4066	B
and so under circumstances where it's you know where there is no question about it the person actually did kill somebody and in particularly particularly in some of the more brutal cases or prevalent or where they've killed several people	4066	B
yeah i i totally agree i i think it's kind of appalling that some one can commit murder and they know that they probably won't die for it	4066	B
is that right	4066	B
oh wow	4066	B
baby	4066	B
that's that's probably why this was picked as one of the topics because Texas Instruments is in Texas and so	4066	B
it's in the news it's not it's not really in the news much up here i guess it was the Dahlmer case	4066	B
that that was in the news everywhere	4066	B
now where was that at	4066	B
so that was in Texas too	4066	B
that's what i thought	4066	B
uh-huh	4066	B
i guess that would be that would be the issue and they just tie the child and and	4066	B
and were they were they punishing the kid and they didn't realize that he was going to die or oh they did	4066	B
well see that's i think i would think that differently they had two of them	4066	B
two children- two children	4066	B
one didn't	4066	B
huh	4066	B
yeah in that case he i think he could argue that i don't know if the parents were really intending to kill the kids	4066	B
that would that would seem- that would seem like that would that would i would have a harder time saying the death penalty was in order for that	4066	B
well	4066	B
no i- i certainly think punishment is in order but the death penalty because that's i am not sure that that's homicide because they didn't i i it's it was certainly wasn't intentional homicide	4066	B
yeah that's	4066	B
that is	4066	B
that is a tough one	4066	B
well	4066	A
yeah uh-huh	4066	A
well i know we're kind of beefing it up now uh the past year or so	4066	A
the people that are on death row and have been for years and years and years they're beginning to go on and executed them now We have the uh legal injections lethal injection	4066	A
and uh	4066	A
it's going to take at least all ready this year three have been put to death	4066	A
and i think at this point i am for that as long you know as they've had all the chances they need to have on appeals and	4066	A
this i don't see why they should have to and why why we should have to support them for twenty or thirty years on death row	4066	A
that once they have been sentenced by a jury of their peers found guilty and then gone through the appeal	4066	A
bit then	4066	A
why continue	4066	A
that's right	4066	A
right i can agree with that That it's	4066	A
right	4066	A
yes	4066	A
yes Well i know of uh at least two this year that have been put to death have uh i mean they have already they had admitted to it They i mean there was no question and yes they had been going on fifteen to twenty years there on death row	4066	A
and	4066	A
uh i think probably Texas is the most lax state there is on this that it just	4066	A
oh wow We do everything else fast	4066	A
right	4066	A
uh-huh	4066	A
uh-huh	4066	A
uh	4066	A
i think that was in Houston	4066	A
yes uh-huh	4066	A
i believe so and uh	4066	A
i know we're going through a case right now that uh where parent's starved a child to death	4066	A
and uh	4066	A
i've heard you know people wondering whether you know should these people get the death penalty or not	4066	A
uh i i guess i would feel strongly about that when it involves a child especially they they tied this child	4066	A
the police found the child tied and starved and uh there's no doubt a case like that there's no doubt in my mind	4066	A
that these people ought to get the death penalty	4066	A
that uh	4066	A
they did it they did it knowingly	4066	A
yes uh-huh	4066	A
oh they the were just punishing They didn't think far enough ahead i don't guess that you know that he would actually die or that they would get caught They had two of them	4066	A
uh-huh	4066	A
two children One did not die	4066	A
well could be	4066	A
well i don't think i would but uh	4066	A
uh-huh	4066	A
Well you may have a point there i	4066	A
it's just that i guess they have gotten so much publicity here but i've read so much about it and	4066	A
it just upsets me	4066	A
but but other than that uh you know i just	4066	A
okay so what do you think about uh	4067	A
uh health care for the elderly	4067	A
right	4067	A
all the bills	4067	A
does that include um	4067	A
nursing home type care	4067	A
just strictly health care	4067	A
right	4067	A
right	4067	A
that's hundred percent coverage so it's that's good	4067	A
hm	4067	A
um	4067	A
hm	4067	A
right	4067	A
so where does- does she well um	4067	A
i guess in terms of where do you is your mother now in a a nursing home is	4067	A
right i guess	4067	A
that's the big question is um what what happens when they begin to get older i have a grandmother and it she's not really	4067	A
uh you know she's getting to the point where she almost can't be in a nursing home she spent some time with my parents some time now she's with an uncle of mine living with them	4067	A
but she requires a lot of attention and she can't really exist on her own any longer	4067	A
and that's that's kind of a difficult situation that that she has to live with one of her children	4067	A
right	4067	A
yeah	4067	A
yeah my uh my grandmother is hers is physically she's in not too bad of shape she's in her upper eighties i guess forgetting in my order but uh she's uh Alzheimer's i guess	4067	A
and so her memory is very poor and so she can't really be on her own but she can still do things by herself but you just have to uh kind of direct her	4067	A
um-hum	4067	A
that's true	4067	A
well i've got a mom who is uh eighty six years old this year	4067	B
and uh	4067	B
she- she	4067	B
uh sometimes well she lived with us for a few years six- actually six years and then she moved	4067	B
uh to live with my bother because she got tired of teenagers but uh in my house	4067	B
uh i think health care for the elderly is uh	4067	B
is uh its kind of a difficult	4067	B
i say difficult i mean there's as your body is running downhill they can spend an infinite amount to keep you alive	4067	B
and on the other hand it's kind of nice uh	4067	B
if you're taking care of an elderly person to have somebody come along and pick up the the uh	4067	B
the tab the the one thing that that mom got into was that was pretty nice was an HMO they took all the money from from uh Medicare	4067	B
how should i say it uh this HMO thing said uh had an agreement with Medicare that said uh on the average you're gonna spend X amount of dollars per year	4067	B
so if you'll give us that money we promise to take care of of uh all the bills	4067	B
no this is just you know standard	4067	B
health care like you'd get from your employer	4067	B
and uh	4067	B
so at one point uh and and that was pretty good for her because uh	4067	B
there was a set of things that she knew she was covered for and uh and	4067	B
well it was close to a hundred percent there were things that they wouldn't cover but they like they bought her a uh	4067	B
a uh	4067	B
let's see they bought her a wheelchair and uh one one thing that was good about it was that it uh	4067	B
uh before that time she was always subject she she'd have these salesmen that would call and say hey if you'll just buy this handy dandy motorized uh easy chair for	4067	B
three times the the real price uh Medicare will pay for it and so she was always buying stuff that she didn't need	4067	B
and then finding out that Medicare was either going to pay just a small fraction or no Medicare wouldn't pay for it	4067	B
so it kind of put the uh salesmen at bay put it that way	4067	B
so how about_1 you	4067	B
no she's still she's staying with my uh actually she's staying with my	4067	B
brother's son who's doesn't have teenagers	4067	B
yeah	4067	B
yeah it was difficult for us to because uh	4067	B
well actually it it was all right as long as she could	4067	B
could get back and forth to the uh you know to the bathroom and	4067	B
things like that but when she got- when she got really sick and she couldn't move very much then it was exhausting absolutely exhausting	4067	B
you know so	4067	B
oh yeah	4067	B
yeah uh and that to that extent i think- like i say this health care for the elderly is	4067	B
is uh i- i think they do a lot there was one thing that that uh that helped pull my mom out of uh this	4067	B
oh i don't wanna know fog so to speak uh we had uh a a baby fairly late in life and uh as soon as that baby came along uh	4067	B
uh she paid a lot of attention to you know something to take care of i'll put it that way and something to pay attention to and and uh	4067	B
the other thing i've noticed is that that uh pets and and uh	4067	B
if they have pets to take care of uh like she got yeah she got uh	4067	B
music do you like	4092	A
um-hum	4092	A
um-hum	4092	A
i'm more into rock and roll myself	4092	A
um-hum	4092	A
um-hum	4092	A
um-hum	4092	A
do you like any bluegrass	4092	A
oh well at least your	4092	A
not really	4092	A
um	4092	A
we'll have to um	4092	A
i have a lot of friends that like country music	4092	A
no i'm more into um older rock like psychedelic- the psychedelic	4092	A
era like uh	4092	A
seventies- late sixties seventies um Greatful Dead Crosby Stills and Nash	4092	A
oh i've heard a little bit of it i've just-	4092	A
uh now i've heard of Striper	4092	A
it's like- the only one i can	4092	A
um-hum	4092	A
um-hum	4092	A
um i've heard some Amy Grant before she was you know became more mainstream top forty	4092	A
um-hum	4092	A
um	4092	A
i've never actually seen her in concert i imagine that she puts on a pretty good show	4092	A
um-hum	4092	A
um-hum	4092	A
um	4092	A
i like some country music uh it's just that i like finding a lot of it's	4092	A
yeah mama got run over by the train	4092	A
um-hum	4092	A
um-hum	4092	A
like Garth Brooks	4092	A
Reba McIntyre	4092	A
hm	4092	A
you don't like Patsy Cline	4092	A
you don't like Patsy Cline	4092	A
um yes actually i went to just went to just see the Greatful Dead about i guess about a week ago	4092	A
no they're still- they're still on tour they've been touring since late sixties	4092	A
no they're they're still together	4092	A
they're still making albums	4092	A
um-hum	4092	A
uh	4092	A
in fact i mean there are people that you know basically just follow them around from city to city on tour	4092	A
selling tie dyes and things like that	4092	A
um	4092	A
yeah they're	4092	A
they're like late forties early fifties but you know like whenever one of them dies off they get a replacement	4092	A
they seem to have you know they seem to have a really bad time with keyboard players they keep on dying and they keep on replacing them and the new ones in his thirties you know	4092	A
uh	4092	A
but uh	4092	A
yeah well they don't actually look as rough as the Rolling Stones i just i- i don't know if you saw the tour posters for the Rolling Stones when they last toured but i mean it looked like leather day at the geriatric	4092	A
all their faces were just all shriveled and	4092	A
um-hum	4092	A
i mean it just- just looked like you know they got a bunch of retirees and put them_1 in leather jackets and blue jeans	4092	A
well uh	4092	A
i prefer my my performers to be pretty sober you know just	4092	A
uh just so that you know that	4092	A
if they're jamming you know that they don't just lose themselves and you know go into la la land	4092	A
um-hum	4092	A
um-hum	4092	A
so um have you seen any concerts lately	4092	A
um lots of different kinds i guess um	4092	B
i like country music of course Texas and i listen to Christian music a lot because	4092	B
there's a Christian music station here in in our city so i listen to it quite a bit	4092	B
so	4092	B
um-hum and i listen because_1 on Friday nights they have the um	4092	B
they have what they call Saturday Night Live or they have it on Saturday night Friday night and Saturday night and they have Christian rock and roll	4092	B
so you know they have that type of music but they just have different words	4092	B
so i listen to that too	4092	B
no not really hum-um	4092	B
and i like i like rap music do you like rap music	4092	B
not really well i can tell we're we're together here okay	4092	B
oh	4092	B
what kind of rock	4092	B
what kind of rock music do you listen to do you listen- listen to like that really heavy metal stuff or	4092	B
seventies what the	4092	B
uh-huh	4092	B
yeah i have friends that like that	4092	B
yeah	4092	B
so you've never heard of like the Christian music that i listen to probably then	4092	B
like have you heard of um	4092	B
of Carmen	4092	B
have you ever heard of Kim	4092	B
Striper they're the really heavy yeah like the heavy metal stuff i guess	4092	B
yeah	4092	B
yeah because_1 she she plays both secular and Christian so	4092	B
yeah i like her too	4092	B
i have been to a concert a couple of times of hers and	4092	B
she does she's real good she's real good	4092	B
so i like her	4092	B
i don't like the country music that's like my wife left me my dog left me everybody's left me	4092	B
you know i like Randy Travis	4092	B
you know i like more of the real new ones	4092	B
you know Garth Brooks oh yes you know he's fine yeah i like them i don't care for the older you know like my dog left me stuff huh	4092	B
no huh-uh i don't even really know who she is you know you know so	4092	B
no	4092	B
but have you ever been to any of them concerts that you like that music that you like to	4092	B
but aren't they done with i thought that they	4092	B
and i just thought that they done broke up and	4092	B
left	4092	B
hm	4092	B
wow i didn't know that	4092	B
hm	4092	B
that's- interesting	4092	B
um-hum	4092	B
because_1 they're on up there in age aren't they	4092	B
okay all right	4092	B
oh all right	4092	B
because_1 they look pretty rough i mean i've seen like picture of them_1 and they just	4092	B
yeah i mean because_1 they just	4092	B
uh-huh yuck looking i mean ugh um	4092	B
um-hum well are you into that that	4092	B
rock music you know all that druggie stuff and all that i mean	4092	B
you know what i'm saying like i mean like they come on the stage and like you know you	4092	B
they're not even know they're there you know they're just so out of it	4092	B
yeah	4092	B
so i just- i just don't like you know	4092	B
that so	4092	B
i don't know	4092	B
hm huh	4092	B
um-hum	4088	B
well uh it- it- it it becomes sort of a a topic where i sit there and and i have a knee jerk reaction and then i have a a reaction after i think about it a little longer uh	4088	B
for me i i guess i feel like uh we have we- we- that we when we give in on these things we tend to move towards a	4088	B
a uh society where uh everything is a is uh regulated	4088	B
uh i think you're right about uh certain jobs and uh certainly something like uh a bus train pilots	4088	B
uh it's obviously something that's a necessity it because_1 it because_1 the function of the job is is within all everyone- pretty much everyone in the world	4088	B
uh would admit to the fact that that these drugs might impair their abilities	4088	B
okay	4088	B
and like so i guess in some ways i'm agreeing with you	4088	B
uh that those would be something that should continue to have uh drug testing of course it is certainly not acceptable for an Eastern pilot to	4088	B
uh have just had eight martinis before he went off to fly	4088	B
right	4088	B
um-hum	4088	B
i think it might be inappropriate for us to say for me to say that in any in any industry	4088	B
uh something where- where- see you're talking about a plant where okay if you're a nuclear inspector	4088	B
or where you're a uh person who works on safety features for nuclear inspection well that makes sense	4088	B
but uh we're talking about you- you know you're saying well uh and i think you uh that you just stated the same thing that if you were a clerical- you- you- you know a clerical person there or you were a secretary there now where's the justification	4088	B
what- what- what okay you know let's say that we can you- you- you- you had had a uh uh you went to a party and	4088	B
uh not not that anyone ever does it but you were smoking pot uh now how is that going to make any difference	4088	B
you know unless you very- unless you uh uh PCP does exist apparently in the blood stream	4088	B
for a long period of time but the ability for you to function seems to be	4088	B
uh very it it's very questionable as to whether it has any real effect upon you	4088	B
right	4088	B
so but- i I just went through one recently	4088	B
and uh the place i just transferred jobs not too long ago and so i went through the whole process and the	4088	B
there's really no justification what so ever for why i had to do it i mean uh	4088	B
it's a company that	4088	B
it's basically a oh	4088	B
management engineering company	4088	B
now	4088	B
what- wait but then but then uh but then if the if you're saying that	4088	B
uh	4088	B
they should also regulate- right what they should also regulate how many hours of sleep i must have they should also regulate how much what kind of nutrition i have they should also regulate- see it's a it's a it's a disturbing trend	4088	B
right	4088	B
um-hum	4088	B
okay well uh i guess since i called i'll start out with my feelings about it uh i think that it's absolutely essential that some some- at least some employees	4088	A
of government agencies and companies be tested especially when it effects public safety i mean the military obviously uh people that run trains and airplanes and and the like	4088	A
uh for others i don't know i don't feel as strong about it uh i don't really don't have any objection to it but i can't really say i'm for it either what's your feeling	4088	A
uh-huh	4088	A
yeah	4088	A
right or Northwest i think Northwest has had a lot of problems with that	4088	A
i uh i've been in uh two two situations where i've had to under go drug testing- drug testing i was in the military for a number of years	4088	A
and then i worked for four years uh as a as a an electrical inspector uh	4088	A
in a nuclear plant that was under construction and in both cases uh you know we were subject to uh to random testing for drugs	4088	A
and i know a lot of people refused to a lot especially at the nuclear plant or would uh you know strongly object to it but uh you know i could see the need for it so i i went along with it	4088	A
i i think if i were a clerical worker for instance though uh and really couldn't have effected anybody else i'm not sure that i'd	4088	A
um-hum	4088	A
um-hum	4088	A
uh-huh	4088	A
uh-huh	4088	A
right	4088	A
um	4088	A
um-hum	4088	A
uh-huh	4088	A
right	4088	A
right probably alcohol has more of an effect for for a shorter period of time	4088	A
uh-huh	4088	A
uh-huh	4088	A
uh-huh	4088	A
uh-huh	4088	A
um-hum so they were doing it just to they wanted to make sure that their employees were productive probably that's why-	4088	A
that's probably why they justified it	4088	A
no i'm just trying to imagine why they would wanna test you	4088	A
right	4088	A
right	4088	A
yeah i i think that people who do something that could hurt somebody else	4088	A
uh should be subject to the testing i guess that's probably the the way i'd term it and i'm talking about bus drivers as you mentioned and pilots and what have you	4088	A
uh others that really can only hurt themselves shall we say uh	4088	A
uh we still have an old uh Texas Instruments	4029	B
Professional Computer	4029	B
back in the days when TI was making uh computers that were similar to in terms of power to the IBM i don't remember what those were the ATs or something like that or	4029	B
way back when i don't know where to get any new software for it unfortunately so we just sort of stumble on using	4029	B
the same stuff that we always have	4029	B
um well i used to i have a Master's degree in computer science but i haven't i i took a time out on careers about	4029	B
six years ago when my first one turned a year old and	4029	B
so nowadays i'm teaching him at home and we're using the computer to drill him on math and to let him do some	4029	B
creative writing without having to have uh	4029	B
uh the mechanics of	4029	B
handwriting get in the way of his words this way he can	4029	B
he this way he just has to hunt and peck on the keyboard i have to admit i'd like a	4029	B
a more logical	4029	B
arrangement of the letters and uh	4029	B
what do they call it the Cortiope or something	4029	B
arrangement	4029	B
um	4029	B
we haven't for	4029	B
we ended up uh	4029	B
we're pretty involved with computers in all sorts of other aspects but um	4029	B
i guess i wanted something that was easier to use than this and that was more intuitive and so we just	4029	B
it just ended up not not getting used i should use it to balance my checkbook	4029	B
but then you have to remember to write it down	4029	B
or enter it	4029	B
oh my	4029	B
where do you find a place to work on a TI	4029	B
uh-huh	4029	B
well that's nice to know that there are still such people around	4029	B
yeah well i used to do that i'd used it um until	4029	B
as i say until i took a hiatus- hiatus from working i used to	4029	B
to uh	4029	B
trying to think of what you call it i- i used it essentially as a terminal then	4029	B
you know	4029	B
and	4029	B
so	4029	B
yeah	4029	B
well my kids think i should have games	4029	B
on top of games on top of games	4029	B
and of course we don't have any i keep telling them well you know just learn how to program	4029	B
write your own games yeah i just	4029	B
oh	4029	B
yeah	4029	B
oh really	4029	B
uh	4029	B
no who would do something like that	4029	B
but uh	4029	B
yeah we have basically we use the WordStar on it	4029	B
you know for a bunch of	4029	B
i'm taking a class now and	4029	B
um i'm actually getting a degree in nursing at this point and i asked the	4029	B
and the class i'm taking now all of a sudden they want everything typed till now everything's been handwritten so it was a good thing that the computer was back up and running hooked the printer up to it	4029	B
right right well i couldn't figure out how to it's been a while since i've gotten it going all right so i tried to hook the printer up and i was sure i put all the	4029	B
connectors in right and everything and had checked to make sure the pins were all facing the right way and i couldn't get the computer to recognize that there was a printer there to save my life and so i was like oh this thing doesn't work and we've lost the	4029	B
you know we've lost the install software documentation what am i supposed to do so my husband took it in to work-	4029	B
well- Nancy what kind of a personal computer do you have	4029	A
something like that yeah i have one of those too	4029	A
yeah do you use computers at work or	4029	A
uh-huh	4029	A
so do i	4029	A
i see	4029	A
yeah	4029	A
something like that	4029	A
oh	4029	A
do you use your computer for other things balancing checkbooks do you keep budgets and that sort of thing in it or	4029	A
that's right that's right	4029	A
well mine mine kind of died so it's being worked on right now	4029	A
i found a technician who works at TI	4029	A
and does things like that in his spare time	4029	A
oh yeah	4029	A
yeah	4029	A
but i most of the stuff i've used that computer for were work related just bringing work home	4029	A
yeah	4029	A
yeah i've done a lot of that	4029	A
and i suspect most people do uh use them as terminals or	4029	A
have a spreadsheet and a word processor and that's about it	4029	A
what else do you need right	4029	A
well that's probably true	4029	A
yeah write your own games right	4029	A
the computer i work have at work came with uh Windows software and it has a couple of games on it one of which is a solitaire just	4029	A
just standard card solitaire	4029	A
but the graphics are so incredible and you can choose what you want the deck of cards to look like you know you can have flowers on the back of them or fishes or oh yes or a robot who has a little gauge that moves in his tummy and	4029	A
i just- i just happened to stumble across that of course i don't play games at work right	4029	A
uh-huh	4029	A
that's right	4029	A
i was going to say you must have a printer then	4029	A
uh-huh	4029	A
i feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently uh	4064	B
in that it seems to me they're swayed more by emotion than uh by evidence that's presented	4064	B
i have uh very little regard for the law	4064	B
that's presently practiced	4064	B
i was thinking primarily criminal cases	4064	B
yes	4064	B
um-hum that's a concern of mine uh	4064	B
i would feel more comfortable in many cases i think with judges uh you know doing the sentencing	4064	B
um-hum	4064	B
yeah my question i guess is are they really your peers	4064	B
uh	4064	B
uh too often i think they're not and uh when you you- when you are	4064	B
selecting a jury and you're doing it partially if if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have	4064	B
you know that's a matter of concern to me too uh i think that uh in such cases uh	4064	B
they're not really looking for unbiased people but rather for biased	4064	B
uh now i happen to know several judges and there's one that i'd feel uncomfortable but has doing sentencing without the jury	4064	B
i'd feel a little bit uneasy about but the other two i feel uh would give either	4064	B
you know the the plaintiff or the defendant uh the the- the full benefit of the law	4064	B
and i guess that's what i am concerned with	4064	B
um-hum	4064	B
this is very true	4064	B
um-hum um-hum	4064	B
yeah and you do see such uneven- uneven sentencing uh you know evidence of it in the newspapers and such i mean	4064	B
where uh it would appear that the crimes were very similar but one individual got twenty five years and the other one was sentenced to life for something-	4064	B
uh	4064	B
isn't that the truth	4064	B
there are times when is it uh	4064	B
oh goodness my mind's gone blank it uh Othello	4064	B
you know where he says kill all the lawyers every now and then one is tempted to feel that way	4064	B
but i it's taken me a long time to understand that uh lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice as we think of	4064	B
you know amateur- as novices tend to think that uh attorneys care about justice	4064	B
um-hum	4064	B
and they're very effective too uh even i've been involved slightly- slightly in a case where i know the person is guilty but uh his attorneys gotten him off	4064	B
uh the city has dropped their charges against him because their the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge	4064	B
so i don't know	4064	B
well how do you feel about trial by jury	4064	A
in what way	4064	A
i mean do you do you feel they're they're swayed more toward- are you talking about with criminal or civil suits	4064	A
um-hum so you think that i mean that the stereotypical bleeding heart juries where they feel sorry	4064	A
um-hum	4064	A
the other thing the other thing that really bothers me about that is i think you know that a judge can be	4064	A
uh i like the idea of juries uh of your peers um in that	4064	A
you you you you you get more first of all you get more than one person making the decision- making a decision and second of all you get a wide variety of background so that	4064	A
um-hum	4064	A
i'd agree that that's that's definitely a problem	4064	A
um-hum	4064	A
um-hum	4064	A
um-hum	4064	A
um-hum	4064	A
um-hum	4064	A
yeah i	4064	A
i guess i- i- definitely agree with you but sentencing- the well what i don't like about uh sentencing- juries doing the sentencing in that	4064	A
i think it becomes a lot less the- the- the the same crime gets unequal sentences	4064	A
i uh i- i think there is more of an ability of you know you know selecting- selecting- selecting a jury two two different juries that would	4064	A
most of the time come up with the same idea the same idea versus you know whether he is guilty or innocent	4064	A
but	4064	A
i think i think that there'd that there'd be a large variation in	4064	A
in trying to	4064	A
gauge the the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and and have that	4064	A
that measure stick across the board	4064	A
um-hum	4064	A
um-hum	4064	A
um-hum	4064	A
of course a lot of that's also the the ability of of the defendant to uh get a good lawyer	4064	A
um-hum	4064	A
um-hum	4064	A
yeah i agree	4064	A
um-hum	4064	A
um-hum	4064	A
oh yeah i- i agree with it yeah they and they'll admit to you that they cannot- they don't have the benefit of being able to you know of of of letting allowing themselves to believe their client- client innocent or guilty it's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury	4064	A
through argument that the	4064	A
um-hum	4064	A
um-hum	4064	A
um-hum	4064	A
yeah	4064	A
uh	4064	A
yeah this is a little bit of the subject but one one thing that i that i really dislike uh also that's that's new is the uh is that i have heard that there are federal sentences	4064	A
um-hum	4097	A
does he he live at home now and	4097	A
um-hum yeah	4097	A
no i i know my uh my mother uh my grandmother is still alive and uh feisty old old lady she's uh she's really pretty good but but she really just can't get around any more and she does have significant- significant health problems	4097	A
and my mom is looking after after her and it it's a big drain on my mom i can tell when i when i get calls from her she she sounds worn out	4097	A
uh and uh it's tough on on my grandmother because she's use to just	4097	A
going to the store and getting what she wants and baking up things for her friends but now she's no longer where she grew up her friends have all passed on or in another city she can't just run right out and get things so a lot of these thing	4097	A
fall on my mom go to the store get me this i want to go do that uh i've changed my mind phone calls in the middle of the night because she's lonesome yeah	4097	A
yeah and uh you know i i can see from a distance i'm not right there on top of it maybe i am a little bit more objective but	4097	A
i would think that they would try like to try and find her some place that first of all she could be happy	4097	A
yeah	4097	A
yeah	4097	A
um	4097	A
yeah	4097	A
you almost like to have some place that's almost hospice care but a little bit more independent than that almost almost like a community that has partly something like condominiums	4097	A
where those people that are mobile can still retain their their independence	4097	A
but maybe have somebody come by and check on them once or twice a day bring them the groceries or come by and chat or whatever and then a hospice for those who no longer quite so mobile	4097	A
the problem with everything else in health care is is the cost	4097	A
uh i mean that's that's almost why some of the you know the the experimental cooperatives you hear about where people sort of throw in all their money together and and do that sort of thing but it's it's	4097	A
you you start getting commercialization of it and the cost just skyrockets	4097	A
so they want to really make a a a a method of it i wish that we could find some place for for my grandmother she'd be happier	4097	A
uh and my mother wouldn't have to drop everything and and really she's lost a great deal of control of her life to the point where her own health is deteriorating	4097	A
and and that the stress is just enormous i i feel for you you're you're one step closer than i am to it and it must be it must be really draining on you	4097	A
oh	4097	A
um-hum yeah	4097	A
oh it it right now though he's independent enough to to take care of day to day or or have-	4097	A
oh	4097	A
oh yeah	4097	A
oh	4097	A
yeah yeah i can i can appreciate that and there's there- there use to be programs in some of the more progressive communities of of of house mates	4097	A
somebody that comes and lives there and for the room and board takes care of people but	4097	A
you need you need a contact service in the community i'd i'd even be happy just	4097	A
uh trying to find a a day program that my grandmother would be willing to accept that she could go and spend the day meeting some- right now she tries to hold up in her apartment and the only people she	4097	A
uh no this elderly care of the elderly i am looking at this right now with my father	4097	B
and it is a tough decision to make	4097	B
that uh	4097	B
yes and he's living at home more or less alone my sister spends an awful low of time with with him which is a burden on her	4097	B
and his health is so bad that we don't feel right about you know just letting him do what he wants to do	4097	B
and of course he feels like he is capable of taking care of himself and we know better	4097	B
uh-huh	4097	B
uh-huh	4097	B
yeah	4097	B
uh-huh	4097	B
oh yeah Yeah	4097	B
well that's that will be a problem because i have looked and they all really amount to the same thing uh	4097	B
i've looked for all both ends of the scale really from your kind of State run things to the very private elite type and it really	4097	B
boils down i think to one thing you're putting somebody in there and more or less waiting for them to die	4097	B
and it's uh it's sad but that's the way we've been brought up to look at it	4097	B
and i hate it but there comes a time when when this is what what happens	4097	B
especially with the way medicine is today It's keeping us alive longer and	4097	B
we're living longer so therefore you know	4097	B
right	4097	B
yeah it's kind of our	4097	B
right	4097	B
uh-huh	4097	B
the cost is just unreal	4097	B
right well that's	4097	B
uh-huh	4097	B
right right	4097	B
well it is especially since he lives in Mississippi i live in Texas and my sister lives in Louisiana This this you know it makes fact i just got back from having to go stay with him because she needed to get away	4097	B
and it's uh	4097	B
but uh i don't know what other solution there is eventually we're going to have to put him in a home some place	4097	B
well more or less but he is almost to the point that he's legally blind so that really is what bothers us uh he could start a fire just about anything could happen	4097	B
uh-huh	4097	B
right	4097	B
right	4097	B
it's Clinton right	4021	B
Clint okay	4021	B
as in Clint Black right	4021	B
um i'm pretty serious it's a serious hobby i guess	4021	B
um i'd like more but yeah i'm getting up there i just have a used table saw right now i'm looking at getting a better one but it's just an old Sears Craftsman	4021	B
uh mostly fine woodworking furniture type stuff um enjoy the children's toys	4021	B
i like making those	4021	B
so it's basically smaller stuff	4021	B
have you done much big stuff	4021	B
right	4021	B
you do kitchen cabinets and stuff	4021	B
uh-huh	4021	B
finish finish carpentry or	4021	B
uh-huh	4021	B
no	4021	B
yeah i got a i just finished a project one of those um swinging cradles	4021	B
and i turned all the spindles for that and that took a long time but it was pretty fun	4021	B
yeah oak	4021	B
that's really hard to turn	4021	B
but	4021	B
yeah	4021	B
had to fill a lot of chip marks up but	4021	B
it really chips really easy	4021	B
do you work with oak much	4021	B
not at all	4021	B
uh-huh	4021	B
yeah that's i tried it for a job once and	4021	B
it's just not for me i like it as a hobby more	4021	B
doing small stuff on the side	4021	B
yeah yeah once in a while i'll sell some um custom custom type wood work if they're willing to pay the price now	4021	B
i used to get ripped off all the time because i spent way too much time on them	4021	B
um i'm starting to i used that's what i did for a job one summer i made some cabinets for a junior high school and but i haven't done a lot of them	4021	B
i use oak face frames and then just plywood for the box	4021	B
the yeah the just on the outside where it shows yeah just slip it into a groove that you make on the face frame	4021	B
and then you can just slip that in there it's a lot cheaper of course quarter inch and three quarter inch aren't much cheaper than each other	4021	B
of plywood	4021	B
but	4021	B
yeah just a	4021	B
for to the plywood yeah i just finish sand it just like with one fifty	4021	B
and then you can finish it up	4021	B
so	4021	B
um just the garage i wish i had a workshop but the stuff i do i- i don't need a lot of room for it	4021	B
uh she puts up with me buying the tools she likes wood she likes me wood working but	4021	B
getting the equipment i want sure is taken a lot of years i started when i was about sixteen buying my own equipment	4021	B
and i only need a few more things like a joiner i'd like to have and small some smaller things	4021	B
oh man everytime we	4021	B
yeah i just bought a a sprayer to finish my project um a high volume low pressure sprayer	4021	B
it's a high volume low pressure they're new sprayers that are coming out	4021	B
really little over spray	4021	B
it's air it only sprays with three PSI	4021	B
but uh the cubic feet per minute of air flow is up to ninety and so that's what	4021	B
that's what gives you your thrust of your paint	4021	B
um do you do	4021	B
it was five hundred bucks	4021	B
okay uh	4021	A
yeah it's Clint uh-huh	4021	A
right is it a hobby for you or do you get serious about it	4021	A
do you have a lot of nice tools table saws things like like that	4021	A
do you do any remodeling of your house or what kind of woodworking do you enjoy	4021	A
hum	4021	A
yeah	4021	A
the the big stuff's what i do the the stuff you do is the the work um working with hardwoods and and stuff like that is i i'm lousy at that i mess it up every time	4021	A
no no no even that that's that's i still mess up when i um i guess i really don't do much actual wood working uh	4021	A
i do a lot of carpentry stuff um uh finishing basements and rooms and things of that nature but it's	4021	A
i- i do do a little bit of finish carpentry but not very much i don't not very much not not like the stuff that you're doing	4021	A
um when i took shop classes in high school it was a lot of fun using the lathe and doing some fancy stuff with that course you can't mess things up on the lathe hardly	4021	A
but uh	4021	A
uh-huh	4021	A
i'll bet	4021	A
was it hard woods you were using in it	4021	A
uh-huh	4021	A
uh-huh	4021	A
and make it look nice it is	4021	A
uh-huh	4021	A
uh not at all not at all no pine and redwood and like i say i'm i'm really not a uh carpenter per se i'm a	4021	A
or a wood worker i'm a carpenter i guess is and i'm really not even a carpenter i just but i enjoy it i do a lot of it	4021	A
it it's tough- uh tough to make a living isn't it	4021	A
do you sell any so you do do some sales when you	4021	A
um do you do cabinets too	4021	A
uh-huh	4021	A
is it hard wood when you use when you what kind of hard wood do you use	4021	A
that plywood that's got the oak uh do you use that a lot where it's just you know what maybe a quarter inch or even thinner than that possibly piece of oak that's on the outside do you use that a lot	4021	A
uh-huh	4021	A
um-hum	4021	A
uh-huh	4021	A
and then they just have an oak face on them	4021	A
are they ready to uh	4021	A
i guess finish or do you have to do anything	4021	A
yeah	4021	A
um-hum	4021	A
do you have a workshop or are you using the garage or	4021	A
and your wife puts up with that	4021	A
uh-huh huh	4021	A
um	4021	A
expensive you can get a lot of money in that kind of stuff especially the good stuff	4021	A
air- uh air- uh air pressure	4021	A
huh	4021	A
is- is- is it electric or air	4021	A
um	4021	A
um	4021	A
how much- how much does that cost you	4021	A
is that right gee and that was just for the gun that wasn't for the compressor anything-	4021	A
okay um well why don't you go ahead and start because you have more experience it sounds like	4007	A
um-hum	4007	A
um-hum	4007	A
oh	4007	A
oh goodness	4007	A
uh-huh	4007	A
oh goodness	4007	A
so do they know what they're saying though do they seem to know the words that they're saying	4007	A
because_1 they're they're real young	4007	A
yeah because_1 that could be a blessing further down the road but it can also be a problem now	4007	A
uh-huh	4007	A
oh	4007	A
uh-huh	4007	A
oh goodness	4007	A
hm	4007	A
um-hum	4007	A
um-hum	4007	A
yeah yeah they'll be because_1 at this age they're real real young and they could pick up any kind of language it it's amazing how easy they can learn	4007	A
well i've uh i got two children as well my oldest is eight and my youngest is four and i used to teach and when my first one was born i was lucky enough to be able to choose whether i wanted to work or not and	4007	A
even though i had just gotten my Master's degree i chose to stay home just because i worried a lot about child care and really wanted to be able to be that person that raised my children and	4007	A
i like you're feeling the frustration of what they're picking up on that's exactly the worries that i had is that i worried about what kind of things they might be exposed to or pick up on and i was just really	4007	A
paranoid and i guess just decided to be my own child's caregiver and at times i've regretted it just because_1 i miss working with adults and uh	4007	A
you know speaking regular language more than the the children's you know kind of language	4007	A
right right and as a cartoon once said i would like to have dinner with someone who can cut their own meat and that kind of thing um	4007	A
but now i'm getting up at the at the stage where i will need to go back to work and so i'm looking at this issue and my four year old is just at the point where she'll be starting kindergarten next year which is still only half day so we'll still have to look at that kind of	4007	A
of set up for her so	4007	A
um-hum	4007	A
um-hum	4007	A
oh	4007	A
uh-huh	4007	A
um-hum	4007	A
oh are you so am i yeah what part oh okay i was in the Phoenix uh Mesa area	4007	A
um-hum	4007	A
oh yeah because_1 now you're depending on other people that you don't know	4007	A
uh-huh	4007	A
yeah yeah	4007	A
yeah	4007	A
that's right yeah	4007	A
and even if you have someone there right at your own house doing that kind of day care you still always have that little worry i'm sure	4007	A
so	4007	A
that's that is a problem what kind of criteria do you look for when you are shopping around	4007	A
uh-huh	4007	A
well i've got two kids one of them_1's a year old and one of them_1's going on three	4007	B
and in California anyways where i'm located my husband's in the Navy it's really hard to find child care around here because most people that are around here	4007	B
they're either Mexican or Filipino and they don't speak English	4007	B
so it's like my kids pick up really funny words	4007	B
and they come home and say something to me and i don't understand what they're saying	4007	B
and it's like i mean day care is really expensive it costs like three hundred dollars	4007	B
for day care for two kids for a month and when they come home i don't even understand half the stuff they're saying	4007	B
um	4007	B
sometimes	4007	B
yeah	4007	B
like one day he came home and said something and i asked him what he was saying i told him to point to it so i could understand what he was saying and he was talking about the cartoon you know Peter Pan	4007	B
but he said it you know in i- i don't even remember- i don't i don't even know which one it was it was either Spanish or Filipino i'm not even sure which language it was	4007	B
but he knew it was Peter Pan it's just he didn't say Peter Pan	4007	B
and so it's kind of hard to understand what they're saying	4007	B
but i don't wanna tell him not to say it because there's nothing wrong with it	4007	B
it's just makes it hard to understand	4007	B
yeah	4007	B
yeah	4007	B
yeah and actually having conversations instead of one line sentences	4007	B
really	4007	B
yeah my husband and i made a deal when our second son was born because we had i had to work	4007	B
there was after our second son was born there wasn't any choice i had to work	4007	B
so we made a deal he's in the Navy and six months out of the year he's gone on a ship	4007	B
so for those six months i don't work i stay home with the kids	4007	B
but while he's in dock and he's you know on shore duty for six months then i work in the daytime	4007	B
and we have child care for them it's only six months out of the year but still it	4007	B
it's just it's kind of weird because the quality of day care is different than what i'm used to because i'm i'm originally from Arizona yeah really	4007	B
Mayer	4007	B
yeah a little tiny dinky town up by Prescott	4007	B
but um it's really strange because	4007	B
i'm used to just going to my next door neighbor and she babysat me and you know when i first had when we first had our first son she babysat him until we moved and	4007	B
it's really different here	4007	B
yeah {moneywise} and you don't know them_1 and you're worried you know	4007	B
i mean i know a lot of people say well it never happens to you it just happens to other people when children disappear but it's still scary when you have to look for day care	4007	B
you know you always have that fear	4007	B
i got to find somebody really- you know really that i can depend on	4007	B
yeah	4007	B
well i have a notebook and in it i have the top thirty questions and that may sound kind of strange but	4007	B
it's i'm just kind of paranoid as a mother it's like i want my child safe	4007	B
so uh	4068	A
do- do you know what the laws of Texas are in regard to capital punishment	4068	A
i'm sorry would you repeat that please	4068	A
i'm sorry you you're just a little just a little quiet i just couldn't quite hear what you said	4068	A
uh-huh	4068	A
uh-huh	4068	A
yeah and he i i'm uh	4068	A
i believe in California it is permitted but for a few years they were	4068	A
not doing it i don't think i don't think there's been an execution for a while uh but i'm a little ignorant of it myself i know that there was a	4068	A
there was a state supreme court justice who was uh being pounded on in the newspapers because she was overturning	4068	A
uh convictions or she was somehow keeping death penalties from being carried out and uh the newspapers were	4068	A
giving her a very hard time on that although i always suspected it was something else and that was just something to bang on her about	4068	A
well i	4068	A
i don't to me it seems unnecessary	4068	A
um	4068	A
i think that the sort of person who	4068	A
would be deterred	4068	A
by capital punishment would also be deterred by life in prison	4068	A
um	4068	A
and uh	4068	A
it seems just with the possibility of	4068	A
making mistakes that uh	4068	A
i would rather opt for life in prison where at least there's a chance the person could uh either change or perhaps even	4068	A
you know contribute to society from prison in some way	4068	A
well what do you feeling	4068	A
um-hum	4068	A
right it's uh	4068	A
do you think it would be a deterrent	4068	A
well that is true that is true um	4068	A
uh-huh	4068	A
oh i see you're thinking that if the laws were enforced in general people would be	4068	A
maybe people would be stopped at doing something before they got to the point of	4068	A
of killing somebody	4068	A
um	4068	A
well you know i mean i think i think i'm in agreement with you on this point that hey there's a problem and	4068	A
the solution to the problem isn't whether you kill people or not at the end it's what happens before that uh and i would say that uh	4068	A
you know putting more	4068	A
giving more attention to uh child rearing	4068	A
you know as early as that is- is it the terms of giving kids a good education and uh	4068	A
sort of a good uh	4068	A
i don't know moral or self esteem sort of backing that would keep them from getting into that sort of life in the first place	4068	A
could make it less necessary also	4068	A
yeah and that's i it seems like people uh	4068	A
focus more on the one end of the system where you're executing someone or not rather than the other end of the system where you're turning out a person who's likely to do something like that or not	4068	A
uh	4068	A
so i think that sort of goes along with what you're saying	4068	A
uh	4068	A
are there certain you know i mean are there certain crimes or do you think there are or should be certain crimes that are liable for it and others not i mean clearly there are but which ones do you think should be liable	4068	A
um-hum	4068	A
um-hum	4068	A
um-hum	4068	A
um-hum	4068	A
um-hum	4068	A
um-hum	4068	A
um-hum	4068	A
um i have to plead ignorant i really don't know i- i think that that uh i think Texas is for it i don't think we've had any instances of it	4068	B
pardon	4068	B
oh okay	4068	B
sorry i said Texas is is for capital punishment um-hum i don't think we've had a case uh recently but but it is	4068	B
um-hum	4068	B
um-hum	4068	B
um-hum	4068	B
yeah could be could be how do you feel about about the capital punishment	4068	B
um-hum	4068	B
well uh i probably tend to fall- come down on the side of of being for it but i- i think it	4068	B
it- it shouldn't be um there should be more safe guards to be sure that that you're you know no mistakes have been made	4068	B
but then i- i tend to i tend to come down on the side that if if the laws were were enforced that were on the books you probably wouldn't need it	4068	B
well obviously that person wouldn't do it again	4068	B
and it but but i think that like i said if- if the laws that are already on on the books that exist were enforced to the letter of the law	4068	B
then i think that in itself would cut down on all kinds of crime	4068	B
um-hum	4068	B
right because i- i think too many too many of them_1 walk you know	4068	B
um-hum	4068	B
well that's true you've got to have the foundation there	4068	B
um well i think murder is number one	4068	B
uh	4068	B
i- i- i- i	4068	B
tend to believe in an eye for an eye if you if you take a life then you need to lose yours you know not not that you can bring the other person back and and obviously can't	4068	B
but i see no reason	4068	B
to	4068	B
for you to continue you know and and possibly get out and do it again you know there's too much of	4068	B
if you could put them_1 away and be assured that they would stay there you know where they couldn't hurt anybody else that'd be one thing but	4068	B
most of of the uh	4068	B
murderers that go to jail get	4068	B
really	4076	B
uh-huh	4076	B
uh-huh	4076	B
right	4076	B
uh-huh	4076	B
right	4076	B
so when you did it does the jury actually uh determine- determine the sentence	4076	B
uh-huh	4076	B
uh-huh	4076	B
uh-huh	4076	B
uh-huh	4076	B
uh-huh	4076	B
well it seems like the the whole process i don't know a whole lot about it but one thing that i would think is is when the attorneys actually go through the selection of the jury process	4076	B
seems to me that that would that kind of biases- i mean they have control over well we want this person and we don't want this person here and it seems like that could kind of bias the case toward you know their client	4076	B
right	4076	B
right	4076	B
right which	4076	B
an equal balance	4076	B
yeah i really do also i mean the forefathers whoever- whoever came up with the idea surely- they were surely thinking a lot harder than i can think	4076	B
but uh it just it seems to work pretty well in most cases then some cases like the Manuel Noriega trial i don't see how they could have found anybody in the country who didn't have some opinion on that case	4076	B
yeah it is that's that's one of the things that's the reason why they will often change venues of court and stuff like that to get a jury which doesn't have any any uh bias towards the case	4076	B
and it it uh it just seems like sometimes the people that they're going to end up with have got to be just your basic you know schmucks	4076	B
yeah it's- to not know anything about you know or not have formed any type of opinion about some of these large major cases that we've been having lately	4076	B
it just seems like those- i guess that's the one thing that i would think is wrong with it i don't know what you'd about it but those people are are not going to be i mean if they haven't formed some sort of opinion i don't uh i don't know what i'm trying to say really but it just	4076	B
that's right because-	4076	B
because having not formed an opinion to me says something about the people themselves well either they sit in a little hole you know for all their life and don't hear about anything going on in the world and i don't see how somebody like that is going to be a very good uh	4076	B
i don't know- form- form be able to form a very coherent opinion about	4076	B
so	4076	B
uh-huh	4076	B
right	4076	B
uh-huh	4076	B
right	4076	B
uh-huh	4076	B
right and as far as the i don't think that the uh sentencing should be left up to the judge because that just that would- that gives too much power to any one person	4076	B
right	4076	B
yeah that just i mean for for one person i'm sure- sure they have studied the law and have- been involved in it for so long but still i think it's this is suppose to be a system of government by the people even though that's kind of a joke	4076	B
but it still seems that the people ought to be the ones the crime was against society it ought to be society as a whole you know that- uh as represented by the jury	4076	B
so uh have you personally been involved in any trial by jury	4076	A
uh	4076	A
uh-huh	4076	A
yeah i was called uh once and i actually sat on a jury and it took a few weeks	4076	A
the case was suppose to the judge predicted it would take a few days	4076	A
and it just stretched out and stretched out and uh it was kind of interesting	4076	A
to uh in a in a in a way that kind of satisfied my uh or that pandered to my nosiness	4076	A
-because- it was a civil case and you got to hear every little detail about how these guys had dealt with each other	4076	A
and uh you were invited to you know pass judgement on them	4076	A
well in this case we determined the award	4076	A
um it was two fellows a bunch of money had had uh passed from one to the other and we had to decide uh	4076	A
was it -was it wages was it a loan that needed to be paid back	4076	A
uh was it you know what was it and if it was something if if anybody owed anybody any money back how much did they owe	4076	A
and not only how much was	4076	A
how much did they owe but on top of that did we want to penalize them_1	4076	A
uh	4076	A
um-hum	4076	A
uh-huh	4076	A
well that's certainly what they're trying to do right	4076	A
uh at least there are two of them	4076	A
uh knocking off	4076	A
i guess i guess all they can do is knock off the people they think would be most biased against them	4076	A
so maybe maybe by knocking off extreme cases on both sides you end up with	4076	A
maybe	4076	A
it could be it could be worse i- i find it hard to think of something better	4076	A
yeah that seems like uh it seems like you'd have to ignore- either ignore that i mean is it a requirement that you don't already have an opinion	4076	A
uh-huh	4076	A
uh-huh	4076	A
they got to have a problem	4076	A
yeah yeah	4076	A
yeah it would almost be as if if it if they could somehow say hey having an opinion's okay it's being willing to change it that's important thing	4076	A
uh-huh	4076	A
right i mean you want people who are	4076	A
engaged	4076	A
uh-huh	4076	A
uh well that- that was one nice thing about the civil case	4076	A
is that it it was nothing that	4076	A
had shown up in the papers you know it was just two guys the	4076	A
what they the only thing they looked for was if you had been in a similar situation yourself	4076	A
and i guess they figured you	4076	A
you know	4076	A
you would be biased in favor of which ever party you identified with	4076	A
it does seem like the judge has a lot of power in the first place and why give him this part also	4076	A
uh-huh	4076	A
yes i do uh i like to uh play basketball and weight lifting those are probably the two main things i like to do	4032	B
yeah	4032	B
um in in in the winter you typically it's it's probably too cold to go out and do things like tennis um i like to play tennis in the summer time or in the spring fall	4032	B
but in the winter it it's gets pretty cold	4032	B
um yeah so it's mostly indoor sports i think in the winter	4032	B
um	4032	B
how about_1 yourself	4032	B
uh-huh	4032	B
um-hum	4032	B
right do you uh do any anaerobic type weight lifting or weight training type exercise	4032	B
um-hum	4032	B
huh	4032	B
yes it's it's it's aerobics- it's similar to aerobics with weights	4032	B
but it's like low impact aerobics where you use weights	4032	B
okay are you familiar with um step or bench aerobics	4032	B
uh yes i have in in Atlanta that's um most of the health clubs	4032	B
are all that's the that's the in thing	4032	B
at first it was just regular aerobics but now bench or step aerobics have kind of taken over	4032	B
um it they call it a low impact aerobics	4032	B
and it's supposed to burn off more calories at the same time	4032	B
and from when i've done it it does give you a good	4032	B
a real good workout	4032	B
but the only thing i'm concerned about is potential for injury to your knees	4032	B
you know that and movement of going up on the step	4032	B
you know that could create a problem	4032	B
they they seem to think that it it won't but you never know	4032	B
yeah i i think	4032	B
my ankles probably are my lame weak point but	4032	B
i've i've kind of taken care of that i wear high tops and then also an an a support ankle brace which is very stiff	4032	B
and um wearing- wearing that i haven't had any problems in the past year or so	4032	B
yeah	4032	B
yeah i	4032	B
um-hum	4032	B
yeah i did i injured mine so many times that rehabilitating became quite easy	4032	B
i mean	4032	B
it would only take three or four days and i could play again on it	4032	B
because after a while you just learn how to to rehabilitate yourself to play that way	4032	B
but um so how how successful is your exercise video	4032	B
uh-huh	4032	B
um	4032	B
um-hum	4032	B
um-hum	4032	B
so it's a good workout	4032	B
um-hum	4032	B
so in the winter i guess there's a lot uh it's quite cold and and snow	4032	B
okay Martin do you do any exercise	4032	A
uh-huh	4032	A
um	4032	A
so those are more or less indoor sports how's the weather out there in Georgia	4032	A
uh-huh	4032	A
oh	4032	A
uh-huh	4032	A
well yeah i'm on a exercise program i'm riding my Aerodyne bike um half an hour every morning and i'm just about ready to	4032	A
up it to forty five minutes a morning and i feel like that's been a real nice exercise in the winter time	4032	A
it's it's kind of kept me from getting cabin fever and um has seemed to be a real nice aerobic exercise	4032	A
no huh-uh i first of all i'd like to get my weight off i'm about fifty pounds overweight and so i'd like to get the weight off and then i'd really like to get into that	4032	A
and uh we have a my husband and i have a a aerobic video that's called The Firm i don't know if you've heard of it but it's a an aerobic video with	4032	A
not necessarily bouncing around and jumping up and down but you're using weights and that is the most incredible aerobic workout i have ever done it is really- it's really fun	4032	A
yes uh-huh	4032	A
uh-huh yes	4032	A
um no i mean yes i am but i have never done it myself have you done that	4032	A
oh	4032	A
that's the big thing huh	4032	A
oh	4032	A
so how is that	4032	A
ooh	4032	A
oh	4032	A
uh-huh	4032	A
yeah	4032	A
huh	4032	A
now if um playing basketball are you knees do you have healthy knees	4032	A
oh dear	4032	A
uh-huh	4032	A
um-hum that's good well that sounds you sound just like my husband he he he injured his ankle about seven months ago playing volleyball and	4032	A
oh he's just had a heck of a time getting that ankle healthy and- so that's what he does he wears his	4032	A
his brace and his high tops and	4032	A
oh	4032	A
uh oh shoot	4032	A
wow	4032	A
uh-huh	4032	A
oh dear oh	4032	A
it is amazing how fast you take off the inches	4032	A
and i would once i start my forty i'd like to do the forty five minutes a day on the bike for a week and then every other day i'd like to incorporate the video	4032	A
um and then the bike on the other day	4032	A
but it is really amazing how fast the inches come off and the muscle builds	4032	A
real fast um you can start they recommend doing the video without weights	4032	A
for the first month and then after that you can just start with your five pound dumbbells and then build up to your uh twenty five pound dumbbells	4032	A
and then you're just doing repetitious exercises throughout the whole video and it's a hour long video	4032	A
so	4032	A
it is yeah i really enjoy that so i'm looking forward to	4032	A
losing this weight and being firm and healthy	4032	A
yes	4032	A
yes now this one has been quite mild um	4032	A
we could have been out walking throughout the whole winter because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground	4032	A
it was quite chilly but not	4032	A
no i haven't either but a lot of my friends and actually my boss had to put his mother in a nursing home and i know just going through it with him i mean it's a real traumatic experience	4041	B
first just even deciding to do it and then i think feeling guilty after you know that it needs to be done you know	4041	B
oh really	4041	B
um-hum	4041	B
okay that's what i was just going to say if they're out of state you know it's different if they're in the same town i think you have a little more chance to look out for them_1 but	4041	B
then too if you work you know you get there has to be somebody there	4041	B
um-hum	4041	B
uh-huh	4041	B
oh oh you mean not staying at home -you mean and not yeah yeah	4041	B
um-hum	4041	B
no yeah well that's just it because i mean jeez they've got probably- probably good twenty years to live you know some- some cases if they're healthy you know	4041	B
it would be clean yeah	4041	B
i know and to make sure that there's enough people there to keep everybody like that can you know to be involved instead of just leaving them sit in their rooms you know	4041	B
um-hum	4041	B
yeah	4041	B
in fact i used to date a guy that reminds me when i was back in Minneapolis but his mother i mean he had she ended up i guess getting it Alzheimer's- what they now call Alzheimer's yeah	4041	B
but to begin with you know when they first i mean she would know us you know and we'd go to visit her but then	4041	B
it would get you know like she didn't really know she didn't know me and then she thought he was a brother you know and it just got steadily worse you know	4041	B
um-hum	4041	B
and has been independent all their lives and then all of a sudden you know	4041	B
um	4041	B
um-hum	4041	B
um	4041	B
just getting used to it	4041	B
oh	4041	B
uh-huh	4041	B
oh	4041	B
uh-huh	4041	B
well that yeah would definitely be a positive part because_1 they'd be around more people and would be easier for them to get out and to see those people i guess	4041	B
well i would think that you ought to be in fact i was going to say that i would go at different times of the day not only when they're expecting you to come	4041	B
you know just to see how you know at different times of the day what they do and how they treat them you know	4041	B
um-hum	4041	B
or is it just because yeah they're having such a hard time adjusting you know	4041	B
um-hum	4041	B
i haven't had to put anyone in a nursing home but we came close have you had that experience yet	4041	A
um-hum	4041	A
that's for sure yeah	4041	A
um-hum um-hum uh yeah i had a a good friend who just did it and and my boss too	4041	A
yeah and uh and uh well both his parents were sick- not doing well went to take care of one and then one of them died and then it was	4041	A
what do you do with the other person it's particularly hard if they live away	4041	A
um-hum	4041	A
yeah	4041	A
well that's a problem and i uh my grandmother was ninety	4041	A
two ninety three when she died and she was able to stay in her apartment but the but the cost of that was unbelievable to have the nurses now i don't know that it would have been any better in a nursing home but at that point	4041	A
it was you know uh she was old enough that it was like that's where she- she wanted to die was where she was not to	4041	A
staying at home yeah not going somewhere else i think it's harder if they if they're younger but need a lot of care	4041	A
you know at ninety that's one thing at at sixty or seventy it's something else and yet	4041	A
right right	4041	A
right exactly and if the and and yet if the care is just is just so hard then that's	4041	A
you know that's really hard and i don't know what you know what the different things that you would look for i mean obviously uh you want it to be clean- you know	4041	A
clean and that that it's got a good reputation as far as health et cetera but then atmosphere seems like would make so much difference	4041	A
yes that that's the picture you always see of people just sitting in the halls	4041	A
oh	4041	A
Alzheimer yeah	4041	A
uh-huh	4041	A
yeah	4041	A
well i that's the thing i mean when it's something like that i- i think it particularly if it's something like that and they really don't know where they are	4041	A
it doesn't feel i would think that would be easier than someone who really does know and is saying i don't-	4041	A
exactly	4041	A
and i you know i don't- i don't want to go kind of thing but the other side of it is that my grandmother	4041	A
moved out of her home and into an apartment of elderly people but it is was not a nursing home and that's where she died but she lived there for ten or twelve years	4041	A
and she did she really went through uh like a depression for about a year moving out of her home but then she said	4041	A
well- she says course this is so wonderful because all i have to do is open my door you know go out the hall and down stairs to the place to eat or down stairs to the lobby and there're people there	4041	A
which in her home you know there weren't i mean the logistics of it become so difficult that she said i've i've really made some friends and that feels good so that's the other side of it is	4041	A
um-hum um-hum	4041	A
yeah but but it's just that	4041	A
you know how do you i guess unless you visit a lot and unexpectedly and assuming that you can visit unexpectedly	4041	A
uh-huh	4041	A
exactly and how everything looks and and then and then the other thing is really listen to what they say because and that's another hard thing	4041	A
uh you know if the as people get older we we all seem to uh	4041	A
fuss just a little bit more about everything so then the question is is the fussing legitimate or not	4041	A
uh-huh	4041	A
so they'll tell you well she says she doesn't like the food but you should see her plate you know or some	4041	A
so then you- i guess you'd have to be there to be sure that that's	4041	A
well uh i don't know i think the budget is really out of hand right now and especially in this election year i think that uh	4022	A
there ought to be some- at least some conversation about what we are supposed to do about this	4022	A
right	4022	A
right and uh well as you said mostly they are token cuts uh especially what for instance George Bush is offering	4022	A
yeah ninety seven cents a week now what that's really not gonna do a lot of good it doesn't seem to me to your average middle income person you know another ninety seven cents hell you can buy a Coke or something for that	4022	A
yeah	4022	A
nah that ninety seven cents really isn't gonna do it for me either uh	4022	A
i i haven't really heard much of what the other people other candidates have said that has made a lot of sense to me either especially the Democratic candidates uh don't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as yeah maybe that could	4022	A
do something to affect our budget at this point	4022	A
i believe it was Dukakis but i i can't	4022	A
yeah i mean that's better than George Bush who came out and said no i will not read my lips or whatever and then you know ten months later he said well sorry you know i i can't follow through on this but it seems to me that uh	4022	A
that the budget is so out of hand and especially now that they say okay the cold war is over and we're supposed to be getting a peace dividend of you know of X number of billion trillion dollars a year well i'd really like to know where- where that money is actually gonna go because	4022	A
in my opinion i don't think i'm ever gonna see any of this peace so called peace dividend	4022	A
i mean if they could actually put- put something together and make i'm not really in favor of large government social programs either because_1 i feel that they waste money also but with this peace dividend it seems like you could set up some kind of like public works	4022	A
projects like they had in the thirties or whatever	4022	A
right exactly-	4022	A
exactly and in that way we could really focus on building the infrastructure- structure of the country	4022	A
yeah and and there's no way that we can ever really recover from from the state that we're in right now unless at least i feel unless we focus on the infrastructure and i surely don't hear anybody saying that right now	4022	A
so am i	4022	A
uh IU	4022	A
uh-huh	4022	A
um-hum	4022	A
right	4022	A
right	4022	A
uh-huh	4022	A
right	4022	A
you you just have to wonder what they're thinking in Washington	4022	A
yeah uh well it's it's more than a loaded it's a loaded cannon i mean they've got trillions of dollars to spend every year and they in my opinion don't do a very responsible job of spending that money	4022	A
oh no	4022	A
uh-huh	4022	A
for the for the moment and that's what really is getting me about what George Bush's stand on the budget is right now is that he is saying i am gonna give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that you'll be happy come November and you'll elect me again	4022	A
and then i'm gonna go on and just forget everything that i said or you know it doesn't seem that it's gonna make much of a difference	4022	A
no no not at all	4022	A
no	4022	A
um-hum	4022	B
yeah see it like seems to me you know that everyone's offering you know their token little tax cut program you know when it's when it's just such a bad time for it you know	4022	B
no	4022	B
it the ninety seven cents a week	4022	B
uh-huh	4022	B
hell i mean mostly you know it's it's not actually a a a cut it's just a cut in the with hold in the amount with held you know	4022	B
um yeah i don't just don't see it changing my life style a whole lot	4022	B
um-hum	4022	B
um-hum yeah i mean you know in in retrospect um was it was it Mondale or Dukakis that said you know i'll i'll tell you right now i'm gonna raise taxes	4022	B
yeah um-hum	4022	B
um-hum	4022	B
um-hum	4022	B
oh yeah i know it it's	4022	B
um-hum	4022	B
um-hum	4022	B
oh yeah i i yeah i i think that would be a great idea you know like the conservation corps you know where it would- it would- it would help unemployment greatly	4022	B
and it	4022	B
yeah our infrastructure is in is in i mean we we've we've hurt ourselves incredibly over the last fifty- fifty years of the cold war yeah	4022	B
um-hum	4022	B
um-hum um yeah i i agree totally um	4022	B
i mean we this this it just seems so you know so ridiculous that it was allowed to happen um i i'm in college right now and oh really where do you go	4022	B
right i go to Georgia Tech um and in my i had political- you know the required political science class a couple of years ago	4022	B
and one of the things we discussed was you know were where the budget situation- how how the budget situation just got so out of hand and essentially what happened was and i think it was like in eighty- in the um tax year of eighty one um	4022	B
Ronald Reagan basically said you know	4022	B
i'm gonna give this much of a tax cut to the tax payers and and and created this this ludicrous budget that he knew that that um	4022	B
that the Congress would not in the right mind pass and Congress- Congress realizing that they were gonna lose a the Democratic Congress realizing that they were gonna lose a propaganda war you know by by you know slicing- by by removing the tax cut	4022	B
further cut the taxes and created you know that that that you know what- created the the huge deficit that year which moved us into the trillion dollar deficit	4022	B
and you just i mean it's just	4022	B
i mean it's just like you know playing chicken with a loaded gun	4022	B
yeah	4022	B
um-hum well yeah and what really bothers me is it just seems like if if anyone were to say you know well i'm gonna raise taxes	4022	B
and cut the budget and we're gonna have you know we're we're gonna we're gonna have to do some unpopular things i mean he wouldn't have a chance of getting elected	4022	B
i mean it's kind of like Rome and the bread and circuses thing you know where where people just want want to have	4022	B
you know what ever will make them feel good right now you know and	4022	B
um-hum	4022	B
um-hum	4022	B
um-hum	4022	B
um-hum yeah that i mean i don't know i i	4022	B
well i just don't think it was a well thought out incentive	4022	B
yes	4055	B
uh yes i'm a scoutmaster in Boy Scouts	4055	B
i camp uh every month uh camp at least one weekend and during the summer we camp uh two or three weeks a year	4055	B
i'd say i camp quite a bit	4055	B
well uh we we do a lot of canoeing when we go camping	4055	B
and we uh we also uh carry all our equipment with us	4055	B
and so we canoe down the river and then sleep on the river on one of the uh sand bars and then get up the next morning cook our breakfast and go down the river again	4055	B
how about_1 yourself	4055	B
-well that's good	4055	B
um-hum	4055	B
great	4055	B
what uh what kind of camping do they like best do they like it where they have tents and uh do they cook on stoves	4055	B
um-hum	4055	B
uh-huh of- course i imagine it gets cold in parts of Utah	4055	B
it doesn't get very cold in Texas	4055	B
so lots of times we don't even take tents	4055	B
we just use trail tarps	4055	B
uh it's just a piece of material that has uh that has a lot of	4055	B
uh places where you can tie off to it and make it into a tent	4055	B
uh like a uh they're very light weight and we use them_1 when we go backpacking	4055	B
so we go backpacking fifteen or twenty miles then uh they're not very heavy see so you carry them_1 with you and	4055	B
they'll keep you dry or whatever	4055	B
um-hum	4055	B
yes- yes in fact uh um last month we went camping we saw a lot of deer	4055	B
uh in the morning and in the afternoon just deer everywhere	4055	B
uh so uh but it even though uh it wasn't hunting season and we were with Boy Scouts so of course we don't uh want to go hunting	4055	B
but we got to see a lot of deer	4055	B
um out and about and there's of course we see smaller animals all the time and uh one thing that is a big concern in the evening at night uh is uh make sure that all the food's put away and so forth	4055	B
because uh we have uh armadillos do you know what a armadillo is	4055	B
um-hum	4055	B
and possums and uh raccoons	4055	B
and uh we have those uh creatures down here that they like to uh	4055	B
they like to go hunting for a a midnight snack	4055	B
and so that that uh that can be a problem if you don't put all your equipment away	4055	B
they will if you attack them	4055	B
but most time they run away from you	4055	B
if you- if they see- if they see you're up you know	4055	B
but they don't have any problem walking right by you if you're asleep	4055	B
so	4055	B
okay Bill right	4055	A
okay Bill have you done much camping	4055	A
ah ha	4055	A
oh well that that sounds good	4055	A
yes you do um now do you have a lot of mountain well you don't have mountains in Texas do you where do you find places to camp	4055	A
oh	4055	A
uh-huh	4055	A
oh	4055	A
oh my word well that sounds adventuresome	4055	A
well um i've done oh i would say quite a bit of camping mostly with my husband and i	4055	A
um we have five children and so we have found that camping with the little ones isn't as enjoyable as just when we go ourselves so we've tried to get out once a year and go	4055	A
on a anniversary camp out and we have gone up into the mountains and uh not necessarily roughed it but we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains	4055	A
and then the boys are our boys are old enough now they're twelve and eleven and so they're involved- involved in the scouting and they do a lot of camping with the scouts	4055	A
and last year my one twelve year old went to the scout camp for a week and	4055	A
so this year they'll both be going and so that's been real enjoyable for them	4055	A
so	4055	A
um yes they've well	4055	A
no actually they've i remember they have taken the the Dutch- the heavy cast iron Dutch ovens and done their cooking there over the fire	4055	A
and i don't think they've taken the stoves um last year they camped in tents	4055	A
and this year i believe it will be in tents also	4055	A
so	4055	A
uh-huh yeah	4055	A
oh is that right	4055	A
oh and what does that consist of	4055	A
oh	4055	A
uh-huh	4055	A
uh-huh	4055	A
oh	4055	A
yes uh see when when when we go camping here we have to take our big huge heavy sleeping bags and lots of tents and	4055	A
i like to sleep on the air mattresses i don't- am not my bones are getting so old so i like to i like to sleep on the mattresses	4055	A
um	4055	A
so have you had any adventures on your camping trips with encounters with wild animals or anything like that	4055	A
oh	4055	A
my word	4055	A
jeez	4055	A
uh-huh	4055	A
oh	4055	A
oh	4055	A
oh uh they're covered with like a heavy armor	4055	A
type stuff uh-huh	4055	A
my word	4055	A
uh-huh	4055	A
oh but they won't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything	4055	A
oh	4055	A
uh-huh	4055	A
uh-huh	4055	A
oh my word	4055	A
well that sounds a little less fierce than bears we	4055	A
we want to go	4055	A
oh	4060	B
okay i was just going to say i think one of the biggest thing for me is like the room for advancement	4060	B
you know not to get in like in a dead end job	4060	B
and plus	4060	B
for me it's uh i mean like medical and you know uh benefits and dental	4060	B
they're also important	4060	B
um	4060	B
um	4060	B
are they like well- pretty much trained for a specific job and that what's their hired for and then uh	4060	B
just- just very little variation from there	4060	B
um-hum	4060	B
um-hum	4060	B
well you know that's kind of interesting though because i don't know if that's necessarily the case anymore i use to think that you know after you worth	4060	B
you mean security job security	4060	B
um	4060	B
that use to be i think a couple of years ago but i don't know	4060	B
if it is so much anymore in fact they we just had a lay off in what November i guess	4060	B
but um it wasn't necessarily i mean you know some people had been there a long time	4060	B
um-hum	4060	B
um-hum	4060	B
um-hum and there's no doubt yeah	4060	B
expedient- yeah that's exactly it yeah where the most dollar what it where it you know cuts back the most	4060	B
oh	4060	B
oh see yeah	4060	B
yeah i think that's one of the things too you get too many management people you know	4060	B
yeah and it's very easy for them to say oh this is the best way when they really aren't aware of what all it took to get the work done you know	4060	B
yeah	4060	B
um-hum	4060	B
yeah but so what else do you think is important	4060	B
um-hum	4060	B
um-hum	4060	B
um-hum	4060	B
i think probably in a smaller yeah i was going to say more it's more personal for one thing you probably have a better team	4060	B
uh cooperation or team playing atmosphere	4060	B
probably where as in a bigger corporation sometimes i think- you think you're just a number you know	4060	B
um-hum	4060	B
um-hum	4060	B
whereas yeah in a smaller i think you'd be more willing to either help that person or help it	4060	B
get accomplished you know	4060	B
um-hum	4060	B
okay Karen you're you're first	4060	A
uh-huh	4060	A
okay	4060	A
yeah i guess one of the differences i see is uh working for a university uh	4060	A
there is room for advancement but not so much so our in uh	4060	A
quite a highly unionized environment and then also in an in administrative association so there is a	4060	A
progressive path but	4060	A
not being in the	4060	A
say the commercial sector the motivation isn't there for a lot of people	4060	A
uh like	4060	A
really	4060	A
yeah somewhat that but then also there just isn't the ability to in one sense have uh	4060	A
a broader scope for rewarding people for	4060	A
uh their performances	4060	A
um so that's	4060	A
in in our situation where we're dealing with an institution	4060	A
uh it's a little more difficult to recognize an individual's performance	4060	A
and i suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution	4060	A
perhaps somewhat even with the business	4060	A
uh but i agree you know the uh medical benefits and those kinds of things are	4060	A
one of the	4060	A
big pluses for working for a large organization and also the uh	4060	A
security aspect for long term employment uh	4060	A
job security yes	4060	A
uh-huh	4060	A
yeah uh we're seeing that here as well like in some of the large oil companies there has been massive layoffs	4060	A
uh so i i think there it's probably a major distinction between	4060	A
institutions and the corporate world	4060	A
in uh institutions are slower to	4060	A
react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses	4060	A
we need to cut back that's what we do	4060	A
but	4060	A
yeah and institutionally like here at the university	4060	A
oh if there is a cut back well gee it's not where it necessarily is needed it's where it's most expedient which	4060	A
well in one sense- sense for us it's where it makes the least noise which means it's often the lowest support type roles	4060	A
so we end	4060	A
it's very easy	4060	A
yeah	4060	A
right because it's the support people that are providing the speed for it	4060	A
well	4060	A
the uh	4060	A
uh that's- that's maybe the majority of the importance i guess	4060	A
uh yeah because my perspective is from an institution	4060	A
uh the there is not much incentive for	4060	A
innovativeness because the the limitation for reward is is very severe	4060	A
but if you're in the corporate world i think there is considerable motivation for	4060	A
uh i guess in innovation although	4060	A
he the you know the more complex your structure	4060	A
the uh less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through	4060	A
but uh i think there is uh	4060	A
it's a long term type of process where in a small organization it's uh	4060	A
things can happen much more quickly and so you can see the reward of your efforts	4060	A
right	4060	A
yeah you end up being your own person	4060	A
and uh if you do your job fine and if	4060	A
somebody else is messing it up well then that's their problem and	4060	A
you know you really	4060	A
yeah yeah it becomes the organization instead of	4060	A
person being uh you know a part of the individual themselves	4060	A
well what do you think about how we've changed in the last ten twenty years	4005	A
in in like in what ways particularly are you thinking	4005	A
uh-huh	4005	A
disintegrating	4005	A
yeah it seems that well it its a seems like it's definitely a transitional time i'm not sure	4005	A
exactly what's happening there're good things that have happened but but at the moment we're suffering from	4005	A
i think information overload for one thing um just just the technology like you mentioned	4005	A
faxes and car phones and VCRs and all of that that make us so immediate there- there's no time for	4005	A
relationships talking sitting being with each other all of that	4005	A
oh yes	4005	A
um-hum	4005	A
exactly no patience	4005	A
no attention span	4005	A
these sound bites you're exactly right i mean all there's all that and then we've got the rich getting richer and everyone else getting poorer	4005	A
with with you know with with little hope of of having any impact i think impotence is a	4005	A
is a a word that that suits most of America now we don't feel like we can influence- you know influence anything	4005	A
uh-huh uh-huh like just a few people have it all wrapped up and they're not going to let you through um	4005	A
and it's a bad feeling	4005	A
um-hum	4005	A
um-hum	4005	A
yeah go ahead	4005	A
um-hum um-hum	4005	A
yeah then that's	4005	A
um-hum the interdependence- interdependence in a nice way	4005	A
yeah i think uh i- i don't know there was a lot there was good and bad in the nuclear family we've certainly found out a lot about the bad about it	4005	A
uh but but but the community	4005	A
however the family looked and it didn't always look like a nuclear family even then you know you had generations living together or you know whatever community has just definitely been lost and	4005	A
i think a lot of people are trying to reestablish it in all sorts of different ways um you know well okay so we don't have a small town and okay so we move but	4005	A
you know maybe there's some way that we can have a group that works together you know everything from people who do live in communal you know almost commune areas that they've started up again you know	4005	A
um special cities or little towns that do that to people who do it through a church or through a book club or something- i mean something you know even offices have started sort of becoming the community	4005	A
yeah	4005	A
um-hum and yeah	4005	A
yeah	4005	A
yeah and that's a good point and and we don't have the intergenerational- generational	4005	A
community either which means that do you do you have to be between twenty and forty to be accepted and if-	4005	A
i think it's pretty amazing i think um that my grandparents especially have seen a whole lot of change in their lives but um	4005	B
well technology but also morals- morals and things like that i think even even in the last like four years you can still see things falling so fast and that can be	4005	B
for me that's the biggest change it's so frustrating um to see everything	4005	B
disintegrating and losing control- your your losing control it seems like of the moral fiber of our society	4005	B
um-hum	4005	B
um-hum	4005	B
i think you're really right i think like well even with computers um	4005	B
you can there i mean there's so much that's happening in in that field and it	4005	B
it just has forced us to go so fast and	4005	B
um even the way we write it used to be if you read a book like you know Thomas Hardy takes two chapters to establish the mood and	4005	B
and just describes the scenery and what's been going on and stuff and now we just chopped all that out and say well let's get to the point and	4005	B
yeah	4005	B
yeah exactly	4005	B
yeah you feel out of control	4005	B
yeah	4005	B
um-hum	4005	B
um-hum	4005	B
yeah it is it's really frustrating and the way our families you know our nuclear families are	4005	B
disintegrating and stuff it's just a real	4005	B
you don't have the the social networks we used to have to	4005	B
to protect the family and protect the people in the family and things like that with everyone moving	4005	B
you know every five years you lose your contacts you lose trusted friends that you know they'll do things you know in America it seems now it's independence is the thing and	4005	B
you know heaven forbid if you ask anyone for anything	4005	B
whereas we used to be able to depend on each other and trust each other and	4005	B
you'll help me and i'll help you not and not in this corrupted sense but in the sense of	4005	B
you know when you're in trouble and you need someone- you know someone to babysit the kids sure	4005	B
yeah	4005	B
exactly	4005	B
yeah	4005	B
um-hum	4005	B
yeah	4005	B
yeah i think i think because it's a necessity	4005	B
as as as human beings we need a network around us of people we can rely on i guess- that's uh thing is that right now it's such a um	4005	B
temporary thing that how far does it go how far can you depend on them and they're so much more fragile at the touch you know	4005	B
well we	4063	B
we try	4063	B
it's it's not as easy as i had thought it would be but last year i started keeping a total of our expenses and and where they were all going and i have uh a budget book that i use	4063	B
if you had a people that have personal computers it would be much easier	4063	B
but um and then at the end of the year i- i totaled up what we were spending say for groceries or or entertainment or things like that and then this year i tried to keep it within	4063	B
you know a bounds there and then if there's if we are over budget in one item if we want to apply that to another one i try to do that but it's not always	4063	B
easy when you have extra expenses say the car repairs came up this month things like that that you're not expecting	4063	B
i don't really know how some people stay within a budget	4063	B
do you have kids	4063	B
one we don't have any because_1 i thought if well if we had a child i don't know what we'd do	4063	B
but my husband gets paid once a week and i get paid every two weeks	4063	B
and uh then every three months i have a bonus check and but then that's when we we try to put some a side at that time	4063	B
as far as savings uh i take out of each pay check i put so much into a four O one K plan in a profit sharing	4063	B
and then he does the same thing he puts one into uh a stock plan at his company and also into a retirement plan	4063	B
because to me that's the only way we're ever going save- to be able to save	4063	B
because if the money comes in it's spent if it's not taken out before i get it	4063	B
oh yeah	4063	B
that's very hard	4063	B
um-hum	4063	B
yeah they say how old is he	4063	B
he's five they say by the time	4063	B
kids his age are ready to go to college it's gonna be about seventy thousand dollars a year for college	4063	B
and it's just unbelievable	4063	B
you know i i'm just twenty nine and when i went it was probably five hundred dollars a semester for the tuition books and everything	4063	B
um-hum where is she going	4063	B
yeah	4063	B
i'm sure it is	4063	B
oh yeah is she started having do the uh working at the hospitals	4063	B
has she started doing any of work at the hospitals	4063	B
yeah because i i've got a friend that just graduated and took her test to to be an R N and i i think towards the last year they were working at the hospitals and then they all had to buy all the uniforms and	4063	B
and all the things which was an added expense	4063	B
but it is hard i don't know in in compared to say my mother and father	4063	B
living in a budget was no problem	4063	B
it was just this is what we have and this is what we spend but that's in this time and you know i don't know what it is it's well it's	4063	B
you know my husband let's go play some golf you know something like that or let let's run to the mall with me and and before- you know	4063	B
parent's didn't do that if they didn't have the money they didn't get it and we're not that way	4063	B
um-hum	4063	B
um-hum	4063	B
and it's hard	4063	B
and as far as like the you know with interest rates now as low as they are	4063	B
credit card rates are still	4063	B
sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen percent	4063	B
uh well we have a budget we go by every pay check since i have been in the service we get paid twice a month so that's what i go by	4063	A
uh	4063	A
um-hum	4063	A
uh-huh	4063	A
oh yeah i can i can understand that	4063	A
got one kid	4063	A
yeah	4063	A
yeah	4063	A
yeah	4063	A
oh yeah i	4063	A
yeah i understand that right- right now that's just the problem i have and we don't ain't been able to save any because i am putting my wife through school right now	4063	A
through nursing school so it's kind of	4063	A
got to	4063	A
{maxed} out right now but	4063	A
we try to put a little away every- every month you know and plus we've got child care which we got to put in there and everything and	4063	A
we try to put a little away for his you know school education and stuff for later on	4063	A
he's five	4063	A
yeah	4063	A
yep	4063	A
well- that's	4063	A
yeah if you yeah it's kind of expensive for her you know going to nursing school nursing school is one of the more expensive ones	4063	A
uh U T A	4063	A
uh	4063	A
and you know	4063	A
the the uh budget part kind of falls in there you know you get unexpected expenses and stuff	4063	A
for that because_1 she has to drive about twenty thirty minutes every day to school and that	4063	A
that adds more to the gas budget	4063	A
do what ma'am	4063	A
uh no she goes they have a class there every Tuesday and that's what they do and then she'll start during her senior year	4063	A
uh going to the hospital three times a week so	4063	A
yeah	4063	A
um-hum	4063	A
yeah yeah i understand	4063	A
that's the same problem we fall into you know	4063	A
you know when we do have a little extra we try to go out and do a little something you know	4063	A
be with the kids a little bit during that time and	4063	A
kind of a family deal	4063	A
how do you feel about gun control	4077	A
um	4077	A
uh-huh	4077	A
uh-huh	4077	A
well don't you think that you know just having you know some	4077	A
you know almost like a driver's license be required you know with stiff penalties if you are found with with you know	4077	A
you know a gun that is not registered or you know that you are not licensed to carry	4077	A
i mean	4077	A
it varies from State to State	4077	A
there is no national	4077	A
uh in most States as long as you aren't a convicted felon	4077	A
you know or on probation or you know	4077	A
other obvious things like that	4077	A
uh and i know i know that like in a lot of states you could you could be just like released from a mental hospital the day before	4077	A
you know be be obviously insane and then you you know but have your legal right to get a gun	4077	A
uh	4077	A
uh yes i'd probably i'd probably say about a five	4077	A
seems like it's a good safe number to pick you know	4077	A
uh-huh	4077	A
uh-huh	4077	A
uh-huh well you know uh uh other than that if you are looking at like	4077	A
you know country that you know uh where they do have a lot more gun control like England and places like that you know the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much	4077	A
well i mean yeah the uh the in comparing you know per- per capita murders are incredibly lower than the United States	4077	A
uh	4077	A
you know i mean the problem though is you know they if the since the United States has you know had this you know pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long	4077	A
that i think you know if you were introduced	4077	A
you know any controls	4077	A
it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out there already	4077	A
you know so it's so it's really into a kind of a complex problem	4077	A
uh	4077	A
i'm not really sure how bad it is i've i've not really had that many problems with it but i mean apparently we we were ranked pretty high up	4077	A
uh	4077	A
um-hum	4077	A
i mean like i think you know in the i mean i- i think we have been like ranked in like one of the top three for murders in the last few years	4077	A
uh-huh	4077	A
no i've i've thought about getting one if i get one i think i will probably you know get something	4077	A
i probably wouldn't get a hand gun i would probably get like a shotgun just for protecting myself	4077	A
you know from you know burglar type thing like i do kind of live in the downtown area	4077	A
you know and shotguns are really good because you know they're	4077	A
i mean somebody is not going to break in steal it and you know use it to mug someone you know	4077	A
uh and you know you	4077	A
yeah i just don't i just don't understand these people you know that like when they they decide they're going to buy a gun to protect themselves they go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through you know	4077	A
they are probably going to miss the person and they're going shoot- and they're going to shoot through five wall and hit hit someone you know	4077	A
i mean a shotgun just just struck me as being you know a real good defensive weapon you can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of you know whoever	4077	A
you pretty you pretty much stop them and you don't have to worry- you know you- and then and then the actual shot doesn't go that far you know a wall will stop it pretty much	4077	A
uh-huh	4077	A
uh-huh	4077	A
uh-huh	4077	A
uh-huh	4077	A
yeah that that's they yeah that really does scare me people you know that have guns because you know	4077	A
if you ever get in the situation where you know you are not prepared to shoot but you pick up the gun and point it at the person that that person rushes you	4077	A
you know you're pretty much dead you know because you you've just told the person that you you're about to kill them then	4077	A
you know and and well i mean	4077	A
stop you	4077	A
uh-huh	4077	A
uh-huh	4077	A
um	4077	A
yeah the did it happen at a cafeteria or something	4077	A
uh-huh	4077	A
well uh	4077	B
i mean i don't think that guns should be outlawed	4077	B
but it's going to a lot of the stuff that i mean all you do is to get guns	4077	B
and then like with the stuff of that massacre in Killeen Texas not too long ago	4077	B
but i don't really know i mean unless they do uh just outlaw them_1 how you can uh i mean prevent that	4077	B
yeah that well do you even know what the procedures are now	4077	B
um	4077	B
but it's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun especially if you have the money to pay for it	4077	B
yeah	4077	B
huh i didn't know that well that's pretty scary	4077	B
so does now do they want us to say where we feel about it like in rating it one to ten	4077	B
well i mean i mean i don't really know what they can how they can really enforce the laws any better	4077	B
because i mean i do think that some people need them_1 and like for protection and stuff and i can understand them_1 wanting to have them_1 but then again it's just like all those nutcases out there	4077	B
it has	4077	B
because	4077	B
hum	4077	B
yeah	4077	B
well is the crime that bad there in Atlanta	4077	B
yeah i know Dallas is	4077	B
i don't know if Dallas is in the top three but oh do you own a gun	4077	B
uh-huh	4077	B
yeah	4077	B
that's true	4077	B
yeah	4077	B
well	4077	B
well now when i first moved to Dallas i moved up here by myself and uh my dad gave me a gun	4077	B
but i never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it	4077	B
so i finally ended up giving it back to him i said i don't want it i don't want to be responsible for it because	4077	B
you know if you're not going to teach me how to do it and if i am not going to you know be responsible enough to go out and learn i don't need it	4077	B
and they get it from you uh-huh	4077	B
set them off	4077	B
yeah	4077	B
well that's why i ended up giving it back to him i thought well you know	4077	B
i don't want it if i don't know how to operate- you know if i don't really know how to use it and i just didn't want the responsibility	4077	B
so	4077	B
well well uh	4077	B
did you hear about that Killeen massacre or whatever	4077	B
yeah right	4077	B
that kind of	4077	B
i mean it just makes you wonder how people get guns	4077	B
i would be scared selling guns to people	4077	B
yes	4052	B
they range in age from twenty four down to five	4052	B
not- not really my wife has provided the child care up to now	4052	B
that's the easiest one	4052	B
do you have children	4052	B
and have you been into child care	4052	B
uh-huh	4052	B
right	4052	B
well i think one of the things you kind of have to do is decide what you want out of day care or out of preschool you know do you want a real academic one or do you want one that's more for socialization purposes	4052	B
uh you know i i think those are some sort of critical issues we see a lot- i see a lot of programs that are really geared to get the kids ready for school and i see others that are sort of more oriented towards fun for the kids	4052	B
me too the last thing they need at that age is academics	4052	B
well we generally with most of our kids there were well with our oldest one they didn't have kindergarten in Texas	4052	B
and so we sent her to a private kindergarten and that was really her first exposure	4052	B
with the others we've either	4052	B
with some friends done a	4052	B
a sort of Mother's Day out kind of thing where they took turns	4052	B
a couple of times a week or we've actually put them into a little preschool at about age four just for a year's kind of socialization and again to give my wife a little bit of relief	4052	B
yeah	4052	B
oh we have eight children so	4052	B
there's a lot of space in between i mean there's not an awful lot of space in between them	4052	B
uh she was in college actually when the baby was born	4052	B
very good	4052	B
oh	4052	B
no and she kind of really wanted him i mean she wanted us to have him so she was real excited about it	4052	B
and uh she has a child of her own now that's just a couple of years younger than he is	4052	B
my son is a	4052	B
yeah right	4052	B
yeah	4052	B
yeah	4052	B
no	4052	B
now we've we're into the grand type child period now that's much better	4052	B
they live about uh	4052	B
four hours from here they're in San Antonio	4052	B
yeah	4052	B
uh no right now she's staying home taking care of her kids or her husband is in school still	4052	B
and uh so she works a little night job to help him through school and he stays home and takes care of the kids in the evening	4052	B
so they've been able to work that out so far she doesn't wanna go back to work if she can avoid it	4052	B
and- me too	4052	B
i don't know what you hear in California but you know there's a lot of	4052	B
so um do you have children of your own	4052	A
uh how old are they	4052	A
ah so have you had to deal with this uh child care question yourself	4052	A
uh	4052	A
uh-huh	4052	A
uh that certainly is the most straightforward	4052	A
yeah	4052	A
i do i have uh one son who will be three in May and uh we're expecting another in May	4052	A
no not yet although- my wife stays home also uh we're starting to look into maybe a preschool	4052	A
a couple of hours a day for the older one next year	4052	A
uh	4052	A
just to give him a little more time with other kids and to give my wife a little more time with the the baby	4052	A
uh but otherwise i- i mean even just looking for that has been kind of difficult finding one that you really like and that doesn't have some uh	4052	A
major disadvantages	4052	A
um-hum	4052	A
um-hum	4052	A
yes that's true that's true uh	4052	A
and i would tend to lean toward the fun at this age	4052	A
yeah i mean they'll get it eventually anyhow uh how- how old are your kids when they started some sort of school	4052	A
um-hum	4052	A
um	4052	A
uh-huh	4052	A
uh-huh	4052	A
uh-huh	4052	A
uh-huh	4052	A
yeah it sounds like we'll be doing something similar and my wife was thinking of uh starting up a little preschool	4052	A
maybe just with a few other mothers and it would be sort of a mom it would end up being a mom's day off thing because_1 they would take turns	4052	A
um	4052	A
uh-huh	4052	A
oh so that's quite a spread twenty four to five	4052	A
wow that's great	4052	A
um	4052	A
so did now the twenty four year old was was nineteen when the five year old was born has she been at home	4052	A
uh-huh	4052	A
what kind of what's their relationship like	4052	A
uh-huh	4052	A
it would be	4052	A
very interesting- i mean old enough i mean really	4052	A
no sibling rivalry there i would expect	4052	A
uh-huh	4052	A
uh-huh	4052	A
oh yeah i always had friends in school who had an uncle	4052	A
uh	4052	A
hold it no that child is	4052	A
wait a minute this should be very simple	4052	A
that child is your son's nephew	4052	A
that's right yeah i always had friends who had an uncle who was a year younger or the same age and i always thought that was neat	4052	A
yeah	4052	A
uh but they were pretty close at least compared to me and my uncle whose about forty years older	4052	A
um	4052	A
um	4052	A
do you plan to have more children	4052	A
all said	4052	A
um	4052	A
oh yeah i would think that would have a lot of rewards does your does your daughter live nearby	4052	A
oh well	4052	A
well that's accessible for a weekend um does she have to worry about child care	4052	A
uh-huh	4052	A
oh it sounds great	4052	A
uh-huh	4052	A
yeah yeah i wish i could stay home with the kid	4052	A
um	4052	A
but it is nice to i mean i- i find it	4052	A
it really gives me peace of mind to know that my wife is home	4052	A
with our son you know as as far as knowing what kind of care he's getting	4052	A
all right	4024	B
yeah	4024	B
i like Country and it's really hard to find people that enjoy country music	4024	B
in my age	4024	B
because i'm twenty two and most people my age like hard rock and	4024	B
not me i think it was the stupidest thing ever invented	4024	B
i still like country music and	4024	B
so it's kind of hard for me to find people i agree with on music	4024	B
oh no	4024	B
i- i have to be here right now because_1 my husband's in the Navy	4024	B
but i'm going home first opportunity i get	4024	B
Arizona	4024	B
oh yeah i- i was born in a little tiny town that that's all they have	4024	B
it has a population of about three hundred people and all they know is country music	4024	B
i mean they still have barn dances and stuff	4024	B
yeah it is pretty fun	4024	B
oh really	4024	B
yeah my husband's leaving March twelfth he has to go out to sea again	4024	B
so	4024	B
well usually they stay out six to nine months but this time they're only going out for i think it's two weeks this time because_1 they're just they're just doing their sea trials making sure they're ready to go out to sea again	4024	B
yeah it gets kind of monotonous	4024	B
but i incorporated him into country music because_1 he didn't he didn't like it when we got married but since he married me and i was the country girl that's all i have going on at home	4024	B
so now he's gotten where he really likes country music and for my birthday he went out and he got me a brand new pair of Tony Llama boots and he bought himself a pair too and took me out country dancing	4024	B
yeah and all his friends tease him on the ship	4024	B
are you sure cowboys know how to swim	4024	B
he he gets upset about it but it's funny	4024	B
my my dad lives in Salt Lake	4024	B
yeah	4024	B
yeah i know how that goes i think country music's the only thing keeping me sane with these kids	4024	B
yeah	4024	B
yeah it is but	4024	B
i don't know it's worth it	4024	B
it's worth it to me	4024	B
yeah and it kind of has a bluesy mix to it yeah	4024	B
yeah	4024	B
do you know who Mariah Carey is	4024	B
i don't particularly like her kind of music but she's got a couple songs that i i i can listen to	4024	B
you know without going totally bonkers	4024	B
yeah but	4024	B
i don't know i just i guess i'm kind of the only country one that got left	4024	B
because_1 most people here most of the bars and everything are either hard rock or disco or um just a blues bar we've got several blues bars in the neighborhood- neighborhood	4024	B
and it's like uh guys what happened to juke boxes and sawdust on the floor you know	4024	B
and i- i asked that of a i went into a bar with my husband on our anniversary and i asked the guy i said have you ever heard of a a juke box and he goes yeah	4024	B
i said why don't you install one he goes what music do you want on it and i said country and he goes no way i'd lose all my clients and i'm like thanks	4024	B
okay now it's Sandy right	4024	A
Sandy um what kind of music do you like to listen to	4024	A

in fact i work in a bakery and the baker comes to work at four o'clock in the morning and i come to work at six o'clock in the morning	4024	A
and he just has the country music just a blasting and he just rocks and rolls in the bakery to country music	4024	A
oh	4024	A
i- i bet that's really hard being their alone with all those with the two little ones	4024	A
way it's a way of life for a while huh	4024	A
yeah that's good	4024	A
well um my favorite kind of music is New Age and it's that sounds like it's hard rock and roll but it's not it's the	4024	A
oh the synthesizers- synthesizers and all of that	4024	A
uh-huh and it's just beautiful i love it i	4024	A

oh oh	4024	A
Dave what kind of pets do you have	4074	A
one rotten cat	4074	A
i heard a laugh in the background	4074	A
oh you don't like cats	4074	A
oh yeah	4074	A
that said what does how does he treat the other people	4074	A
wow	4074	A
did he raise him or something	4074	A
uh-huh	4074	A
huh that's interesting	4074	A
huh we have a a mutt well we we named it Hooper because that's where we got it from uh some lady	4074	A
she uh a lot of people uh uh drop off abandoned abandoned pets at her house	4074	A
and she used to work for a veterinarian- veterinarian so she would spay uh neuter them	4074	A
give them_1 all their shots and we saw an ad saying it was free so we went down there and picked it up and it's been an excellent dog but this is my first dog i've i've had	4074	A
and we got it because well my wife stays here at home alone while i go to work so that's mostly why we got it to keep her company while i'm away at work	4074	A
um yeah right now it it is it's kind of good training i mean we've been trying for kids but right now we haven't had any but	4074	A
it's pretty good training i think i mean it it keeps us on our toes	4074	A
uh my brother has um we didn't do a lot with them_1 um i never felt it like it was mine or anything you couldn't do anything	4074	A
but i mean it's a bit more responsibility	4074	A
when it's yours and not your brother's	4074	A
but	4074	A
um-hum	4074	A
that's what we found ours is uh like a Cockapoo i think it's half Cocker Spaniel and half Poodle but it's a really good dog	4074	A
i don't know they seem to be i mean listen better or something is your cat a purebred	4074	A
uh-huh	4074	A
would you ever want a dog in the family	4074	A
um-hum	4074	A
oh yeah	4074	A
um-hum	4074	A
oh yeah	4074	A
um-hum	4074	A
um-hum	4074	A
um-hum	4074	A
wow	4074	A
they just need a lot of time-	4074	A
oh we have one rotten cat	4074	B
yeah it's my son's cat	4074	B
yeah that's the boys they they know i don't like it	4074	B
well i like cats this cat is a uh more like a dog	4074	B
yeah he's uh a a one owner	4074	B
he likes one boy in the family and that's about it	4074	B
just uh stays away or runs	4074	B
usually but he follows he'll follow my oldest son around	4074	B
you know when he's in the house he'll come up and he'll jump on his lap	4074	B
but if anybody reaches over to pet him or whatever he'll just kind of look at them_1 like what are you doing	4074	B
and	4074	B
he he's yeah- we bought the cat for him and so he's he's been the one that you know spent the most time with him	4074	B
but i i've never owned a cat like that i've had cats growing up all the time and you know they're usually either that way with everybody or friendly to everybody	4074	B
so it's a weird cat	4074	B
a mutt	4074	B
uh-huh	4074	B
oh	4074	B
um-hum	4074	B
uh-huh	4074	B
so that is that kind of your child right now	4074	B
you feel like	4074	B
oh uh-huh	4074	B
have have you had dogs before	4074	B
uh-huh	4074	B
yeah	4074	B
well i just um we've you know when i was growing up i had we always had a dog	4074	B
and we had mostly well not not mutts but mixes you know like one or one or two mix	4074	B
and those dogs always seem to be the best dogs	4074	B
uh-huh	4074	B
uh-huh	4074	B
yeah	4074	B
um-hum	4074	B
no no it's just uh	4074	B
an accident from a friend- from uh my son's friend down the street their their cat	4074	B
was an outside cat and just end up with some kittens and	4074	B
um we i would we um	4074	B
we had a dog that was a um	4074	B
mix between a an Alaskan Malamute and a Labrador	4074	B
and i should say a pup and he was just too big for our kids when we got him and we	4074	B
when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get was uh you know was a pet and and it was a dog that we gotten	4074	B
he was just- he was just too big um the kids couldn't handle him and i was still going to school	4074	B
and my wife was working and i was working and so we just didn't have time to really train him so he was kind of just there- you know he's too big for the kids to handle so he was just tied up to a post	4074	B
so we gave him to uh i don't know if you've there's a place out here on it's called Shorties Lane out here in Harrisville and they have um	4074	B
i guess it's kind of an animal shelter but he just takes a few of the animals in and some he destroys and some he keeps	4074	B
so we took him up there and he ended up keeping him	4074	B
um	4074	B
because_1 he's had him for six or seven years we we've	4074	B
saw him just a oh i guess about a year ago and uh i thought boy that sure looks like that pup we gave away and so we asked him about it one day and he said yeah he's been the best dog i've ever had in my life	4074	B
just goes everywhere with him i he would've been a great great dog	4074	B
think about what nursing home	4059	B
uh-huh	4059	B
yeah	4059	B
um-hum	4059	B
yeah	4059	B
well uh this my grandmother in fact uh has a personal care home and she keeps a couple of elderly ladies in her home	4059	B
and uh i live i live with her and so uh it's it's uh my mother also does the same thing	4059	B
and uh it's uh	4059	B
i think the quality of care they get is a a lot better uh	4059	B
and a lot more personal but uh	4059	B
no but uh i think it's uh quite a bit better than than a nursing home i i've just seen	4059	B
people just go down hill when they uh go into a nursing home	4059	B
that seems to be	4059	B
uh	4059	B
yeah	4059	B
yeah	4059	B
yeah	4059	B
yeah	4059	B
uh-huh	4059	B
well that's good	4059	B
yeah	4059	B
yeah	4059	B
i'm sorry what was that	4059	B
oh yeah	4059	B
um-hum	4059	B
um-hum	4059	B
uh oh	4059	B
yeah yeah i've seen some good ones and uh	4059	B
i've seen some uh my other grandmother was in one and it was	4059	B
i guess they it wasn't too bad but she uh she was a good way away from her family and uh	4059	B
kind of by herself there and it was it i didn't really like going there at all it was	4059	B
it was not a pleasant experience but uh i think there're some good ones out there's some here in Atlanta that are closing down it's	4059	B
apparently a shaky business right now	4059	B
yeah	4059	B
yeah	4059	B
yeah it is uh one of the ladies my grandmother has is apparently	4059	B
showing some signs of Alzheimer's and uh she'll	4059	B
my grandmother'll put her to bed and uh she'll get up you know anywhere from five to ten times and wonder where the bedroom is and you know that kind of thing so	4059	B
yeah it uh it takes a lot of patience	4059	B
but	4059	B
yeah she she's she's pretty good with them_1 though she does a real good job	4059	B
and uh oh i you know i would i would probably throw up my hands and quit but she just you know turn around put her put her back to bed	4059	B
you know which is good	4059	B
so i i hope i can provide that kind of care for my grandmother you know she's still going pretty strong but uh	4059	B
uh i i don't think i would	4059	B
wanna	4059	B
turn her over to a nursing home i i'd like to be in and i think that's the position of a lot of people but they can't afford it	4059	B
you know	4059	B
well my parents were both in them_1	4059	A
and my father-in-law and it's a tough decision to make	4059	A
because boy it really confines the uh the people	4059	A
and uh	4059	A
usually they don't care for it and kind of put you on a guilt trip	4059	A
but uh have you had any experience with them_1	4059	A
yeah	4059	A
yeah	4059	A
but it's still still not like home	4059	A
right	4059	A
yeah	4059	A
but uh you know and it's hard to really	4059	A
know what kind of a home is run	4059	A
unless you really know someone that's in there	4059	A
and	4059	A
you have to kind of take that with a grain of salt too	4059	A
that uh yeah they may say it's real bad	4059	A
uh just because they don't like it in there	4059	A
whereas it's you know usually pretty good	4059	A
uh uh the one my father-in-law was in had uh	4059	A
oh God entertainment every afternoon of some you know bingo or cards or whatever	4059	A
yeah	4059	A
and uh and it's easy to check out the meals you know just go up there during uh meal time if you can stand it	4059	A
because they don't eat that too well	4059	A
and uh	4059	A
go uh always- you always have to check it for cleanliness too	4059	A
well you have to make sure they're clean	4059	A
and they just had a incident in uh Dallas here	4059	A
where the guy's suing the nursing home	4059	A
he came in at ten in the morning	4059	A
check on his mom	4059	A
and she was sick	4059	A
and uh went up to the front desk and said what's wrong with my mom and they said what- is she sick	4059	A
we didn't know that	4059	A
and here she died two hours later	4059	A
yeah	4059	A
so you know	4059	A
and well- there's an awful lot of variables in them_1	4059	A
oh	4059	A
well i think Medicare and Medicaid payments are uh	4059	A
kind of tightening up on it	4059	A
but uh	4059	A
you know in some of them_1 some of them_1 try so darn- hard	4059	A
but caring for an elderly person who might be forgetful	4059	A
is ever ending	4059	A
well it's around the clock care	4059	A
yeah an awful lot	4059	A
and and gentleness too	4059	A
yeah	4059	A
costs a bunch	4059	A
my mother-in-law is uh eighty two	4059	A
and we'd probably put her in the same home that	4059	A
well uh i did did have you ever heard of a man named Milton Friedman	4027	A
yeah well no no he actually wasn't he he's an uh he was uh	4027	A
he's an anti government type uh fellow he's not really a commentator i don't i don't believe	4027	A
uh but he wrote several books years ago and and he put out like ten different movies on government and and uh	4027	A
and i'm a Milton- kind of a Milton Friedman fan and he's anti big government and that's that's my feeling about it i think our government is way too big um	4027	A
that there's just a tremendous amount of waste i'm i'm a CPA and i can- i see the way they uh butcher people as far as i'm concerned and uh	4027	A
in in in the in the tax end of it as as far as how they they	4027	A
take money from them_1	4027	A
you bet i do yep	4027	A
something interesting to me right now too is this presidential campaign uh i'd i can't believe how	4027	A
tax- you- you know our money our life really centers around money the whole thing and you can see uh how	4027	A
tax laws uh in new legislation right now are really a critical big issue	4027	A
uh-huh	4027	A
uh-huh	4027	A
that's- that's right	4027	A
uh-huh	4027	A
right	4027	A
the deficit the country's in right now is just incredible i heard a statistic the other day i don't know if this is wrong or right	4027	A
but for every man woman and child in the United States they're in debt uh about forty thousand dollars a piece	4027	A
i have a family of five if i had if i had to pay that much responsible for that much debt	4027	A
i'd be done i'd be sunk	4027	A
you know i just i there's no way i can generate the income to service that kind of debt	4027	A
i don't know what the heck our government's going to do one time um i i really personally think we're going to have to collapse just like the Soviet Union did	4027	A
or uh i i don't know how how how can we	4027	A
yeah right i don't see it in the near future but uh	4027	A
yeah because we write off debts we loaned the Mexican government five hundred million dollars or whatever and forgave them	4027	A
that's the same thing with what happened over there um in i and i believe it was Turkey We wanted to use their air strips during the Persian Gulf	4027	A
so we just went over there and said gee guys uh you owe us all this money well i tell you let us land our planes here and we'll just forgive it	4027	A
that's ridiculous	4027	A
and uh and i don't know if that's really the case you know i'm talking all out of hearsay and conversation from what i've heard uh from other from- from other some of my other associates but that wouldn't surprise me	4027	A
what do you think about the Japanese and the comments they've made recently about the American people i'm not sure that's actually a political issue but uh	4027	A
that's true	4027	A
and i'm not so sure they're all that wrong	4027	A
uh-huh	4027	A
right	4027	A
um so what do you think of um the way that the government has has moved towards you know getting involved in people's individual uh lives	4027	B
um yeah he's a commentator isn't he	4027	B
uh-huh	4027	B
uh-huh	4027	B
uh-huh	4027	B
uh-huh	4027	B
uh-huh	4027	B
and so do you sort of lean towards like the libertarian view	4027	B
uh-huh	4027	B
uh-huh	4027	B
uh-huh	4027	B
yeah and it means a horrible time to have tax cuts at this point	4027	B
i think you know as far at least as far as our deficit's concerned	4027	B
you know and everyone and every all the candidates just seem to be you know have this bread and circuses policy of	4027	B
you know we'll- we'll give you a dollar a day if you vote for us	4027	B
yeah yeah i mean your kids won't be happy but	4027	B
you'll be able to buy that that extra six pack of beer at the end of the week	4027	B
uh-huh	4027	B
uh-huh	4027	B
uh-huh	4027	B
it really wouldn't surprise me if that happens in the next twenty years	4027	B
um	4027	B
and we we we are still considered the best credit risk in the world	4027	B
supposedly	4027	B
uh-huh	4027	B
uh-huh	4027	B
uh-huh	4027	B
uh-huh	4027	B
yeah maybe i would	4027	B
we we've been known to spend a lot of money for expediency in things	4027	B
i uh um	4027	B
well it in it um	4027	B
i think if anyone but the Japanese had made it if if an American had said the same thing people probably would have agreed with them	4027	B
oh yeah yeah yeah	4027	B
um	4027	B
you know we we we our companies are have definitely become top heavy	4027	B
um in management um	4027	B
you know our	4027	B
we you know we we you know	4027	B
you know the trend of of over consumption since World War Two um	4027	B
you know theory being that that's what what what would be required to make our economy thrive the best you know that that we you know that the workers just been given that you know just moved for better and better standards of living	4027	B
and where a bunch of other factors i think you know is just	4027	B
you know it's it's uh we're we're unable to keep on increasing that	4027	B
you know when when you know when when you combine with the with the mismanagement that a lot of American companies have had	4027	B
and yeah i think that you know that's when he says that they were lazy- i think lazy probably wasn't the best term to use	4027	B
but i think you know you know unwilling- unwilling you know unwilling- the American workers probably are not willing to do as much work for as little as other country's workers are	4027	B
so do you do a lot of camping	4006	A
oh is that right uh-huh um	4006	A
my sons are in the boy scouts also uh so i know they go a lot of camping but i don't go with them_1	4006	A
but uh we used to live in California and we did a little bit of camping in California not all that much but um enough to get a little flavor for it uh where mostly do you go with your camping	4006	A
oh who am i talking to	4006	A
oh i can't believe that well we can talk about anything well	4006	A
you know this is really funny because i i've tried to make these phone calls um whenever it pops in my head and sometimes they say oh we can't find another party and after they-	4006	A
they say that two times i can't keep hanging on the phone and i just saw that card down there and now i'm really supposed to be baking bread for Cistercian i said oh i'll make another phone call i guess another five dollars helps so anyway	4006	A
oh we have to talk about oh that's right we're on this recording thing well anyway um we used to go camping out in California up by Mendocino and um to um	4006	A
uh Lasson Park which is a volcanic- a volcanic park and uh that was absolutely extraordinary and the rangers there that uh	4006	A
do the tours and the little classes and the lectures and everything were quite extraordinary so that was uh one of our uh major camping times that we enjoyed very very much	4006	A
uh do you ever go camping outside of the boy scouts	4006	A
oh yes	4006	A
uh-huh	4006	A
oh my	4006	A
um-hum um-hum um	4006	A
um-hum	4006	A
oh that's true too	4006	A
uh-huh	4006	A
we took one canoe trip in California now but the boys were very very small when we were out there and um it was a friend of Webbie's that got this group together	4006	A
and uh there had been some rains and therefore the river was a little more swift than what might normally be expected and um	4006	A
i- i i found it exciting but i really thought that it was a trifle dangerous maybe because the currents were kind of bad and we just went ahead anyway but it was the Russian River yeah	4006	A
yeah yeah	4006	A
yeah it can and it did and um it was my first time it was Webbie's first time doing this also and we just trusted- uh trusted in the uh knowledge of	4006	A
this friend that got this party together that it would not be over dangerous and we had our	4006	A
life belts on and everything else like that but we did dump over once and uh you know with small children like that just made me very nervous we didn't go again the next day we just uh kind of uh	4006	A
stayed by camp site and uh cooked but it it was it was very exciting and	4006	A
really very nice and um i wouldn't mind doing something like that again	4006	A
and i guess the first time you do a major endeavor like that you really are a neophyte you don't know exactly what to expect or even sometimes what to do but um	4006	A
it it was quite an experience uh	4006	A
um-hum um-hum yeah yeah so	4006	A
oh yes well Sean is Daniel went last summer so	4006	A
no no no he's not gonna go again this time but uh you're gonna inherit Sean on this trip and uh um-hum	4006	A
i know uh-huh have you been out there before oh you haven't- well Daniel says it's i think it's really quite challenging	4006	A
uh absolutely uh i kind of got the information by drips and drabs from last summer as different friends would talk to him and apparently whoever has to carry that water or part	4006	A
uh well yeah a fair amount mostly with boy scouts	4006	B
well mostly uh well boy scout camps near uh near Dallas uh	4006	B
in- in fact i i think i know your sons Danny and Sean right Jan Novak	4006	B
but we can talk about camping none the less	4006	B
they didn't	4006	B
but we we should talk about camping because_1 they're recording this	4006	B
um-hum	4006	B
well we used to do a lot of camping uh in fact before we had kids Marie and i would go	4006	B
we did a lot of canoe camping uh either in upstate New York where there are a lot of lakes up near Lake Placid and in that area and in Northern Ontario which is also full of lakes	4006	B
and some of our longest trips went for about six days and covered about seventy miles where you you canoe	4006	B
uh from lake to lake sometimes by rivers where they connect or else you have to portage your canoe and all your equipment to the next lake	4006	B
and so that that was a i i think it's a lot in a way easier to go canoe camping because you you don't have to watch the weight so much	4006	B
and it's also cleaner because you can go swimming every day and it's very easy to keep keep cool and keep clean	4006	B
and that's	4006	B
what what river was that yeah i've seen- i've seen the Russian River we never went canoeing on it that that can get pretty fast	4006	B
um-hum	4006	B
um-hum	4006	B
sure sure	4006	B
yeah well you you have to be careful	4006	B
you have to be careful	4006	B
your your guys are going to Philmont are they	4006	B
again-	4006	B
right so Danny's not going again	4006	B
okay well i'll i'm going with them so	4006	B
no	4006	B
really	4006	B
definitely	4036	B
um-hum	4036	B
uh i have twice	4036	B
it was pretty wild experience	4036	B
they were just you know small town cases where uh trailers and banks were involved you know	4036	B
they were civil they weren't they weren't any criminal	4036	B
uh the jury it was uh let me see i think it was ten to one on the jury because_1 they only had to have eleven people	4036	B
so it was they and uh the one changed his vote	4036	B
at the end	4036	B
so it became unanimous you know after they turned it in and then he changed his mind after they turned it in but it then became unanimous so	4036	B
right	4036	B
the the uh other case was just traffic	4036	B
the and you know it was seat belt law and it it didn't even hardly	4036	B
go through so	4036	B
yeah	4036	B
yeah well you learn a lot going to the juries like that though	4036	B
it	4036	B
i wouldn't think that it does	4036	B
i mean from from my experience- from what i experienced in them_1 it didn't you know it didn't	4036	B
didn't turn out the as the way i planned it i mean the way that i would think that it would go it	4036	B
yeah but it was you know it was jury was unorganized and	4036	B
it was it was just wasn't organized enough for me so	4036	B
i'm not used to it not being organized and i just assumed- assumed that it would have been	4036	B
that's	4036	B
that's about what it was	4036	B
yeah they well they picked the one person and then he finally you know moderated everything and made it	4036	B
turn out the way it should have so	4036	B
yeah it ended up working all right	4036	B
yes	4036	B
uh i don't think that they they they educate them_1 enough to	4036	B
to really know what's going on	4036	B
yeah the bank was suing them_1 for uh because they went to get the the trailer	4036	B
that which was assumably their property it was on his property	4036	B
right	4036	B
so they came to get it	4036	B
and then when they came to get it well it- it was on the landlord's property and he wouldn't let them_1 take it off	4036	B
so and they'd already it was a double wide so they'd already taken it apart	4036	B
so they left it there	4036	B
and then when	4036	B
they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it	4036	B
so they were suing him for the money and	4036	B
you know there's no way they could because it's	4036	B
it was the moving company	4036	B
i think that uh one uh advantage	4036	A
of having uh the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't uh convict someone who uh really shouldn't be convicted um	4036	A
and i think that you know a unanimous verdict uh helps to ensure that i guess uh maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who	4036	A
is very unreasonable in some way that uh	4036	A
you uh would have a problem	4036	A
uh you know that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted	4036	A
have you ever served on a jury before	4036	A
oh	4036	A
uh what sorts of cases were they	4036	A
so were they criminal or civil	4036	A
oh okay	4036	A
what uh what was the verdict did the did the jury have trouble reaching a decision	4036	A
yeah	4036	A
so did it become	4036	A
yeah	4036	A
ah	4036	A
oh	4036	A
but since it was a civil case it really didn't matter right you just needed a majority	4036	A
what was what was the other case that was also civil	4036	A
yeah	4036	A
oh didn't really even count	4036	A
yeah i'm i'm a college student so i haven't been you know of a jury eligible age for very long um	4036	A
and uh i did get um one summons actually at one point but i	4036	A
declined it which i'm able to do because i'm a student because it was uh a very bad time	4036	A
yeah i mean i i really i would like to uh to do it at some point um but uh i- i haven't	4036	A
um one one thing that i- i think is um	4036	A
you know maybe is a problem is uh i- i- i think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now but i wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well	4036	A
uh especially sort of	4036	A
ow well	4036	A
the	4036	A
ah but you thought it turned out pretty well	4036	A
yeah	4036	A
oh so it was just kind of a zoo and the jurors just sort of someone had to figure out what was going on	4036	A
hum that's interesting did it did it work out pretty well in the end i mean did a couple of people sort of gradually sort of assume uh sort of a moderator role in the trial or	4036	A
so it worked it did end up working out pretty well	4036	A
the one thing i sometimes wonder about um in civil cases is uh	4036	A
whether especially sort of in uh maybe like product- product liability or medical malpractice where there's um sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes	4036	A
you know it's not just a matter of um of you know did this guy rip off this guy and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract it's sort of a matter of	4036	A
uh you know sometimes getting into very technical issues and i wonder if uh if there's really um	4036	A
if the system works adequately in in educating the jurors about uh whatever um you know issue is under discussion	4036	A
in in the case you were involved in you said it was just sort of a a bank matter of some kind so	4036	A
yeah	4036	A
ah	4036	A
oh so the deal was that he had uh borrowed money from the bank to buy it and he hadn't made the payments	4036	A
yeah	4036	A
ah so they were suing to get it back	4036	A
ah	4036	A
yeah	4036	A
uh	4036	A
well what kind of music do you like to listen to	4043	A
are you	4043	A
oh you like country western	4043	A
yeah	4043	A
um yeah we've i mean it you know there's you have all sorts here too um	4043	A
i went to a pretty uh	4043	A
well the school i went to was Texas A&M an and uh either you either you went country western dancing or uh	4043	A
yeah pretty much- pretty much so so i have- i really liked i liked it there but i also- also like some of the Christian um contemporary music that they have play	4043	A
yeah	4043	A
yeah yeah it's popular here and uh there's all	4043	A
yeah	4043	A
um-hum	4043	A
yeah	4043	A
oh really	4043	A
that's fun	4043	A
well what you you mentioned alternative music	4043	A
what is that	4043	A
oh okay	4043	A
um-hum	4043	A
you said you're also a performer	4043	A
what do you perform	4043	A
do you	4043	A
oh wow	4043	A
yeah	4043	A
um not on a consistent basis at this point i've got three kids and they're preschoolers so i do good to get a book- book read or newspaper read or anything so	4043	A
yeah yeah	4043	A
they do have they do have some good tapes out there for kids we i don't know um	4043	A
Joe Scruggs is a guy that is out of Austin here that has some wonderful kids tapes it's really- i mean they are really fun and uh Joe Scruggs he's with he's an educational	4043	A
um it's called Shadow Play and if you ever see any of his stuff he is just he's really good and and um kids really like it	4043	A
yeah	4043	A
uh-huh	4043	A
oh	4043	A
i don't know i don't know well um have you um they're not they're more uh oh have you ever heard of Riders In The Sky i don't know if they're	4043	A
if they're big up there in fact i think they may have even had a television show on Saturday mornings for kids	4043	A
um	4043	A
they're pretty neat they're kind of a a a blue grass country uh they're real fun i mean they're	4043	A
they're the guys that i mean they can yodel and they can they play the fiddles and the and the saws and stuff and they're real fun they're a real fun group	4043	A
yeah	4043	A
yeah well yeah	4043	A
well we saw them originally at a at a club down here um probably about oh seven or eight years ago and um	4043	A
then just in the last i don't know two years we saw them on a TV show and i think they were i think they were doing kids' music but	4043	A
what we saw in the you know was adult in the but i don't know i don't know where they run the gamut and i don't know um	4043	A
you know i don't know if the south is more towards the you know has more of that crowd or not i don't know i don't know do you-	4043	A
uh-huh	4043	A
well-	4043	A
i'm pretty diverse actually um i consider myself both a performer and also an enjoyer so i kind of get into all all types i run the gamut from uh	4043	B
alternative to uh to rock and roll to heavy metal to you name it so i'm pretty open on that	4043	B
country's not bad i can- i grew up in Nebraska so it was like um yeah i- i listen to it once in a while but it's it's probably not my my top mode i guess that's pretty pretty popular down in Plano though uh	4043	B
oh yeah	4043	B
so you didn't do anything at all right	4043	B
huh	4043	B
uh-huh	4043	B
are you into the Garth Brooks thing at all or is that popular down there right now i know that he's kind of a big name right now	4043	B
yeah	4043	B
and you're also into the Christian contemporary stuff	4043	B
yeah i had a i had a roommate that was really into that he was into all the um	4043	B
groups like uh i'm trying to remember DMZ	4043	B
Resurrection Band uh what else	4043	B
there are a couple of other ones he was into he was into Petra as well	4043	B
in fact it's interesting he he's actually an engineer i don't i- i'm going to school in Florida	4043	B
and he's an engineer that does sound mixing- mixing right now for a Christian bands	4043	B
so yeah he's pretty into it	4043	B
it's been it's been lucrative for him	4043	B
well yeah um kind of like	4043	B
i don't know in the early seventies i think it was called punk rock	4043	B
but then now it's it's kind of taken a different slant and i think it's it's gone more diverse toward	4043	B
um not so much the head banging on the wall stuff as much as just runs	4043	B
really a wider more eclectic uh	4043	B
tone flow and things like that so it's i don't know i like i said i consider myself fairly diverse so um	4043	B
yeah yeah i well i play the trumpet um and also keyboards i played keyboards for about uh oh i don't know twelve thirteen years and played trumpet for about ten so	4043	B
it it's good for a side diversion and a little bit of side income you know whenever i can do you do you play anything at all	4043	B
yeah	4043	B
oh wow	4043	B
sure sure free time is not much of a luxury uh	4043	B
i know that feeling	4043	B
yeah	4043	B
yeah well maybe- hey that may be more quality you know after all	4043	B
yeah	4043	B
Joe Scruggs huh	4043	B
interesting uh	4043	B
when you said Scruggs i was thinking because_1 Earl Scruggs is a real famous banjo player a real famous blue grass player	4043	B
and uh in fact if you remember the the theme from the Beverly Hillbillies	4043	B
he actually played part of that	4043	B
uh he and Lester Flats so uh i was thinking wow wonder if this is a relative	4043	B
but	4043	B
anyway-	4043	B
oh	4043	B
yeah i haven't heard much about that no	4043	B
yeah	4043	B
all right yeah kids probably get into that quite a bit	4043	B
i'm uh i'm not quite at that point in my life yet so	4043	B
it'll probably be a while before i uh before i get into the kids' music in at all so	4043	B
yeah	4043	B
um-hum	4043	B
right	4043	B
um-hum	4043	B
well it's yeah it's hard to tell i know you know like in the Appalachian Mountain area there that thing's real popular yeah i- i've had some friends from West Virginia that's you know that it's real popular around there	4043	B
and-	4043	B
hello Carolyn	4085	B
yes i work for North Carolina State University which has about six or seven thousand employees	4085	B
i'm an associate professor in electrical and computer engineering and computer science	4085	B
and you work for TI	4085	B
and you do	4085	B
um-hum	4085	B
right well i i'm on the benefits committee here one of about twenty people in the university so that's why i checked that topic	4085	B
i swear that's what i was going to say we seem to get more more uh complaints about that than about anything else although you get a good deal of complaints over other kinds of insurance too um	4085	B
yeah health care we have we are on the state health system which is my understanding is that it is a lot worse than the system we had when we had our own just for the university	4085	B
and i wouldn't be real surprised if that's the case um	4085	B
uh yeah they people are uh complaining because the rates for families uh what- you know the the uh	4085	B
uh the additional amount you have to pay to cover a family has gone up quite rapidly	4085	B
uh-huh	4085	B
huh	4085	B
right	4085	B
well	4085	B
do you yeah but i mean do people get to choose whether to take the the preferred preferred provider or not	4085	B
huh	4085	B
right but so so so people would stay in an existing plan that that didn't require you to go to a preferred provider in that case right	4085	B
with the preferred provider	4085	B
huh	4085	B
wonder about the economics of that uh the uh you know twenty years ago when HMO's just got started uh when they started enrolling a lot of people uh it was felt that this would be the way to control health care costs	4085	B
and it worked to some degree but it didn't work that much and the reason was adverse selection the people that go into HMO's are are those that have uh	4085	B
you know that that have generally lesser health needs and i mean it's obvious why that is because the people that that that are already sick are going to see a particular doctor and they don't want to switch just to come in the HMO	4085	B
so you get the people in the H O they they don't uh you know require that much uh care at all and then some how you got less people paying premiums into the into the uh insurance system than you have uh uh	4085	B
you you have almost as many claims so uh that's that's caused a problem uh	4085	B
yes uh i don't think we have a very good cafeteria being a university industry tends to have a lot better programs	4085	B
uh-huh	4085	B
uh-huh	4085	B
right	4085	B
well i i don't know i mean the questions is should should it be the employer that pays for child care uh	4085	B
if if there were a tax credit then everybody would get it regardless who they worked for and you you would also be better in the sense that that people who had only one income in the family would get as much as people who had two and you would sort of think that the people who have one income kind of need it more	4085	B
so	4085	B
oh yes no that that that it's true that's that's important i agree uh yeah that's true and child care is one of the big ones that that gets thrown in um	4085	B
medical care	4085	B
i don't know about that	4085	B
you'd have you'd you'd have your office visits covered but that's only a small part of the total	4085	B
yeah	4085	B
uh well i think you probably would need more denture work wouldn't you now i don't care too much about dental work because of of their dental the dental insurance because i rarely well almost never for the last eight years have i used up enough to	4085	B
uh you know paid enough in in dental bills to uh come up to even the smallest amount you can set aside monthly	4085	B
uh but not everybody is like that and people who have kids that need uh you know an orthodontist services certainly would not be in that situation	4085	B
hi Ed	4085	A
do you uh work for a large organization	4085	A
wow what do you do	4085	A
are you	4085	A
i see	4085	A
yes	4085	A
i'm a computer scientist	4085	A
and always concerned about benefits	4085	A
oh you are	4085	A
i see uh	4085	A
what do you think people's concern is about benefits is it mostly in the area of health care	4085	A
oh yeah	4085	A
yeah	4085	A
well we've our benefits have changed recently to where we have network doctors and network hospitals kind of uh a preferred provider	4085	A
and the you wouldn't believe the complaints	4085	A
because you know you're family doctor may not happen to be in the network	4085	A
and uh so there uh you your benefits are reduced if you don't go to a network doctor	4085	A
that's right	4085	A
that's right you get to choose whether or not you want to change doctors	4085	A
no no the the plan allows you to do either one the benefits that are paid are considerably better	4085	A
when uh	4085	A
we are with the preferred provider yes	4085	A
have you heard about uh cafeteria- the cafeteria plan of benefits	4085	A
well i don't know i i would i'd be interested in seeing- in learning more about that because	4085	A
uh i have no children so i am not interested really in child care benefits except i suppose as a citizen of the world or something	4085	A
yeah	4085	A
yeah i just i i like the concept of being able to choose which benefits are more important to you	4085	A
well you know if you were married to a doctor then you might not need so much	4085	A
yeah i'm sure but	4085	A
uh on the other hand you know maybe maybe if you had false teeth you wouldn't care about dental insurance	4085	A
would you	4085	A
i don't know	4085	A
yeah	4085	A
that's right	4085	A
but that you know people like	4085	A
-hello	4050	B
that's okay i'm Bill from Raleigh	4050	B
oh so another one from	4050	B
a different state besides Texas	4050	B
right	4050	B
uh	4050	B
yes and no it wasn't really a family- a planning one but it was kind of uh it was a birthday and i brought a lot of family together then	4050	B
usually when we have kind of our family reunion it's my grandmother's birthday and	4050	B
and it's all of like she she comes from a big family she has like seven sisters i think	4050	B
and they show up and all their kids and then all- she has uh i have	4050	B
like uh let's see she has four sons and two daughters and	4050	B
they show up and all their kids so it's a pretty big reunion it's about two hundred people maybe	4050	B
um the probably the biggest challenge was uh getting a place where everyone	4050	B
you know could eat comfortably and and everything uh	4050	B
i guess probably the most helpful thing was that uh	4050	B
for the rent uh we rented like a a rescue squad building or something like that and uh	4050	B
each one of the everybody that showed up donated- donated some money for the rent and for	4050	B
for like soft drinks and and so nobody like really got stuck with the bill each person in the family you know brought a dish or some	4050	B
it was kind of potluck you know everybody brought their specialties i guess you would say	4050	B
yeah	4050	B
and of course my grandmother's food was as always gone first because she's such a great cook	4050	B
uh she's eighty six	4050	B
now she does she looks probably like she's in her early sixties	4050	B
and if she didn't have arthritis she'd get around better than me as a matter of fact	4050	B
oh yeah uh my nickname for her is honey woman that's what i call her	4050	B
uh also one thing that's helpful and i don't know if your family's spread out or whatever but most of all my family lives like in the same county so it's just kind of like get on the telephone and	4050	B
it's so and such days from such and such date and everybody just shows up	4050	B
i would say you're spread out then	4050	B
uh my my immediate family you know my my parents and my brothers and sisters i guess we're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever because_1 my dad was in the Army and we were-	4050	B
we were pretty strung out all over but since they've moved back to Carolina's uh we still are the only ones do not live in in Anson County	4050	B
i live in Raleigh and then my my parents live in Greenville and i have one brother and his wife live in Greenville and um another brother that lives in outside of Fayetteville so i mean we're we're	4050	B
we're spread out but everybody else is centralized in in my home town Waynesboro so	4050	B
nobody moves away except us yeah i got out as soon as i graduated	4050	B
just like this town is too small for me good-bye	4050	B
oops hello i pressed the button one so we're recording right now i'm sorry	4050	A
okay and i'm Melanie from Harrisville Utah	4050	A
yeah um okay Bill we're talking about family reunions	4050	A
okay um have you ever had to plan a family reunion	4050	A
oh	4050	A
uh-huh	4050	A
and how did you feel it went	4050	A
oh	4050	A
all of this planning and and getting together and such	4050	A
um	4050	A
oh let's see what else	4050	A
uh-huh	4050	A
oh boy	4050	A
uh-huh	4050	A
oh my word oh well what did you find was most helpful in planning the birthday get together	4050	A
uh-huh	4050	A
oh uh-huh	4050	A
oh	4050	A
oh that's good	4050	A
uh-huh	4050	A
and then did you have a main meal or did everyone just bring it was just potluck uh-huh	4050	A
yeah yeah show off a little bit	4050	A
oh	4050	A
oh now how old is she	4050	A
oh goodness is she pretty spry is she you know pretty	4050	A
oh wow	4050	A
uh-huh	4050	A
oh oh well that's neat that she's in good health and that at that age	4050	A
yeah	4050	A
oh really well that sounds fun well i	4050	A
i had a real challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago and there were we sent out five hundred uh announcements	4050	A
because_1 our family is quite large like your your family there and	4050	A
so that was a real challenge and i was president of our family reunion for two years and	4050	A
i wasn't sure i appreciated that duty for two years in a row but i found that advance planning was the key to success	4050	A
uh-huh	4050	A
oh well that was wonderful though	4050	A
oh	4050	A
oh well that is that is helpful yeah our family ranges from oh goodness	4050	A
well Australia i have a brother lives in Australia to uh Boise Idaho and	4050	A
and uh all kinds of places	4050	A
we are	4050	A
oh	4050	A
in	4050	A
oh	4050	A
uh-huh	4050	A
boy	4050	A
oh my gosh	4050	A
they must really like it there	4050	A
yeah oh	4050	A
oh you're ready to move on to big-	4050	A
okay i guess it took so i guess recording has started now	4038	A
uh	4038	A
i served i was in the Air Force and served on a court martial uh board a couple of times which is very similar to a jury a lot of the same rules apply have you ever served on one	4038	A
uh-huh	4038	A
was it civil or criminal	4038	A
a grand jury or something-	4038	A
uh-huh	4038	A
i see	4038	A
uh-huh	4038	A
uh-huh uh did did the judge uh hand down sentences or did you folks do that	4038	A
uh-huh	4038	A
um	4038	A
no	4038	A
that	4038	A
that's a science in itself	4038	A
uh-huh i see because you'd probably be uh too puritanical and to	4038	A
uh-huh	4038	A
so uh were were the uh sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair or would if you were deciding do you think that they would have been different	4038	A
huh	4038	A
um	4038	A
wow i bet that made him happy	4038	A
right	4038	A
uh-huh	4038	A
yeah	4038	A
oh how many members were on the jury was it a six or twelve member jury	4038	A
uh-huh that's kind of curious to me i didn't realize until the uh Wayne Kennedy Smith trial uh	4038	A
a few months ago that they had six member juries i thought that they you know it was always twelve twelve men tried and true so to speak	4038	A
but uh apparently for some some crimes it's permissible to have six people sit in judgment	4038	A
i know on a getting to this unanimous thing whether you know a jury should be unanimous or not or not in a court martial case it doesn't require the jury to be unanimous it's simple- a simple majority you know rules	4038	A
yeah	4038	A
a probably on capital i don't know we weren't we the two that i were on had to do with drugs	4038	A
and uh we were uh unanimous in acquitting the person even though we in our in our uh gut felt that the individuals were both guilty just because of the friends because of various things	4038	A
the government really failed to prove its case and you know being fair to the person if the government doesn't prove its case no matter how you feel you have to go by what's offered as proof and we had to acquit him in both cases	4038	A
uh yeah it was yeah in some of the critical things like the off special investigations at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person but something happened to the camera and the tape and	4038	A
all they could do was testify about	4038	A
yeah	4038	B
so have you ever served on a jury	4038	B
yeah i finally served on one last year i've um been voting for years and i couldn't figure out why i hadn't been called yet	4038	B
and i finally was so it was an interesting experience i was kind of boring	4038	B
uh it was uh	4038	B
uh it was uh	4038	B
well let's see it was municipal court so it was a combination of uh and i was in the pool for a couple of weeks	4038	B
so it was a combination of criminal and civil and they had uh well most of the time we we spent sitting around in the jury room and getting to know the other potential jurors and then	4038	B
it was always we was exciting when we got called to to to go because then we thought we might be able to do something else besides uh just sit in the jury room	4038	B
uh yeah the judge did uh i uh i had a hard time getting seated on a jury i kept getting uh	4038	B
i'd be questioned uh for impaneling the jury and they kept uh dismissing me	4038	B
course they don't have to give a reason but it's just whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like you know they want to get the best uh mix for their case so they ask all kinds of wild questions	4038	B
yeah well i kept getting called up for drunk driving uh	4038	B
questions and i think part of it was they didn't uh	4038	B
they didn't like the fact that i don't drink any more	4038	B
yeah that was probably it although in my case i might have been more uh sympathetic with the person who got caught i don't know	4038	B
well i was never there never there for any sentencing uh i finally got impaneled on one case uh on my next to the last day and uh we got into the uh jury room to uh	4038	B
decide the case and there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he didn't need to deliberate because he'd already decided that the guy was uh not guilty and he would never vote for guilty	4038	B
so uh they appointed me jury jury foreman and i uh didn't think that uh going in without deliberating	4038	B
allowed us to reach a verdict so i told the judge that uh we weren't were unable- unable to reach a verdict because we couldn't get one member of the jury to deliberate so the whole thing had to be tried over again	4038	B
yeah	4038	B
yeah it was uh it was funny	4038	B
the uh i just- i- i don't know i uh	4038	B
i didn't uh	4038	B
uh i didn't like not being able to deliberate and uh i uh i- i wanted to vote guilty for the guy and the other people were kind of mixed	4038	B
so uh the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again cost him a lot of money i'm sure	4038	B
uh it must have been six	4038	B
yeah	4038	B
um	4038	B
um	4038	B
yeah	4038	B
well let's see is it on uh capital crimes that they have to be unanimous and	4038	B
uh-huh	4038	B
uh too- it was too circumstantial	4038	B
um	4038	B
okay um what does your does your community do anything about recycling	4018	A
um-hum	4018	A
um	4018	A
um-hum	4018	A
right	4018	A
Plano um	4018	A
oh it's probably been i guess i started in September um	4018	A
started where they gave every- every household a bin that you could do newspapers aluminum uh bottles with code one and two on them	4018	A
and uh glass and uh it has been really really successful um	4018	A
they said that they figured like twenty five to thirty percent participation and it's been like forty five percent and um they also do um	4018	A
they pick up on another day of the week for um	4018	A
lawn debris that could go in like a big compost	4018	A
um-hum	4018	A
right	4018	A
right	4018	A
how big is your community	4018	A
yeah	4018	A
um-hum the i yeah that's i- i would like to see the manufacturers really uh	4018	A
you know the only thing that they recycle right now is is plastics one and two and i would like to see them_1 recycle either more	4018	A
plastics um you know up to code seven or eight whatever it is or see the manufacturers using	4018	A
more of the um	4018	A
uh code one and two that i- i mean i don't even know of a place to drop off the other the other ones	4018	A
but um	4018	A
we're recycling newspapers aluminum	4018	A
um i mean like aluminum cans like soup cans and all that not just you know soda pop cans um glass and uh the plastics	4018	A
right	4018	A
i- i took like two garbage sacks full i mean just like paper sacks and got like a quarter and i thought this just really isn't worth my time	4018	A
so	4018	A
that that go through the dregs yeah	4018	A
yeah	4018	A
um-hum	4018	A
um-hum	4018	A
that's great	4018	A
yeah	4018	A
yeah really	4018	A
really	4018	A
we we- i know uh even before this took place um in September	4018	A
the our like our boy scouts were doing paper- you know paper drives and even when i was younger um i remember having paper drives at school and um so	4018	A
i know it it seems like for you know a long time the the Dallas area has been doing some kind of paper recycling i don't know what they did with the papers you know twenty thirty years ago i'm not sure	4018	A
but i know now i mean- we have a lot of um	4018	A
stores Wal-Mart is down real big down here and and their their paper sacks that they do are all you know out of recycled paper and we have a lot of lot of companies-	4018	A
we have been working hard to get a program of recycling going	4018	B
the best we've been able to do is an area that has uh storage bins uh for um bottles and uh plastic	4018	B
but people need to drive it there we don't we haven't moved to having uh picked up with the garbage yet	4018	B
here uh they don't take uh lawn debris to the landfill any more	4018	B
we need to load it into cars and take it to a general site where it gets recycled uh but	4018	B
i think they're they're not making it easy for the uh general public to do it here i mean they they	4018	B
you have to haul everything yourself which can be a mess when it comes to uh yard waste in particular	4018	B
well we've got enough people we've got a community of about eighty five thousand	4018	B
but they're just very reluctant to to get moving the way in which i would like to see them moving	4018	B
um did- did- did you tell me that you're recycling newspapers	4018	B
boy you're you're further ahead here most people are recycling aluminum soda pop and beer cans	4018	B
uh for the money that they get out of them and that seems to be the only incentive on that side	4018	B
yeah it really is but there are a few people who who	4018	B
they will manage it what we've done at the church is to have uh people bring the stuff to our church	4018	B
and then there're couple of people who who crunch them down and then	4018	B
uh take them_1 to a recycling center and then the money is used for uh the outreach program to provide food	4018	B
and so that has been an incentive uh within uh our our particular church	4018	B
but newspapers the city doesn't want and none of the uh recycling	4018	B
places want them because they say that they're it costs them more to recycle than than they get out of them_1 so we're stuck with newspapers	4018	B
yes we have several	4025	B
we do extended families have you do you have you participated in a family reunion	4025	B
um i i know that when we've had ours they set a date and they have them_1 every um year and it's mostly on my mom's side of the family that does it but um	4025	B
they send out invitations and it's the very same weekend of every year and it's in July and they always bring um	4025	B
family history information and they have the Saturday is all tied- um involved in people getting together um going over there's all these tables set up and they've got all this family history that you can get	4025	B
information on different people and their childhood and pictures and put together your own history of your family and your ancestors and that's really fun and then on Sunday they um	4025	B
they have a big dinner and everyone's supposed to bring something and it's more of just a time to just chat and get you know reacquainted with your cousins and	4025	B
and things like that that's the very big extended one that's over two hundred people that go to that	4025	B
so	4025	B
right	4025	B
right	4025	B
i know on more of a smaller scale my husband's mother and father have {boughten} a condominium that's in a ski resort in Utah	4025	B
and um they have it a certain week each year that's set aside for the whole family to come home	4025	B
in July and um everybody tries to go there and stay it's two or three big condominiums that all hook together and so everybody tries to go up and stay and	4025	B
um all be together on his- in his immediate family but there were seven children and by the time you get their spouses and their children all there	4025	B
right	4025	B
uh-huh	4025	B
the money yeah	4025	B
right	4025	B
ever had a family reunion	4025	A
um do you do extended families or	4025	A
yeah	4025	A
yes um in the last couple of years i've the last one we had was in September and um i helped plan it so and it was here in Dallas so um	4025	A
but um	4025	A
uh-huh	4025	A
yeah	4025	A
uh-huh	4025	A
um-hum	4025	A
yeah	4025	A
oh wow yeah that we've done um	4025	A
we went to one that was my husband's grandfather and his brothers and sisters and then their families so we that was kind of nice i don't know that they had done one um in a long long time and so	4025	A
it was real nice to get to to know other people than his just aunts and uncles	4025	A
and so that was really fun and um we did that in Florida but there were still only maybe oh seventy or eighty people there but they did they did a lot of um	4025	A
we had we had several get togethers like Saturday was or Friday night we started with dinner	4025	A
Saturday we had lunch together and took like family pictures and went over family history and then um	4025	A
that night we had some free time in there and then that night was um	4025	A
oh it was more it was a it was a nice dinner and then they had you went around the room and said who you were and maybe something about yourself and	4025	A
you know how you related in the family and stuff and that was kind of nice because we'd been talking to these people all day long and then it was okay now where do you fit in in the in the line and stuff and who's who's are you kind of thing	4025	A
but um	4025	A
um-hum	4025	A
um	4025	A
yeah	4025	A
yeah	4025	A
yeah there're six in my family and i don't i don't think of them_1 as family reunions so much but either- either Thanksgiving or Christmas where for sure	4025	A
but we usually just eat and and play games and you know chitchat but um we had a	4025	A
my grandmother's side of of the family we had a get together last year and that was really fun because	4025	A
uh uh as cousins we stay real close together and um so- but we did things like um	4025	A
went to the tea we went and had tea at the um oh one of the hotels downtown in downtown Dallas and then	4025	A
Friday night if- if you wanted to go you could go to the Mesquite Rodeo	4025	A
and then Saturday it was we had a big family picnic and we had T-shirts that you know said family reunion and had- gave the year and um wore those to the picnic and we had some stuff for the kids and there was a	4025	A
it was there was a wading pool there that if the kids wanted to go swimming they could do that	4025	A
and if the guys wanted to go golf they could do that and stuff and then Saturday night was our big big dinner and and we had it catered and it for most of the part it was catered and	4025	A
it was really nice to be able to send- we sent out stuff this is this is what's available to do and it- it- you know the big family dinner is going to be Saturday night	4025	A
you need to make a reservation and pay us ahead of time because_1 the year before we had done it and uh had had problems getting	4025	A
you know the the yeah i mean it's like pass the hat around and it didn't i don't think they broke even at all and uh which is i mean i can't imagine feeding two hundred like	4025	A
-hello	4001	B
Michael here	4001	B
nice to meet you where are you	4001	B
Lubbock i'm in Biloxi Mississippi	4001	B
yeah not too far away	4001	B
yeah i guess so	4001	B
well um i- i like i don't like real big cars i like fairly sporty smaller cars and uh i have a Toyota Celica right now	4001	B
and um it- uh the the question they asked us was what would we buy next that's that's sort of what i have in mind for the next car that i buy is another Celica	4001	B
um	4001	B
it's an eighty seven	4001	B
oh you have a Celica oh really what what year is yours	4001	B
eighty nine yeah	4001	B
yeah	4001	B
oh i do too	4001	B
i do too yeah i think so too that's is the second Toyota that i've had	4001	B
yeah and um we've had it since it's new and uh that's what i- i plan on getting another one you know whenever the time comes	4001	B
uh-huh uh-huh	4001	B
oh yeah yeah i know	4001	B
uh-huh um-hum	4001	B
what i would really like would be a uh Supra but just can't- just can't afford that that's just a little- out of my range- out of my range	4001	B
yeah	4001	B
um i've heard of it i'm not sure what it's what it is	4001	B
um	4001	B
so a sort of sporty car	4001	B
oh okay um oh other than the Bronco i'm not sure i don't know what it is uh they have a new one other than the Bronco you're talking about huh	4001	B
no i don't know what it is i haven't even really looked at the vehicles much lately	4001	B
oh yeah i think i probably will too because_1 i've had good luck with it never had hardly any problems	4001	B
you know and the one i had before was the same way	4001	B
yeah we had a a uh Tercel before this an eight two Tercel	4001	B
and that thing never gave us any problems	4001	B
we had a wreck with it and uh the only problems we had was because of the wreck you know front end alignment problems and stuff like that	4001	B
but um uh i will i will say this uh the the Celica that i own now i have replaced the clutch in it	4001	B
yeah and that was last year but um i think so i think you just wear them_1 out because_1 we live you know our area's fairly congested and a lot of traffic so it's	4001	B
you know we use the clutch a lot i do you're stopping and going a lot you know	4001	B
oh yeah	4001	B
yeah and uh i don't i'm i'm you know i don't worry about getting a Japanese car you know everybody's talking about buying American and everything and	4001	B
uh i just like the Japanese cars i think i think they're better made	4001	B
that's right yeah	4001	B
yeah if they could make one as cheap you know too i- i got- i think the American cars they have the Japanese beat when it comes to big cars of course	4001	B
but uh when it comes to little uh sporty cars or that- that kind of a car i- i don't think there there's any competition really i think the Japanese have them_1 beat	4001	B
oh yeah sure i do too	4001	B
um-hum	4001	B
well i can too i'm um	4001	B
i fill up maybe well i fill up about once every week and a half i'd guess- i'd say	4001	B
you know and uh i do a lot of driving right now i'm in school and everything so	4001	B
um been doing a lot of extra driving but it's you know it's not bad not at all	4001	B
well-	4001	B
that's right that's right	4001	B
well uh is yours the Celica that you have is it a um an ST or a GT or what	4001	B
GT mine is an ST	4001	B
uh it's little lower model than the GT	4001	B
yeah they had the ST the GT and the GTS you know and the the ST is the uh cheaper version of all three of them_1 yeah	4001	B
uh-huh uh-huh	4001	B
yeah that's got a little little power more powerful engine and a lot more uh little more options on it so	4001	B
yeah	4001	B
oh yeah well that's the way mothers are	4001	B
i'm Bridgette	4001	A
nice to meet you	4001	A
i'm in Lubbock Texas	4001	A
oh really oh my gosh	4001	A
i know well are you ready for me to push one okay	4001	A
okay so what kind of cars do you like	4001	A
uh-huh	4001	A
uh-huh	4001	A
uh-huh	4001	A
what year is it	4001	A
okay_1 is it because_1 that's what i have too	4001	A
uh-huh i love it i have a eighty nine	4001	A
yeah it's a Celica convertible and i love it Toyota makes great cars	4001	A
really	4001	A
do you	4001	A
yeah my fiance and i we've talked about it even and he has a um	4001	A
a BMW and they are so- expensive to just keep up and stuff	4001	A
that we were both like you know if we're gonna get a new car it'd probably i would say it would be a Toyota too	4001	A
for sure	4001	A
uh-huh	4001	A
yeah i know	4001	A
those are nice i think the next car that we'll look into will be more of a i don't know i think is it Toyota 4-Runner	4001	A
is that what they're called something like like a or like a um	4001	A
what are they called the one that the one that Ford makes	4001	A
the new ones do you know what i'm talking about	4001	A
no they're kind of more like a truck like a Bronco	4001	A
type of	4001	A
yeah	4001	A
yeah	4001	A
yeah i haven't either	4001	A
but i- i would think it would most likely be Toyota	4001	A
uh-huh	4001	A
yeah me neither	4001	A
really	4001	A
uh-huh	4001	A
um-hum	4001	A
really	4001	A
uh-huh	4001	A
really	4001	A
but that's understandable	4001	A
yeah	4001	A
yeah	4001	A
uh-huh i would definitely have to say Toyota though that's the best car i've had	4001	A
it's the best built	4001	A
yeah i know	4001	A
i know uh i feel like	4001	A
i know i do too i feel like if if like Ford or someone could make one that competed with you know i would buy it i would	4001	A
yeah yeah	4001	A
yeah	4001	A
yeah i think there's so much more {economicable} too just like with gas and everything i mean i can go forever on a tank of gas	4001	A
it's like	4001	A
yeah	4001	A
uh-huh	4001	A
go a far way on that tank of gas i know	4001	A
it's a GT	4001	A
what is that	4001	A
is it	4001	A
um-hum	4001	A
really my mom has a a GTS	4001	A
she has a eighty nine GTS Celica	4001	A
yeah	4001	A
yeah she i know she has this big powerful engine on she doesn't drive i mean she doesn't drive over forty	4001	A
i know and the funny thing is because she bought it and i don't think the guy really i don't think she realized everything with the insurance and stuff on	4001	A
so do you have kids in the public school system	4084	A
oh yeah well i've got preschoolers so we have one that is going to be starting kindergarten next year and uh	4084	A
i don't know if i'm real comfortable with the public schools at this point but um	4084	A
home schooling right now is not an option for us so	4084	A
and private- and private schools um i don't know yeah so you have to deal with it what- what you have but um	4084	A
um	4084	A
i don't know i'm what do you think about the school systems	4084	A
yeah	4084	A
yeah	4084	A
yeah they're i feel like they're trying to teach a lot of um	4084	A
they're taking the role of the parent and trying to teach a lot of uh of values and doing a lot of baby sitting and and not getting down to what they need to be teaching	4084	A
and um yeah there's a lot of things that i i wanna teach my kids and i don't want them to mess around with	4084	A
um	4084	A
you know i don't feel like that's their that's their place um one of the things that uh my husband works for uh for a company that	4084	A
well- well he works for Frito-Lay but they had a a guy come in um talking about some of the new IBM	4084	A
um systems that they have coming out and talking about how school systems are just are not transitioning as as rapidly as um	4084	A
as a lot well industry- industry right now is is just gonna have to uh you know well in a transition period with the computers and stuff and um that was real encouraging as i we- we went and looked at the	4084	A
the kindergarten class that my little boy will go into	4084	A
and they have reading to write which is uh they can write stories and and learn to write on computers so at least uh the school district that we're in has you know computers that they begin on and i really feel like	4084	A
um they're going to have to use those a lot and and that way a child that my son already know already knows how to read and he will be able to excel at his own pace where the kids that you know	4084	A
that don't have	4084	A
you know that haven't had the he has a real desire to learn and hopefully he will be challenged throughout	4084	A
you know his school life if he's of uh you know that things are available to him like the computer that he can	4084	A
go off and and teach himself yeah because_1 i know there's a lot of a lot of junk that i learned in school and it's been it's been a number of years since i've been in high school and college and um	4084	A
they uh you know some of the stuff i learned it was such a such a waste of time	4084	A
and um	4084	A
i come back and	4084	A
uh you really have to work with um what's out there in the environment and use it to your advantage in the schools right now it's just they're just beginning i think to	4084	A
to take advantage of the computers and and of course not all schools are able to do that because of the expense of them but um	4084	A
yeah	4084	A
um-hum	4084	A
uh no i don't i'm a college student actually no kids yet	4084	B
uh-huh	4084	B
right	4084	B
uh-huh	4084	B
pretty expensive	4084	B
right	4084	B
uh	4084	B
i think there's a lot that could be done to improve them_1 i uh	4084	B
being that i'm in college and stuff you get to college and you see you know it just seems- it seems like	4084	B
that we ought to be doing a lot of the things that are- that are done in college i guess should be taught a lot earlier in school like in math and science and stuff like that	4084	B
i mean i'm a math major and when i was in high school you know i i think i could of handled a lot of the work that i've been doing here in college at a much younger age	4084	B
and i believe that that's the way that it used to be in this country a long time ago and that it probably is in a lot of other countries too because your	4084	B
your math professors or whatever- whatever will always go yeah i was doing this stuff back in high school and you're like well you know then why the heck is it you know my third year in college and i'm just now getting to it	4084	B
it just seems like that they've	4084	B
the curriculum in the public schools is just too soft or something	4084	B
right	4084	B
right	4084	B
uh-huh	4084	B
uh-huh	4084	B
right	4084	B
right	4084	B
right	4084	B
work at his own pace	4084	B
right	4084	B
uh-huh	4084	B
right	4084	B
right	4084	B
well i agree very highly with your point about the the uh public schools have gotten away from the real sort of	4084	B
hard core curriculum and into areas that are more should be dealt with at home or in the Church or somewhere else	4084	B
dealing with value judgements and dealing with how you how you interact with the rest of society because i feel that those are really things that that have no place in the school i mean i- i see that they're they're trying to uh	4084	B
uh i don't know what they are trying to do but i really think that the emphasis should be more on on book learning and not	4084	B
on okay you know here's our civics class this is we're going to talk about how people deal with each other in their community and how it's suppose to be and	4084	B
as opposed to just having straight up math reading writing	4084	B
i agree i think taxes are high	4071	B
um yes uh-huh	4071	B
oh	4071	B
uh-huh	4071	B
oh	4071	B
right	4071	B
yeah i agree- i agree i think this is about time of the year where you you just start getting	4071	B
um well if you do get money back from like jobs like i'm still a student so um i only work part time so i- i get a check back	4071	B
from from taxes but	4071	B
so	4071	B
no	4071	B
yeah	4071	B
yeah	4071	B
yeah there you go	4071	B
right	4071	B
yeah i don't know i don't doesn't seem like they're doing much with it neither i mean there's plans there and now with the voting and and people you know getting into senate and government and stuff i mean- they have nice plans and	4071	B
um but they don't always work and then you know they try to raise taxes more and i don't what happens with all the money because if their plans don't work you know and the taxes get raised	4071	B
i don't know i'm not you know really into politics i don't- really understand it but	4071	B
it's just	4071	B
you know	4071	B
right	4071	B
um-hum	4071	B
hm	4071	B
right huh	4071	B
yeah that could be nice	4071	B
huh	4071	B
right	4071	B
yeah	4071	B
right	4071	B
hm	4071	B
yeah it isn't there's not much out there that's fair that's for sure	4071	B
huh i'll agree to that	4071	B
um	4071	B
um no i i have no idea i just	4071	B
i use	4071	B
um-hum	4071	B
yeah-	4071	B
well Jackie uh on taxes i i'd guess i'd have to say that i my opinion is that i'd do think that Americans are paying too much in taxes uh what's your feeling about that	4071	A
right	4071	A
uh	4071	A
where you live do you- you have a state income tax and a sales tax both	4071	A
uh uh-huh	4071	A
yeah in New Hampshire we have uh uh no no what we call broad base taxes no income tax and no sales tax	4071	A
uh we tax business uh eight percent businesses are taxed eight percent	4071	A
and we have uh what we call the five B's uh for our taxes	4071	A
booze uh butts cigarettes beds uh hotel room tax bellies a meal tax and bets uh gambling	4071	A
so uh we do have a very low tax rate but you know combined with the federal income tax i think that Americans uh generally do pay in too too much in taxes	4071	A
uh-huh	4071	A
well that's nice	4071	A
nice to- nice to get a refund	4071	A
uh-huh do you think that uh for whatever taxes we do pay that uh we're getting value for it	4071	A
yeah	4071	A
uh my my opinion of taxes is that when you send money to Washington or to the state and they say they're going to send some back it's like giving yourself a transfusion- it's like one arm giving the other a transfusion	4071	A
you know what i mean	4071	A
uh it it really uh i should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube because	4071	A
right because uh yeah- there's an old saying in in amongst taxes and politicians that uh there's a fly paper effect and that is that money tends to stick where it lands first	4071	A
and when you send it to Washington or send it to your state capitol uh a lot of it stays there and uh not that much comes back to you	4071	A
um-hum	4071	A
that's it	4071	A
um-hum	4071	A
well it does it it it it does seem that uh the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend	4071	A
uh it's almost like they'll spend as much as the they were were they're allowed to collect you know	4071	A
um i there's an interesting proposal that's been uh going around now for a few years of having a flat tax	4071	A
uh ten percent or thirteen percent there would be no figuring i mean you would take your income tax you'd have a certain amount- i mean you you take your total salary	4071	A
uh those who made under a certain amount wouldn't have- owe any taxes and then there'd be a set amount for however many people you know dependents you had	4071	A
and you would just pay a flat tax no exemptions no deductions or anything else after you- you know after you uh figure out you know who's in your family	4071	A
and that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the IRS and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with you know	4071	A
yeah	4071	A
i i'd like to see something like that yeah i think it would be fairer and uh it would put a lot- you know a lot of the tax attorneys out of business and i'm sure they'll fight it tooth and nail but	4071	A
i really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all Americans	4071	A
i mean it doesn't seem right that somebody that makes twenty five or thirty thousand dollars pays four five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes uh two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes	4071	A
doesn't seem fair to me	4071	A
right	4071	A
right i think your taxes in Wisconsin are pretty high i- i- if i'm not mistaken aren't they	4071	A
i mean for your state what is do you know what your state income tax rate is	4071	A
twenty percent	4071	A
just	4071	A
you just pay it huh	4071	A
you're like you're like my daughter who's in in college down in Massachusetts and uh she works as a waitress and she's attending college full time also and she sends her taxes to me and i figure them out she really has no idea she gets a refund check and	4071	A
nah not really my parents are still pretty young my father's forty five mother about the same age	4046	B
yeah um	4046	B
so that really hasn't been an issue for me	4046	B
how about_1 yourself	4046	B
um-hum	4046	B
um-hum	4046	B
right have they got any kind of uh supplemental insurance for that or	4046	B
um-hum	4046	B
yeah well i've heard about most of that insurance i was wondering because it seems like what i've heard is usually that the stuff says uh kind of thing where they cancel you a couple of years after you get in into the home	4046	B
so it tends to be kind of useless anyway	4046	B
um-hum	4046	B
right	4046	B
yeah	4046	B
um-hum	4046	B
yeah	4046	B
right	4046	B
yeah	4046	B
i don't know it seems to me that for the kind of money a nursing home typically costs you can maybe even afford to	4046	B
to have a nurse come into the home periodically	4046	B
yeah	4046	B
dollars a year at that point yeah it seems like you could hire somebody part time	4046	B
yeah	4046	B
and certainly more dignified than uh	4046	B
than warehousing them	4046	B
right	4046	B
yeah	4046	B
it's it's kind of scary because it seems like uh you know a lot of people you know it's it's uh the budgets of these places has gotten so tight	4046	B
and uh you know they just really can't take care of them_1 very well the budget and staffing especially if it's a state run	4046	B
um-hum	4046	B
yeah it seems like every time i see something on television it's not good	4046	B
yeah	4046	B
yeah	4046	B
yeah it seems that way	4046	B
yeah i sure do they're they're pretty healthy everybody in my family seems to die when they're they're in good health but they get to be like seventy or eighty and all have aneurisms just drop dead	4046	B
yeah i think you know that's pretty good way to go	4046	B
i'd be happy	4046	B
yeah that's- that's the worst part um seems to me that a lot of times people wind up in nursing homes who tend to survive major things like strokes or uh	4046	B
heart attacks that sort of thing and then you know they can't really help themselves so they have to be cared for	4046	B
right	4046	B
yeah i mean it seems like they'd be almost just you know better off just withholding care to some some degree	4046	B
yeah	4046	B
yeah	4046	B
well it seems to me it's a little bit easier with the elderly because you know at least they've lived a life	4046	B
and uh	4046	B
yeah	4046	B
yeah it's something it's something like fifty percent or greater of all health care expenses are in the last five years of life	4046	B
so	4046	B
uh-huh	4046	B
right	4046	B
um-hum	4046	B
right	4046	B
yeah	4046	B
seems like uh unfortunately that many of those people who are put through those if they'd uh let their wishes be known ahead of time frequently they wouldn't have been interested in heroic measures and	4046	B
if that's the case then	4046	B
um-hum	4046	B
yeah well i don't know my wife's a medical student and uh you know we got some of the uh Journal of the AMA and American Medical News thing and it seems like that physicians unless they're in writing or video tape or something	4046	B
that they're kind of in a	4046	B
so have you had to think about uh	4046	A
nursing homes and the elderly that sort of thing in your own life	4046	A
uh-huh	4046	A
oh that's very young	4046	A
uh-huh	4046	A
uh no my parents are getting older my father is uh	4046	A
seventy and my mother must be about sixty five	4046	A
so i'm starting to think about it but i haven't had to do anything about it yet uh my grand	4046	A
no i'm pretty sure they don't um they have some income from pensions and social security um	4046	A
but no i don't think they have any insurance that would cover that sort of thing	4046	A
yeah its my impression those costs are so high that without something	4046	A
you know special you can't handle it anyway uh	4046	A
i mean i think we might uh we talk about having them move in with us	4046	A
but there are certain health	4046	A
you know certain health conditions that we wouldn't be able to handle and i think we've just sort of avoided thinking about it real hard	4046	A
that might be a good alternative i mean it is my impressions tens of thousands of dollars	4046	A
yeah	4046	A
yeah what the heck	4046	A
yeah	4046	A
yeah its	4046	A
it it it does seem like there are a lot of horror stories out there and	4046	A
uh	4046	A
yeah	4046	A
yeah	4046	A
i saw something on Sixty- Sixty Minutes a few months ago about nursing homes in Texas that was a real you know horror piece	4046	A
yeah so and i guess you know we have to think about gee maybe we have another forty years before we'd end up in that sort of situation is it possible we could	4046	A
put away enough money to handle it ourselves	4046	A
huh um do you do you have grandparents who are left	4046	A
well that's could be worse i think	4046	A
if i could live until seventy or eighty and have an aneurism and drop dead i'd probably	4046	A
yeah i- i think that might be sufficient- might be sufficient	4046	A
um-hum	4046	A
yeah i mean it seems like in a case like that you'd need more help than ever to uh	4046	A
to more more support and some way to live a fulfilling life and it doesn't seem like those people are getting it	4046	A
well it's always a tough question you know i mean with not only the elderly but sick people in general you know when do you withhold and when do you not	4046	A
you would think yeah i mean you'd think hey the clock's bound to run out at some point	4046	A
yeah um you my wife is a nurse and she tells me stories about uh	4046	A
the things that people are put through the so heroic measures they're put through when they're very sick some of them are very old and some aren't that uh	4046	A
everyone really knows isn't going to make a real difference but they're sort of left not knowing what else to do than everything they can do	4046	A
yeah my wife has certain- certain wishes that she doesn't want certain procedures done and i just hope i can remember what they are it comes time to deal with it	4046	A
uh-huh	4046	A
um-hum	4046	A
um-hum	4046	A
i'm Bridget	4015	A
yes	4015	A
what are you doing	4015	A
i'm just sitting here trying to	4015	A
eat bread before i go to a meeting	4015	A
no i'm in Lubbock	4015	A
yeah what are you doing are you at the office	4015	A
where are you	4015	A
are you	4015	A
cool	4015	A
i know like listen to us we're like trying to volunteer	4015	A
okay are you ready for me to push one	4015	A
do we know what we're going to say	4015	A
yeah okay i'll push one	4015	A
okay so what do you think about crime in the big D	4015	A
are you	4015	A
um-hum	4015	A
i don't know i think in Dallas it's a lot more scary just because_1 it's a big city i mean in Lubbock and stuff i know lots of people that don't lock their doors or you know leave their windows open at night because it's so much smaller i mean it feels safer	4015	A
and i know that it happens here but it's not near like it is in Dallas	4015	A
people are more trustworthy i think	4015	A
people have reason to be i guess	4015	A
yeah	4015	A
i know lots of people that'll leave their doors open you know if you have to go get something like	4015	A
get a book or something from their house you can just walk right in	4015	A
they're always unlocked or something and	4015	A
i mean	4015	A
see i know and there're only like certain	4015	A
you know neighborhoods up in Lubbock that are that you wouldn't leave your doors unlocked- you know	4015	A
but besides that i don't know it's fairly safe i think	4015	A
really	4015	A
yeah	4015	A
yeah	4015	A
Dallas can be pretty bad though	4015	A
i think it depend on the city really	4015	A
i don't know though because i think that way of Lubbock and then uh	4015	A
like i was talking to this girl that lives way out in the country and she was saying how bad it is out there and i would think it would be less	4015	A
i would thinking it wouldn't be as bad	4015	A
see i know i know that's scary	4015	A
i don't know though but i still think like out in the country when she said that i was like what	4015	A
i was like no way and she goes yeah she goes you know people get broken into a lot because they you know it's real easy to get away with there you know no one can see them carrying out the stuff if no one lives nearby	4015	A
i was like well that's true but besides that	4015	A
i don't know and i think it's just getting worse	4015	A
uh-huh	4015	A
i know	4015	A
see i know	4015	A
yeah that's true	4015	A
because_1 you have neighbors and stuff at least you know	4015	A
i know someone's got to	4015	A
i know that's scary though	4015	A
and it just keeps rising	4015	A
i mean i can't imagine	4015	A
i don't know what's after i've been here so long it's like i well you'd have to pay me to move back to Dallas	4015	A
i mean i don't like now- now that	4015	A
i'm away from it and i can look back at how you know Dallas is and stuff yeah i don't like it	4015	A
i don't like it at all really	4015	A
i don't know i think it'd depend on	4015	A
i don't know where you live i know that's not right though i think that but i don't think that's really	4015	A
yeah	4015	A
yeah	4015	A
really see that's sad i would think like car theft is a really big thing	4015	A
wouldn't you	4015	A
i think that or	4015	A
i know i know	4015	A
see i know	4015	A
i don't know because_1 that's	4015	A
i think car- i don't know if that is though that's what that'd be my guess car theft for sure	4015	A
i don't know besides people that would be just have like kids that come in and burglarize and take like TVs and stuff that they could sell real easy whereas someone like cleaning you out you know	4015	A
i guess that would depend on it too	4015	A
uh-huh	4015	A
no way	4015	A
oh my gosh	4015	A
i'm Melissa- Melissa Brigette Moore	4015	B
nothing	4015	B
are you in Dallas or Lubbock	4015	B
oh are you	4015	B
how funny huh	4015	B
i'm at home	4015	B
yeah	4015	B
yeah	4015	B
about crime	4015	B
okay	4015	B
well	4015	B
i'm worried about my car because_1 i just got a new car and	4015	B
so i'm worried about it	4015	B
getting stolen or anything happening to it at all	4015	B
so	4015	B
yeah	4015	B
yeah	4015	B
yeah	4015	B
yeah	4015	B
i don't know i don't it doesn't matter where i go i lock my doors	4015	B
so	4015	B
gee i don't think i'd ever do that if i wasn't at home	4015	B
yeah	4015	B
God even up in like Highland Park i don't even think i'd leave it open seems like that'd where they'd really go for the big houses	4015	B
hum	4015	B
yeah	4015	B
yeah	4015	B
uh-huh	4015	B
yeah	4015	B
yeah	4015	B
i guess it just depends because_1 there're certain part of the cities too there's no way i would ever i wouldn't even leave my car alone in south Dallas	4015	B
um	4015	B
yeah	4015	B
yeah	4015	B
yeah	4015	B
that's what scares me about living out in uh like off in the country i used to live out in the country	4015	B
and that kind of scares me because i think	4015	B
you know you always hear about all those murders and it's weird to think about but it happens and that's the scary part	4015	B
and i don't like living out in the country i like living in the city where i'm close to there might be more crime or as they say but it just makes me feel safer because i'm around someone	4015	B
yeah if i scream someone's going to hear me	4015	B
yeah	4015	B
yeah	4015	B
yeah	4015	B
yeah	4015	B
yeah	4015	B
hum	4015	B
yeah	4015	B
i don't know i guess i'm sure there is	4015	B
a bunch of thieving- of thieving going on in Lubbock it's just not around you or not that you know of	4015	B
because_1 i don't know i mean uh a couple of summers ago the people behind us got robbed	4015	B
and	4015	B
you know we were everybody was looking out but ever since like a week after that nobody just even paid any attention any more	4015	B
yeah	4015	B
yeah	4015	B
yeah	4015	B
yeah	4015	B
especially here where we have so many cars	4015	B
everybody in New York takes a cab and we've all got cars	4015	B
yeah	4015	B
yeah	4015	B
yeah a friend of mine's house he was gone all summer but he has a house here by himself	4015	B
and um his own friends got in and robbed him	4015	B
yeah he has this he has this like gorgeous bedroom set and that's the-	4015	B
this recycling it's uh i don't know what you all are doing but we are not doing a whole lot here in Arlington about it uh they have a trial section that uh	4075	A
part of the city has been given these uh plastic garbage cans where you are suppose to separate and put it out	4075	A
i don't happen to be in the part of the city that does that though	4075	A
uh-huh	4075	A
uh-huh	4075	A
uh-huh	4075	A
yes	4075	A
uh-huh	4075	A
uh-huh	4075	A
uh-huh	4075	A
oh that's interesting- the grocery stores here have usually have some bins for the plastic bag recycling and some of the plastic jugs and bottle type things	4075	A
uh-huh	4075	A
we don't have very uh i do not know of a very good place for glass here	4075	A
but i don't i would not know where to take glass	4075	A
oh yes they'll recycle those we have places for those and uh for a while they were the newspapers there were places but i think they had so many newspapers now they are kind of discouraging us from taking them any place	4075	A
um-hum	4075	A
yes i know and we have that problem but uh	4075	A
uh-huh	4075	A
i see	4075	A
uh-huh	4075	A
hum	4075	A
yes	4075	A
oh that's a good idea	4075	A
oh	4075	A
but do you all have any place around there for uh used oil car oil	4075	A
uh-huh	4075	A
uh-huh	4075	A
huh	4075	A
right uh-huh uh-huh	4075	A
my goodness	4075	A
huh well we do ours ourself and we take it to a uh	4075	A
so	4075	B
right	4075	B
right here in Philadelphia the	4075	B
city for residential customers has certain they had a trial section that was having curb side recycling with special containers	4075	B
and then they decided to go ahead and phase it in piece by piece so every year a different piece of the city gets added to the list	4075	B
but in my neighborhood they have had voluntary recycling for several years now	4075	B
you on the first and third Saturdays of every month you take your	4075	B
bottles and your newspapers and lets see bottles newspapers to certain corners in the neighborhood	4075	B
and there is a farmer's market that collects the plastic they uh	4075	B
it use to be a firehouse	4075	B
but they're trying to get some urban renewal going in here and trying to make the area safer i live near the University of Pennsylvania where i'm a grad student	4075	B
and it's not the safest neighborhood there is	4075	B
so they are trying to get urban renewal going and they one of the things that this farmer's market does is collect plastic	4075	B
and they use that money to keep up the building and organize events and that kind of thing	4075	B
right they have that for the plastic bags here too yeah let's see and the	4075	B
um	4075	B
uh-huh how about aluminum cans do they recycle that	4075	B
right well the only part the thing is that it's probably isn't profitable to just from um a standpoint of making new paper to recycle	4075	B
but where you end up having a savings is at your landfill last so much longer	4075	B
down home i know my folks	4075	B
um	4075	B
live in South Carolina and they have had some landfill filling up problems and they county built a new landfill and a site that wasn't geologically proper	4075	B
so that the landfill consideration is a good reason that probably communities are still going to end up paying to have the paper taken away but they'll just won't have to build landfills as often	4075	B
another things that they are doing not at home but in the offices here is recycling of paper and	4075	B
that is done by separating the white paper which is i guess is a higher quality	4075	B
from the miscellaneous paper	4075	B
and well they also recycle aluminum cans	4075	B
they have every office has two little cardboard boxes for putting in the white paper and the mixed paper	4075	B
and big trash cans down at the ends of the hallways that when they get filled up you can go take them down the hall	4075	B
oh you know that's one thing that kind of bothered me i now when i i use to get my oil- my oil changed when i go down to South Carolina there has been a Goodyear tire store that has been servicing my car for a number of years	4075	B
and they have pretty economical rates but now in South Carolina there is this	4075	B
mandatory waste recycling fee and my daddy would- would like to to get the used oil to pour over fence posts	4075	B
so you know to make the fence posts last longer and weather better but the oil the the uh Goodyear store won't even	4075	B
they say they can't give you the oil they say it's against the federal law now	4075	B
and that they have to charge the waste recycling fee	4075	B
so the only way you can get in South Carolina anyway and they say it's because of federal law but you can get your used oil back is to do it yourself	4075	B
course i don't like talking about budgets no not my favorite subject	4039	A
um-hum	4039	A
uh-huh so you pretty much keep pretty close to your budget	4039	A
yeah	4039	A
boy	4039	A
well we bought a house about a year and a half ago but i- i can't say that i'm as uh	4039	A
good as- as you are about our budget because i mean i'm in charge of paying the bills but uh you know i put a little bit in the savings first and then after that i'll you know pay on everything as i can and	4039	A
and that's i- i don't have a budget other than that i know i need to and i know we probably will in the future but as of yet we're just still trying to you know get on on where we wanna be financially and then	4039	A
maybe we can um you know work more on	4039	A
you know they have all these financial plans and how much money you have saved and where you wanna put it and everything well we're still- we're still trying to save a little bit	4039	A
yeah well yeah exactly	4039	A
yeah	4039	A
exactly and see we've got two used cars and you know when you have used cars there's always something you're fixing on them	4039	A
you may not have a car payment but you know you have those regular maintenance things i mean like-	4039	A
yeah yeah but i'm gonna be out of a job in September	4039	A
yeah	4039	A
oh i work for a liquor uh distiller	4039	A
yeah and they're moving their offices up- offices up to Connecticut	4039	A
so i'll be staying down here but i'm not real worried about it so but it's something else that you know we have to be considering in our budget	4039	A
and trying to take care of everything you know all the um outstanding debt that we have and kind of getting ready for it	4039	A
it it's the worst thing because_1 when i got out of college you know that was our mistake when we got married you know we didn't have much so we kind of charged it up and now we're you know paying for it	4039	A
um-hum	4039	A
but she's not working now	4039	A
do y'all have a family	4039	A
oh well we don't have a family either besides a couple dogs and a cat	4039	A
yeah well i wanna try to um	4039	A
go back to school get a degree that that you know i something i'll enjoy doing a little bit more	4039	A
so you know um	4039	A
i'll	4039	A
i'm sorry my husband he works in banking he's in finances and economics	4039	A
he's kind of like a loan servicer accountant right now but he's trying to trying to switch over into international trade because you know with the free trade agreements going on here there's really gonna be a lot of opportunity	4039	A
so we hope anyways and what do you do	4039	A
oh automotive safety bags is that like air bags	4039	A
-another term well i guess i covered all the budgeting that i wanted to	4039	A
no you don't you you can stop at anytime you're you're finished i mean i've never i've been doing this for a while now and i've they've never not paid me so	4039	A
yeah it was nice talking to you	4039	A
bye-bye	4039	A
oh you don't	4039	B
this is my first one we just bought a house about three months ago and so we had to go on one and um what i do is um just	4039	B
divide up my paycheck and put it in each category i put it in my day planner	4039	B
and i have a certain amount on each column like under groceries or electricity	4039	B
and i put so much in each one and then just subtract of	4039	B
just spend what the amount in each column what we're allotted	4039	B
yeah if not we're up a creek	4039	B
uh-huh	4039	B
uh-huh	4039	B
yeah that's tough we have an emergency fund that we keep and that was tough to get we try to not touch that we've gone to the house but sometimes you dip into it	4039	B
oh yeah	4039	B
uh-huh do both of you work your husband	4039	B
oh you are	4039	B
where do you work at	4039	B
liquor distiller	4039	B
oh wow	4039	B
um-hum	4039	B
yeah	4039	B
yeah that's a thing we try to stay out of is debt um	4039	B
it it's hard though when you first get married you want things to live on because_1 i just got married what two and a half years ago	4039	B
and we tried not to do that my wife worked at the time so we bought most no	4039	B
um no it's just me and her right now	4039	B
we have one dog but it's good well- she's- looking for part-time work just to try off to pay off her car	4039	B
oh	4039	B
uh-huh	4039	B
what's your husband do	4039	B
uh-huh	4039	B
that's true	4039	B

kids	4095	A
are you are you married	4095	A
are you	4095	A
well um do you know what we're um to talk about is is families and stuff like that and um how how you	4095	A
how you spend time with you're family and stuff uh i've got three kids	4095	A
yeah so and i stay home with them_1 so it's um	4095	A
i spend a lot of time with my kids i really enjoy it i uh	4095	A
i've uh i i was in college for you know four years and and worked for a number of years and and now we've got three preschoolers so i spend a lot of time with them and yeah	4095	A
um i've got a six month old a uh two and a half almost three year old going on thirty and then a uh four and a half year old almost five year old so i've got a couple a couple of little ones but um	4095	A
i i spend a lot of time with my kids um yeah it's	4095	A
uh i i really am glad that that i'm able to stay home with them and stuff so it's real fun but well um do you uh	4095	A
hum oh okay well how would you spend time with your kids if you were if you had kids or or uh do you do you do any babysitting do you did you use to when you were in uh high school or anything	4095	A
so what'd you do with them did you i mean of course you were paid to uh to spend time with them and stuff but what did you do to uh entertain them and keep them entertained were they older kids or school age	4095	A
yeah	4095	A
yeah	4095	A
yeah yeah	4095	A
yeah we my kids well my kids are	4095	A
of course now that it's getting warmer much more outdoors than than indoors but	4095	A
i spend a lot of time i spend a lot of time with them reading and we play games and stuff but	4095	A
yeah but it's it's it's neat cause they're really they're they're well behaved kids and they're and they	4095	A
they interact pretty well with adults they're shy at times but they interact pretty well with adults and	4095	A
uh i have my oldest goes to preschool two days a week and my my little girl goes one day one of the same days so um	4095	A
yeah and then my little boy will start kindergarten next year so we went and checked out the school last- last week in fact they had an open house and stuff so	4095	A
yeah that's an adventure i think it's gonna be harder on mom than it's than it is on him but yeah it's like oh i can't send my baby to school it's just yeah it's like i can't believe i you know he's	4095	A
he's he'll be five in in July and it's just hard to believe that you know time has has flown by so quick so yeah	4095	A
so i don't know it's it's	4095	A
they're pretty fun they're they're good kids so yeah well uh what are you majoring in in college	4095	A
in physics	4095	A
well you won't you won't deal much with kids in that area	4095	A
no	4095	A
oh i know it seems like forever and i think uh i i don't know my husband you know wants to go back for um some uh master degree and stuff and i just think	4095	A
oh i just not into that right now maybe in a couple of years i you know i might want to do that but it's i don't know i i was glad to have gotten out so	4095	A
yeah that was uh i enjoyed my time but you know met my husband and met him there so it was uh	4095	A
a a nice nice sideline of it so that was good but uh	4095	A
well what else about kids how do you think people spend time with their kids do you have any idea	4095	A
kind of different huh	4095	A
yeah	4095	A
uh-huh	4095	A
yeah	4095	A
we go we went to the zoo Saturday as a matter of fact yeah it's an adventure with three kids i mean it's it's fun but you i mean with three of them_1	4095	A
two's pretty easy-	4095	A
-okay i guess we're on uh capital punishment uh	4047	A
my- my feeling by the way is that i think there is a need for capital punishment i don't think it ought to be applied to every crime obviously but there is a need how do you feel about it	4047	A
uh-huh	4047	A
uh	4047	A
yeah i think it does does get uh strung out too long that they uh they keep people there ten twelve years uh uh that seems to be the norm	4047	A
um	4047	A
i- i don't know how effective a deterrent it is when when that happens uh but	4047	A
more and more people are being executed for crimes i think down in Texas uh just today or yesterday didn't you have one an execution down there	4047	A
yeah well they haven't executed anybody in uh in our state of New Hampshire since i think nineteen forty four or somewhere around that time frame it's it's been a long time	4047	A
we do have the death penalty but uh they don't use it very much instead they sentence them_1 to life and uh we end up as you say uh fitting the footing the bill the next forty or fifty years	4047	A
i think one interesting question would be uh	4047	A
uh you know as far as circumstances uh i think we agree if somebody you know is involved with a premeditated murder or you know a cold blooded first degree murder they deserve the death penalty that's in my opinion i don't know how do you feel about that	4047	A
if they take another human life you know and they've they've planned to do this	4047	A
or they're doing it for pay don't you think that deserves the- the death penalty	4047	A
now how about drug dealers where they don't directly take a life you know it's not like they're pulling the the the trigger on a gun or or something like that what do you think about uh major drug dealers getting the death penalty	4047	A
i think capital punishment in those instances is probably even more effective than for uh the just the common street criminal that kills somebody	4047	A
that person probably isn't thinking too much about it but these major drug dealers uh you know they got some brains they wouldn't be in the business if they didn't have and if they're threatened with the death penalty i think it might make a difference on them_1	4047	A
uh-huh	4047	A
that's right it certainly ruins a lot of lives uh whereas a you know somebody that uh	4047	A
is holding up a bank and shoots somebody effects a fairly small circle of people i mean the relatives and friends of the person that was killed	4047	A
but but a drug dealer a major drug dealer is effecting what thousands of lives	4047	A
and in effect causing some of them_1 to die	4047	A
oh is that right	4047	A
uh-huh	4047	A
yeah and- and-	4047	A
uh-huh	4047	A
that LSD even gets into the grade schools when they sell these uh stickers they look like uh i guess they're dots on a piece of paper or something	4047	A
and uh you know that's really that's really a crime to give it to the young kids like that	4047	A
well i guess we've talked about all we can on this topic what do you think	4047	A
okay well it's been nice talking with you hope you have a nice day good evening talk to you later bye-bye	4047	A
oh i believe there is- you know there is a need for it like you said it shouldn't be applied to every every crime you know	4047	B
uh	4047	B
i feel like you know they need to	4047	B
instead of giving the people on- on uh	4047	B
you know like death row and stuff just leaving them_1 there and sit there and make taxpayer pay for it i think they ought to do something about it	4047	B
yeah	4047	B
yeah we had uh one just yeah couple days ago	4047	B
yeah	4047	B
yeah that's what i think that they need to do something to change that because	4047	B
i don't think the taxpayers should have to pay for that guy to stay in the stay in there for life you know	4047	B
it sure does	4047	B
well that not they're partly you know they're a lot responsible for it because_1 they're the ones selling the drugs to the to the uh	4047	B
dealers out on the street you know and i think they they need to get capital- the capital punishment	4047	B
yeah	4047	B
oh yeah i think it would too you know sometimes i think they ought to just take them_1 out and shoot them_1 and just you know but uh	4047	B
that's my opinion on some of the cases	4047	B
because_1 i think drugs is a bad deal and stuff	4047	B
yeah	4047	B
oh yeah	4047	B
um-hum	4047	B
and you know it's	4047	B
especially i just saw something on TV tonight on the news about LSD in a school over in Dallas so	4047	B
yep so it's	4047	B
effecting it's way down there in the high schools and stuff and	4047	B
i think drug dealers need to be sent to prison for life imprisonment and stuff you know or given the death penalty	4047	B
yeah	4047	B
uh yeah	4047	B
okay you too	4047	B
all right bye	4047	B
uh yes i am to uh both questions	4090	B
uh yeah we do we um	4090	B
uh basically there's the you know expenses that	4090	B
are fixed during the month you know the ones that come every every month and	4090	B
we uh enter those into uh into a spread sheet	4090	B
and uh what's ever left uh after that we you know we we sit down and agree on kind of what	4090	B
you know what sort of range we're gonna	4090	B
generally gonna shoot for	4090	B
so what do you do	4090	B
um-hum	4090	B
wow	4090	B
yeah	4090	B
yeah all allocated out yeah	4090	B
all the	4090	B
checks yeah	4090	B
right yeah we found that um	4090	B
it's definitely helped uh get a handle on kind of	4090	B
the unnecessary expenses we were before we started doing that kind of a thing we were um spending uh	4090	B
money for things that	4090	B
you know we probably tended to eat out a bit more than the than we should have and it was easy to uh let things get out of hand we thought it uh	4090	B
thought it to be really helpful we've gotten some of our loans paid off early	4090	B
because of this and and stuff like that so	4090	B
yeah	4090	B
that's a lot of money but	4090	B
yeah	4090	B
um-hum	4090	B
yeah the other the other thing that that we've found that that helps if	4090	B
you know we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit it's just to uh uh get out the money in advance and put it in uh	4090	B
um so long as it wasn't you know unreasonably high but for things like food expenses or or whatever just put it in a	4090	B
in an envelope or whatever and that way it kind of forced us to uh stick to that amount	4090	B
and then once that was gone well if the entertainment amount was gone for the month oh it's gone	4090	B
so	4090	B
we we haven't we our our initial goal was just to retire our debt uh completely retire our debt for car payments and credit card	4090	B
uh credit card debt and and all of that and we're just at a point where where we could start thinking about it so	4090	B
yeah i	4090	B
um-hum	4090	B
a study	4090	B
yeah	4090	B
yeah i'm actually in the in the master-	4090	B
okay Eric um	4090	A
are you married and do you have a family	4090	A
okay and do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances	4090	A
uh-huh	4090	A
uh-huh	4090	A
okay	4090	A
um	4090	A
well that's basically what we do um about every every three months or so	4090	A
we reevaluate our budget and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest	4090	A
and then we divvy them up between	4090	A
our four pay checks i work part time at night and he works and my husband works full time days and so we have the four pay checks with that works out nice because we get paid every week	4090	A
and so that does help that helps a lot	4090	A
and then um we don't have a lot extra- extra for extra spending so it's pretty well earmarked	4090	A
yeah every- every penny is earmarked but um it we have found that that works the best and	4090	A
and so if we can just divide them up all the major bills up in fact we	4090	A
found it easier to divide the major bills up you know cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half and and divide those up between all	4090	A
um-hum and so we are not taking a huge sum out out of one and then the next pay check we're real short or	4090	A
that's true	4090	A
uh-huh	4090	A
yeah	4090	A
well it helps you to focus	4090	A
where your money goes and and i'm sure you felt the same- the same frustration before you got on a budget but	4090	A
you're wondering my when you put down all the money that you do bring in and then you're saying my word where did all that money go where does it go	4090	A
huh and also we have found that if we write down	4090	A
and- and we did this we're not real consistent with this but we did it for about a month and we wrote down everything that we bought with you know	4090	A
every paycheck	4090	A
and so we could see where every penny went and it was really interesting to see	4090	A
just what you do spend and and like i say we haven't been real consistent with it it's	4090	A
we should because_1 it does help	4090	A
uh-huh	4090	A
uh-huh	4090	A
just stick to that uh-huh that is	4090	A
uh-huh	4090	A
yeah	4090	A
that	4090	A
that sounds like a really good idea	4090	A
and it really helpful	4090	A
um have you developed a savings plan or IRAs or anything like that yet	4090	A
oh uh-huh	4090	A
uh-huh	4090	A
oh that's good that's a good feeling	4090	A
my husband just graduated from the university uh	4090	A
a year ago so finally finally we are getting to that point too so are you still going to school or	4090	A
okay	4062	B
yes- yes i'm sure that it	4062	B
okay	4062	B
well it- it just that that uh recording would begin when the person who called	4062	B
presses one but	4062	B
okay	4062	B
oh i'm not in San Francisco i'm in Frisco Texas	4062	B
where are you	4062	B
Raleigh North Carolina i thought you said Rowlett we have a little town out here yes okay you know where Dallas is	4062	B
oh okay i am familiar- i am familiar with computers	4062	B
no we don't my husband uh takes care of our finances and he just uh just does it all all manually he keeps uh a book sort of	4062	B
he uh doesn't keep it on the computer i work with computers and we have one at home but he doesn't use it for that	4062	B
right	4062	B
and that is a software program that was written for your i mean that you	4062	B
just for Macintosh	4062	B
too much detail	4062	B
was it too much detail to it	4062	B
primitive	4062	B
uh i am not sure right now i think he is keeping he has it uh kind of a forecast out for oh about the next uh eighteen months or so he keeps track of all of um	4062	B
you know the the payments that are due when and uh what pays off when and uh of course he knows ahead of time about when the uh	4062	B
home owner's is due and when the car insurance is due and such like that and he just	4062	B
sort of keeps uh i guess you would say a running record of it so that he he knows at what point uh we are going to be able to to have uh some extra money	4062	B
um-hum	4062	B
well that's nice	4062	B
now you expect it	4062	B
i think	4062	A
let's see i didn't- i didn't hear the message that it says you make the uh maybe i didn't press it hard enough let's try again	4062	A
hum	4062	A
right okay so so i will just assume that we are being recorded now i thought that they had a confirmation message when that occurred but perhaps not uh anyway i did press let me press one once again	4062	A
well i'll i'll take it that that did it okay so um the answer to that well maybe i should answer the question first since i have had so long to think about it um	4062	A
i uh use a uh a program on my Macintosh which is called Dollars and Cents actually it hails from the bay area where you're from and uh	4062	A
oh Frisco Texas uh gee i don't even know	4062	A
Raleigh North Carolina	4062	A
i see okay well anyway it doesn't hail from the area where you are	4062	A
uh but uh uh anyway uh so so anyway i use this a personal- personal accounting program on my Macintosh to keep track of expenses but it also has a budget feature but i don't find it very useful because it makes all kinds of assumptions that aren't	4062	A
the case in in my situation so i use the the little spread sheets for that i- i- i don't know actually i think most people who are in the series are a little bit familiar with computers but if you're not let me know and i will give you more explanation	4062	A
okay so have you do you do you use a computer to do your budgeting	4062	A
um-hum	4062	A
i found that it was uh you- well you have a lot more information if you use a computer because you just can't keep track of everything manually you'll never go back through the old slips and see what your electric bill was and so forth but	4062	A
if you if you can just print it out it gives you a lot better feel for how you stand compared to last year	4062	A
um	4062	A
for Macintosh yes	4062	A
um it's called Dollars and Cents and actually the leading program is Managing Your Monies by Andrew Tobias but i used that one year and it was so awful that i just gave up	4062	A
excuse me	4062	A
it was well it would bring up a new screen for everything you know you you um	4062	A
you would make one uh like for example if you were reconciling your check account and you wanted to	4062	A
change a transaction let's say you wanted to add in interest or put in a fee or something it took about three screens to do that and you could only see the one transaction you were working on all the earlier transactions were hidden it was just it it you just	4062	A
yeah it had tunnel vision i mean it had a lot of features but they were all so hard to use that i never never really used any of them so	4062	A
uh i- i- i read since then though that they've redesigned- redesigned- uh redesigned the interface so probably it's a little better uh than it was before um	4062	A
so um do you do you do a uh a yearly budget or a monthly budget or	4062	A
right	4062	A
um-hum	4062	A
uh yeah i try and uh i think that one of the things i've i've worked on is cutting down on the number of transactions	4062	A
uh so so i- i instead of paying bills monthly if they are not very much uh i just pay enough for two months when i pay one month's bill and that way i have to send you know substantially	4062	A
fewer number of things out in the mail which saves a lot of time	4062	A
and uh	4062	A
uh gee i pray my pay my cable TV annually	4062	A
you get a discount for doing that they give you the thirteenth month of month of service free if they remember	4062	A
but they say i- uh they always forget you every year they mess it up and forget to give me credit or or or shall i say five out of the last six years	4062	A
so i called in and uh at first i got kind of upset but now	4062	A
now yeah now i know they are going to do that um	4062	A
well um you know i guess that it's pretty deep feelings uh i just uh went back and rented uh the movie what is it Good Morning Vietnam	4004	B
and uh got that uh uh some insight there to to kind of help me put together the feelings i really appreciated the the little uh	4004	B
English class where the uh the uh fellow just wouldn't do anything- you know the guy's gouging- gouging your eyes out what are you going to do you know wait for him to finish me off	4004	B
and uh it it was uh good to remember the uh that that kind of uh Asian philosophy	4004	B
that uh	4004	B
no no i was kind of an in between uh finally drew a high draft number and you	4004	B
oh	4004	B
well i personally uh you know uh i just went in limbo i had a passport and was ready to go	4004	B
or um uh out of the country or or join special forces either one	4004	B
i mean i i- just didn't know so uh	4004	B
um yeah just a second	4004	B
<b_aside> you restrict access cause a lot of times people are trying to cut them out okay <e_aside>	4004	B
sure now well Mark um what was that again	4004	B
no not not really	4004	B
um	4004	B
downside um uh well Robert Blythe says we should uh uh	4004	B
yeah go into the grief that that's there and we're our presidents have always avoided that as a country so it's pretty serious really uh	4004	B
a lot of things that aren't being addressed	4004	B
yeah	4004	B
Gulf of Tonkin uh resolution and was it a dolphin or a torpedo things you remember that	4004	B
yeah yeah only only it was foggy and President- uh President- finally President Johnson said well they- they weren't really sure whether it was a dolphin or a torpedo	4004	B
isn't that something	4004	B
um-hum	4004	B
okay	4004	B
hey Mark uh i've got to go um we'll um see you i guess our five minutes are up according to me are they to you	4004	B
yeah okay bye-bye	4004	B
so how do you feel about the Vietnam War	4004	A
um-hum	4004	A
yeah i saw that as well	4004	A
um-hum	4004	A
um-hum well uh were you over in Vietnam or	4004	A
i'm i was much too young i was born in sixty seven so	4004	A
um in a way both my well uh both my brothers were um draft age but neither of them wound up going over which i think they were very happy for	4004	A
uh	4004	A
um-hum	4004	A
yeah	4004	A
um-hum	4004	A
well um so well do you do you feel that it was worth what we did over there or	4004	A
okay	4004	A
um do you think i mean do you think our investment- the investment in lives and money was worth it	4004	A
i totally agree with that	4004	A
um well what what effects do you think it's had in our country	4004	A
um-hum	4004	A
um-hum	4004	A
um-hum well i think i think that you know that's pretty typical of the of the entire entire involvement over in that you know that nothing was really addressed it wasn't- it wasn't you know it was never we we announced that we were going to war it was it was such a gradual	4004	A
and subtle you know the um you know increasement of of force that	4004	A
um-hum	4004	A
i vaguely- vaguely remember we um we had a we had a um spy ship torpedoed or something or -something like that	4004	A
oh well	4004	A
um-hum	4004	A
um	4004	A
so um do you do you do you think that like our um for example like in in this- this past war the Persian Gulf war	4004	A
that uh that you see it seemed to me that that Bush was going going to extraordinary lengths to um	4004	A
you know prepare the country for war yeah	4004	A
okay	4004	A
uh i wasn't really keeping count- count but i guess that's good-bye	4004	A
bye	4004	A
do you do for exercise do you do anything regularly	4053	A
do you uh how often	4053	A
well that's good	4053	A
that's good	4053	A
do you walk very far	4053	A
yeah well that's	4053	A
that's not bad i mean	4053	A
i know um just probably in the last four or five months i've been able to pick up um	4053	A
i go to a gym and and uh ride the bike and do the what's called the stair master	4053	A
so that's uh i try to do that three or four times a week	4053	A
well	4053	A
um uh i- i am uh	4053	A
uh i didn't- i have a six month old baby he's my third one and didn't do it much while i was pregnant but um but the about at six weeks i really began picking it back up so i've been doing it at least for the last	4053	A
uh last five six months	4053	A
so but before that i did	4053	A
uh i did biking i like to swim a lot too	4053	A
so	4053	A
i	4053	A
it's tough	4053	A
it is	4053	A
um-hum	4053	A
yeah i bet well did you do you like the rowing- rowing machine because i did that for a while and	4053	A
i- i didn't i just didn't feel like it was doing much for me	4053	A
and i don't i don't know if i wasn't doing it properly or what but	4053	A
i didn't i didn't feel like it was doing much except maybe	4053	A
maybe for my arms	4053	A
um-hum	4053	A
yeah	4053	A
yeah	4053	A
yeah	4053	A
well so do you do you enjoy your walking or is it just because you have to exercise you know you need to exercise	4053	A
yeah	4053	A
yeah	4053	A
ah	4053	A
yeah well i- i run after preschoolers at this point so	4053	A
yeah	4053	A
well uh yes and no i mean i don't	4053	A
i mean you know we play around and fool around but i don't i don't ever feel like you know i've i've	4053	A
really worked out but i- i really have you know first going to the gym was really really tough and i've been doing it like early in the mornings before the kids wake up so	4053	A
but now it's you know i don't like to wake up but once i'm up i enjoy it and- i and- and i enjoy the the challenge of seeing how much further i can get and um	4053	A
right now i'm	4053	A
you know increasing levels on the bike or increasing time on the the stair master and um	4053	A
so that's	4053	A
you know and i only have a certain amount of time i can do it and so it's okay how many calories can i burn at this in this amount of time so	4053	A
yeah um i- i'm a member of President's and so the the cycle tells you how far you've	4053	A
you have uh levels that you can um ride on or walk on and it tells you you know how far you've walked or how far you've um	4053	A
biked and how many calories it's burned and you can set it up where um you can be going up hills or you can just be going just constant level and so it's	4053	A
i walk	4053	B
uh about every other day	4053	B
no	4053	B
that's not very much really	4053	B
uh a couple miles	4053	B
have- have you done that a long time	4053	B
that sounds pretty good you're	4053	B
you're better than i am i uh	4053	B
i- i have purchased any number of well i say any number i've purchased three different uh types of exercise equipment uh mainly uh	4053	B
uh a rower and two different uh kinds of uh	4053	B
{exercycles} but uh i have teenagers and it drives me nuts when i get on and	4053	B
uh somebody's screwed the tension all the way up so you can hardly move	4053	B
no i didn't like that	4053	B
i didn't like that i uh the uh like i say the	4053	B
the main problem with me is i've got to have something that's repeatable	4053	B
and uh	4053	B
walking is repeatable and bicycling is repeatable i- i bicycle once in a while	4053	B
but if it's any kind of equipment then uh	4053	B
i have uh four kids at home and and	4053	B
they just there's a joy i think in changing the settings	4053	B
and it takes me a while to get back into it so	4053	B
well there're two kinds one kind is where you just get out and you do it because you've got to do it and the other kind is	4053	B
is uh actually most of the walking i've been doing these days is is just a bunch that i'm with uh	4053	B
uh a couple of people in my group who we just	4053	B
take off and walk uh	4053	B
uh over to the shopping center and	4053	B
walk through the shopping center and then come back which is about a two mile trip	4053	B
so it's but it's a kind of sedentary job here	4053	B
i don't know about you but uh	4053	B
uh	4053	B
this job just involves sitting in in front of a keyboard all day long writing computer programs	4053	B
is is that right so you get uh so you get more exercise than	4053	B
than uh	4053	B
that's a fair amount of exercise by itself right	4053	B
are these are these uh does this gear have some kind of a little uh electronic uh thing uh read out on it	4053	B
i do but they're but they're both out of college so i have one who's uh living in an apartment in another city	4016	B
and i have one who's actually living with me because um because of the economy and the job that she's got but she's about	4016	B
she's on the verge of moving to her own apartment so what about you	4016	B
uh-huh	4016	B
oh little ones then	4016	B
yeah	4016	B
wow oh you mean like state parks that kind of	4016	B
uh-huh uh-huh	4016	B
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh	4016	B
you probably have pretty ones there when you were saying parks i was just uh we have a different terrain here so	4016	B
uh	4016	B
um-hum	4016	B
it's flat	4016	B
yes so the mountains would take a while to get around to to find any there are some as a matter of fact but um what other things do the kids like to do	4016	B
like weekends or during during during the winter do they ski or	4016	B
it is expensive yeah	4016	B
yeah	4016	B
um-hum	4016	B
hm	4016	B
yeah that's fun	4016	B
yes that's	4016	B
um-hum	4016	B
um-hum	4016	B
all of those things yeah	4016	B
well the twelve year old probably feels he or she's much older than the four year old so there should be different activities in in their minds in at any rate yeah	4016	B
well that's good	4016	B
uh-huh	4016	B
your first experience with it well it um it's interesting there's a dramatic change at thirteen and it doesn't end -until about twenty five but	4016	B
it's part of what's supposed to happen or they can't fly the nest so um that's- that's one way of looking at it	4016	B
anyway i was trying to think what what what we spent a lot of time well reading i loved to read to the kids when they were when they were younger uh obviously not any more but	4016	B
and uh we still we	4016	B
like um Disney movies we really got into them when they were young there were a number of movies that we liked and we just simply liked the experience of the movies and um	4016	B
ironically uh my twenty seven- my twenty four and my twenty two year old last year for Christmas we rented um Jungle Book you know	4016	B
and uh i gave one of them Jungle Book and one of them Fantasia for Christmas this year and it was one of their favorite gifts so	4016	B
so that's something um besides the another thing we used to do is watch PBS together which there were a lot of um my son loves science programs and um	4016	B
we would all just stop and watch whatever the mountain lions were doing or whatever was going on	4016	B
yeah which was which was fun yeah and so	4016	B
yeah we did and um and we enjoyed that um my now we my kids back when they were younger- younger got did we would go from here to like Colorado and ski	4016	B
and they did both uh learn to be scuba divers	4016	B
uh we went once on a vacation with my parents	4016	B
to an island and they snorkeled and that that really got them you know fascinated with the deep and so they actually went through all the course and all the trouble in the middle of Missouri as we were living in Kansas City then	4016	B
and uh went and i don't can't remember what it's called uh but it's	4016	B
okay Liz do you have any children	4016	A
uh-huh	4016	A
oh	4016	A
uh-huh	4016	A
oh uh-huh well we have five children and uh their ages range- from range from twelve to four	4016	A
uh yep and uh	4016	A
uh some things we like to do together with our family are um in the summer time we like to go to parks we	4016	A
that's our thing we pack up a picnic and and go to every park from Northern Utah to Southern Utah	4016	A
well mostly mostly just play parks yeah so	4016	A
um with the with the kids and such we don't get a lot of vacationing in so we just like to take little weekend trips and go to parks and such	4016	A
so	4016	A
oh uh-huh	4016	A
yep when i was a teenager i spent some time with my cousins in Dallas	4016	A
and so i i remember it's pretty it is flat oh	4016	A
uh-huh	4016	A
yeah	4016	A
well we like to	4016	A
weekends um	4016	A
no we're not into skiing it's just too expensive we	4016	A
we can't do that so um we like to uh rent videos and sit down and have a video bash pop popcorn and	4016	A
and do that so we've done that quite a bit this winter and um we like to play board games together sometimes it's a little difficult with the younger one um	4016	A
but the three older boys we have some fun times with those after the little girls go to bed	4016	A
and let's see uh we like to get real wild and crazy and play hide and go seek and oh yeah things like that	4016	A
oh yes	4016	A
yeah yeah he's really patient though he with us he's he's a real fun twelve year old so	4016	A
but he's rapidly approaching {teenagehood} so we'll see what happens	4016	A
yeah uh-huh	4016	A
oh	4016	A
oh boy	4016	A
oh	4016	A
oh uh-huh	4016	A
uh-huh	4016	A
oh	4016	A
uh-huh	4016	A
oh how fun	4016	A
oh	4016	A
oh i think that's fun	4016	A
oh	4016	A
oh	4016	A
yeah	4016	A
yes i think that is good that sounds	4016	A
uh-huh	4016	A
now were you able to get away on some vacations and	4016	A
oh oh how fun	4016	A
oh	4016	A
oh how fun	4016	A
uh-huh	4016	A
oh wow	4016	A
uh hello Steve	4040	B
uh you were going to talk about child care	4040	B
um-hum	4040	B
um-hum	4040	B
um-hum	4040	B
i see how much how much do they charge	4040	B
uh-huh that seems relatively low by commercial standards isn't it usually about sixty to a hundred a week	4040	B
right um so you've you've been you've been pleased with the service	4040	B
uh-huh	4040	B
uh how long have you been taking your son there	4040	B
uh-huh before that did he go somewhere else or	4040	B
i see	4040	B
you say you went back to school	4040	B
oh i see uh-huh	4040	B
uh-huh	4040	B
um gee i think where where does she go to school	4040	B
uh-huh okay yeah i had a student who went there at one time	4040	B
but i think we're getting off the topic so	4040	B
so um let's see i mean i- i was uh reading- i read a lot of articles on child care back when it was when there was a debate in Congress over funding of uh child care centers and what should be done	4040	B
and i came out uh very much in favor of a tax credit approach where parents would be given a tax credit and they would select whatever services they wanted for their child rather than to have the government subsidize certain providers	4040	B
and uh that was i- i thought it was important- well i mean it is important uh that that people have the opportunity to select the service that they would choose	4040	B
because a lot of kids are in you know in centers well- well not really centers but they're being cared for by neighbors and uh	4040	B
uh that's the sort of they- they- they prefer it that way the parents do because they know the people who are caring for their kids and they don't have to take them_1 very far	4040	B
plus about a third of the kids are in church run centers and there was a big church state controversy over whether the government could	4040	B
fund those are not i think they ultimately decided to but they placed a lot of restrictions on it so it wasn't clear that the church child care centers would want to go to the trouble	4040	B
um so uh anyway i continue to be an advocate of the um of the tax credit approach now myself i'm not married so i don't have any kids and it's not a problem but uh	4040	B
still i know a lot of people that do and uh you know i mean you you you really wouldn't- wouldn't um uh well i'm on	4040	B
gee i'm on the benefits committee at the university here and uh child care is a topic of conversation we the university started up a center this year but it's about two miles away from campus and i'm not sure it's going to be real convenient for people to take their kids over there	4040	B
uh-huh	4040	B
uh-huh	4040	B
uh-huh	4040	B
right uh-huh	4040	B
yeah it's just a lot of time	4040	B
yeah well they say they claim that it's a better environment for kids than to be in with all the students	4040	B
uh-huh	4040	B
yeah	4040	B
yeah i am sure that a lot of it had to do with how cheap it was to acquire the building if they would've built a new building then it would've i'm i'm sure it would have cost a lot more than if they uh if they put it down where they did where real estate's probably cheaper	4040	B
um-hum	4040	B
so- so- so what do you think about the about the child about the tax credit versus the subsidy approach which seems- seems most appealing to you	4040	B
yeah	4040	B
i think	4040	B
well the-	4040	B
that's right yeah	4040	B
well i mean they- they yeah the issue- the issue is whether they can uh take it off of their taxes or whether the government decides which centers are qualified the other problem-	4040	B
hello	4040	A
yeah uh	4040	A
we well- me and my wife we got a five year old and we have	4040	A
uh	4040	A
kind of like child rearing he we have problems with him every now and then but other than that it's it's pretty he's a pretty good kid	4040	A
and we uh really don't really have any problem with finding day care for him because i'm in the service and we just take him to the day care on base	4040	A
they charge about forty five dollars a week	4040	A
um yeah it's it's pretty pretty expensive on the outside	4040	A
oh yeah they do a lot of you know lot of stuff in in their day care and stuff	4040	A
oh about a year now	4040	A
well before that my wife was kind of stay at home mom now she went back to school so	4040	A
no the wife went back to school	4040	A
so he's been there for almost a year now	4040	A
she goes to UT uh Arlington	4040	A
yeah uh	4040	A
yeah	4040	A
yeah	4040	A
um-hum	4040	A
um yeah	4040	A
yeah well- well when i was stationed in Lubbock Texas uh they had a child care center right on base uh right at the school i mean	4040	A
and that helped out my wife because_1 she just went part time there and you know take a couple of classes a week but	4040	A
and uh i think it's a good deal- deal but um like you were saying it's about two miles from the school and that's	4040	A
it's not going to be very good i think they should talk about putting one right on the campus itself	4040	A
well they kind of have this i think in a different building you know on right on the	4040	A
uh edge of the campus and everything where they really didn't get in	4040	A
in	4040	A
oh yeah um um i think they used one of the existing buildings they already had	4040	A
so you know it it worked out pretty good	4040	A
uh	4040	A
well i haven't really thought about it like that	4040	A
because well you know we pay	4040	A
excuse me we pay for any you know the child care but we don't pay as much as they do off base	4040	A
uh i think the government should subsidize some of it you know	4040	A
to give the parents you know some break on on the money portion of it	4040	A
well my position in general is that i'm supportive of it but i'm not supportive of the way that it's currently administered	4058	B
um	4058	B
it takes so long with uh the appeals process uh that it's uh uh simply impossible to say that it's that it's consistent administration of justice uh	4058	B
if if the penalty could be executed swiftly and surely upon people who deserved it when there was uh evidence uh beyond a	4058	B
a reasonable doubt that they had committed a a crime worthy of it then i think it should be done	4058	B
that's right but as it stands now it's not a deterrent we just had a fellow here in our county who has he's been on death row for seventeen years and just had his sentence overturned for the third time uh on a technicality	4058	B
everybody knows he did it	4058	B
this last technicality was simply because the language of the decision handed down by the jury uh explaining- uh saying that he should get the death penalty was not precisely as it is stated in the statute that it should be	4058	B
and that was it i mean it was a a very simple i mean they fully intended to give him the death penalty uh they had a unanimous decision but when they drafted the uh decision	4058	B
uh they did it wrong and it was just a very minor	4058	B
very minor uh mistake but it was enough for uh the state supreme court to say that the uh that the decision was invalid and that they had to empanel a new jury to consider the death penalty again	4058	B
that kind of thing uh and and and the way that people search and search for those kind of things just uh just disgusts me	4058	B
and with	4058	B
uh with with it being that way	4058	B
it ends up costing us so much money so much more to have the death penalty than to not have it that uh i'm almost inclined to say do away with it	4058	B
the the problem that i see is uh what do we have instead	4058	B
here in Georgia uh we don't have a a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole	4058	B
if someone gets life in prison they are generally released in seven years if they behave well	4058	B
and we have had people get out in seven years and commit uh another murder	4058	B
uh	4058	B
that just shouldn't be so but so i say uh you know i could tolerate getting rid of the death penalty if we could have life without the possibility of parole	4058	B
yeah	4058	B
there's video tape of it	4058	B
yeah	4058	B
um-hum	4058	B
okay_1 Toby this is Brian White	4058	A
and our topic i guess tonight is on capital punishment and how we feel about that um	4058	A
if you don't mind uh how do you feel about capital punishment	4058	A
okay	4058	A
uh-huh	4058	A
uh-huh	4058	A
and that way it can be a deterrent- a deterrent	4058	A
uh-huh	4058	A
yeah	4058	A
uh-huh	4058	A
oh great	4058	A
the response yeah	4058	A
uh	4058	A
yes	4058	A
uh-huh	4058	A
uh-huh	4058	A
yes	4058	A
right	4058	A
yes	4058	A
right right i tend to agree with you uh i'm kind of uh torn between two items however i i definitely believe- believe in due process that if a person is found guilty	4058	A
so that we're not ramrodding a a guilty verdict on them that it's uh up for review in uh the appeal process	4058	A
however i tend to agree with you that well i don't tend to agree with i definitely agree with you that	4058	A
there are people that are going to make sure that every T is crossed every I is dotted and to make sure that everything is just right otherwise you know someone gets off on a technicality now	4058	A
not only in the courts is that costing us	4058	A
money and millions and millions of dollars and wasting our taxpayers and uh clogging up the courts but also	4058	A
when the uh	4058	A
the detectives the homicide detectives and so forth when they're researching when they are gathering the evidence they're they're bending over backwards uh	4058	A
in typically what i believe is an open and shut case where the guy is guilty there are seven eyewitnesses they saw it happen they have testified what happened um	4058	A
they-	4058	A
yeah exactly exactly	4058	A
and the guy is as sound mind and and so forth he's he's not an idiot uh he wasn't acting i- i don't know you know in that case	4058	A
we're we're spending money in the in the judicial system we're spending money in the law enforcement area trying to verify all this kind of information	4058	A
and the and the individual's guilty i believe that if we have cash capital punishment that it should be executed swiftly	4058	A
that it should uh be taken care of not after seven levels of appeal but after a couple levels appeal- of appeal	4058	A
uh under certain- certain circumstances	4058	A
those circumstances would be	4058	A
very good	4089	B
uh well let me put it this way it's it's relatively uh it's very good if- if you are a little bit away from the city and it's and it's wonderful on days that it rains	4089	B
but uh downtown they have a few problems but it's	4089	B
but it's fairly localized it's not like uh Los Angeles where i used to live	4089	B
yes- yes uh	4089	B
it i guess that's the the major problem with most cities except except places like uh	4089	B
oh Mexico City or some place like that well i guess it's it's a problem there too but but they do have some places where that's caused by power plants and and stuff like that	4089	B
yeah	4089	B
although there is one thing that i uh i learned in in	4089	B
chemistry many years ago and that's uh i don't know are are you a chemist	4089	B
okay anyway this is principle called Le Chatelier's principal as i remember and it's	4089	B
basically uh	4089	B
uh when you have uh	4089	B
a reaction and it it uh the reaction will go until it until- until it kind of comes to a balance but if you take away some of the products of that reaction then the reaction will go farther	4089	B
and so uh the illustration that the chemistry teacher pointed out was he said he said in a in a desirable area	4089	B
people will move in until until bad things happen that cause the uh desirabilities to go to	4089	B
you know to uh balance- kind of balance out he says if it's not air pollution it'll be	4089	B
it will be uh congestion or price of land or something like that so what i'm looking at here in the Portland area is is a temporary situation it's a very desirable area as far as i'm concerned and uh	4089	B
the wonderful air the lack of of uh congestion the low low cost of of uh property uh	4089	B
in a few years something's going to cause i mean there's uh people just going to continue to move in until we either	4089	B
and and-	4089	B
and as many people move in as move out	4089	B
and it'll come to a balance and then if they come along and they add new freeways so let's say they reduce traffic congestion then air pollution will get bad or something else and that's happened in California that's for sure	4089	B
uh as far as in Atlanta do they have a uh do they have uh regulations on on uh like inspection	4089	B
yeah the grandfather type thing	4089	B
yeah	4089	B
although i think that's partly because it's harder to get parts and and uh	4089	B
so let's see what was my other question uh	4089	B
my wife thinks this is uh a uh sales call so she's telling me to talk to you about	4089	B
one of the problems with uh she thinks it's from- from uh our cable company	4089	B
uh let's see what else we have uh	4089	B
let's see do you live	4089	B
you don't live too close- do you live close to the city or far away from it	4089	B
okay downtown	4089	B
do they have smog days there	4089	B
uh	4089	B
how's the quality of air in Portland	4089	A
really	4089	A
um-hum	4089	A
um-hum probably a lot of ozone lot of smog	4089	A
yeah it	4089	A
oh yeah i've heard that Los Angeles is horrible and Denver is i hear is really bad	4089	A
Atlanta's Atlanta's moderately bad um you know we have we have a big problem with ozone um	4089	A
and you know it's generally you know it's it it's quite often you know be a very hazy sort of day you know because there'll just be this pollution hanging in the air	4089	A
um	4089	A
i think a lot i think most- well i think most of our problems caused by automobile emissions	4089	A
because_1 you know it's a very you know mobile city	4089	A
um-hum	4089	A
um-hum	4089	A
hm	4089	A
um-hum	4089	A
of heavy industry yeah i think i think the has been you know relatively good about	4089	A
um you know having regulations at least in the last twenty years or so about	4089	A
industry- industry pollution but it just seems that i think- i think i think we really suffer because you know we don't have any sort of an organized mass transit system any sort of you know like high speed rail or even you know even even you know decent regular passenger rail across the country	4089	A
um it seems it seems like like there's a lot- you know there's a lot- there's a lot more federal subsidies for automobile you know for- through through the construction- through the construction of highways for automobiles	4089	A
yeah	4089	A
hm	4089	A
i know a little bit of chemistry	4089	A
um-hum	4089	A
um-hum	4089	A
um-hum	4089	A
um-hum	4089	A
um-hum	4089	A
um-hum	4089	A
um-hum	4089	A
um-hum	4089	A
um-hum	4089	A
um-hum	4089	A
until just- gets- the air it can't just- it can't support them and the quality of life they want	4089	A
um-hum	4089	A
um-hum	4089	A
um-hum	4089	A
um-hum	4089	A
um-hum	4089	A
um they they do have automobile- automobile emissions tests but um	4089	A
it's there there's some sort of rule i don't have a car so i don't know the actual specifics but it's like if your- your car is if the make- if the model- model year of your car is like more than twenty years old you don't have to have it inspected any more	4089	A
you know which is which is just kind of ludicrous you know because those are the ones that you'd expect to	4089	A
you know be the hardest be the most- biggest polluters	4089	A
yeah true	4089	A
i basically live downtown	4089	A
and i go to school at Georgia Tech which is pretty much located in the heart of downtown or within a mile from the heart of downtown	4089	A
it's i don't think it's really announced you know in the sense that the way it- the way it is in California but um	4089	A
i have heard on the news in the you know in the past couple of months or so that you know that apparently there's some federal guidelines for um smog and Atlanta's like it	4089	A
so uh	4093	B
does your company do any sort of drug testing	4093	B
uh-huh	4093	B
uh-huh	4093	B
uh-huh	4093	B
um-hum	4093	B
so what are they worried about are they worried about	4093	B
i mean do you is this a secure environment you're in	4093	B
uh-huh	4093	B
uh yeah and not to mention the legal ones which they don't even care about	4093	B
um-hum	4093	B
uh-huh	4093	B
right and you'll be penalized	4093	B
i mean you could lose your job very easily	4093	B
no	4093	B
okay	4093	B
right	4093	B
i guess so right	4093	B
oh yes his life is over at that point	4093	B
yeah i've read things that talk about the number of false or negatives	4093	B
to the number of false positives and you know the number of people you're going to hurt	4093	B
while accomplishing you know whatever you think you're accomplishing is really quite high	4093	B
uh-huh	4093	B
you like the ticket takers	4093	B
engineer	4093	B
it is the only thing is i my what i think is they they're testing for	4093	B
you know especially illegal drugs is part of the real problem the real problem is you want to make sure this guy is on the ball	4093	B
and i think that what they should be doing is performance testing	4093	B
not drug testing you know they should have some sort of video game or something	4093	B
that the guy has to play or you know something like that because if he you know maybe he didn't get any sleep the night before	4093	B
and uh just stayed up too late and for that reason is not on the ball or he's	4093	B
you know he he's unhappy about something or he's sick	4093	B
or uh	4093	B
you know uh using some legal drug that they don't test for i mean i really don't want to be i don't want to die in a train wreck	4093	B
and and it's because i don't want to die that i want them to do a more meaningful test	4093	B
well i can see there be yeah i mean i actually it's some some mixed mixed feeling about feel i mean i feel like okay if you're going to do testing do a meaningful test like a performance test	4093	B
uh	4093	B
the testing itself uh i could see where the testing if it's not if it is a performance test i mean it's directly related doing your job	4093	B
uh it has nothing to do with your personal you know lifestyle	4093	B
uh	4093	B
um-hum	4093	B
well a lot of people say that that would	4093	B
simplify a lot of things uh i tend to	4093	B
i tend to agree just because the attempts to make certain things illegal were such flops	4093	B
yeah they do do random drug testing i i work in the defense industry	4093	A
and so they're they're they're pretty concerned about something like that although in my mind i don't	4093	A
i don't like the idea of having a having like a hit squad come in	4093	A
and suddenly like you know put my employment on the line over uh my lifestyle choices considered-	4093	A
i i don't think considering i don't think it affects my job and like nobody um	4093	A
nobody's life is at at risk i don't think they should really care what i do in my spare time	4093	A
i think i'm not i'm not really sure i think that they're worried that you might uh	4093	A
if if if you're a drug addict you could probably compromise government secrets or something like that	4093	A
but i i think it's a pretty conservative approach to you know uh	4093	A
uh things i think it's like a fifties approach to a to a an an eighties or nineties lifestyle	4093	A
you know i- i don't know i think drugs are pretty pervasive in our society	4093	A
and yeah well also i what i think is a a problem is that there's a there's a lot of things out there that will actually make- let you test positive for drugs when you're you're not even	4093	A
like not even on drugs	4093	A
right	4093	A
i did you see that thing on uh 60 Minutes about the uh the Air Force pilot who um they there was a mistake at the lab	4093	A
and oh it was on in 60 Minutes there was a mistake at the lab and he he tested he was a B fifty two bomber pilot	4093	A
and he he tested positive and he it ruined his career he	4093	A
he uh he was drummed out of the Air Force and he spent i think something like seven years working you know before he was able to work his way back through the the courts to be uh	4093	A
you know i guess it's called exonerated	4093	A
but by then his career is was was ruined because	4093	A
yeah	4093	A
he's he he was seven years and it was just like it it was a an accident	4093	A
and	4093	A
uh-huh	4093	A
yeah	4093	A
oh you know but i but i also uh you know you read things about uh like train car conductors	4093	A
uh which you think of the	4093	A
well no i'm talking about like the guy no i'm i'm talking about the the engineers now that that is pretty scary though	4093	A
uh-huh	4093	A
uh-huh	4093	A
yeah	4093	A
yeah	4093	A
right	4093	A
yeah but then again uh you know i also if i was a conductor i- i i wouldn't want	4093	A
i wouldn't want to have to like you know piss in a little paper cup whenever you know	4093	A
um-hum	4093	A
uh-huh	4093	A
yeah	4093	A
by then i had just had a thought about like what about a what about a police officer you know	4093	A
i mean that then you begin to to wonder if i understand they have like random	4093	A
law enforcement officers have to go through through random random tests just to see i guess like what side of the law they are they're on	4093	A
you know and and i'm beginning to i'm i'm i'm starting to think a little more a little more about this is that i guess should we really be talking about what should we be should we have legalized drugs	4093	A
you know	4093	A
yeah i i think that uh	4093	A
hello Ann	4096	A
um the other day	4096	A
i attended a conference here at Utah State University on recycling	4096	A
and uh	4096	A
i was kind of interested to hear because_1 they had some people from the EPA and lots of different places	4096	A
and uh	4096	A
they	4096	A
had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste	4096	A
well it's not too new	4096	A
oh	4096	A
they really didn't propose any solutions actually they were	4096	A
the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the EPA	4096	A
but he had a lot of uh facts to to give and	4096	A
things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down and	4096	A
and uh	4096	A
uh one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of of news print and he was talking about um	4096	A
the City of New York and how they went and collected all this news print	4096	A
and they could sell it for a while they were able to sell it for some amount per ton and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into recycling they've collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away	4096	A
yeah we're doing some here in in Cash Valley the community here there's uh	4096	A
we've actually got a kind of a nice set up we've got a	4096	A
couple of plants here that actually take uh recycled paper	4096	A
and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not	4096	A
a fire hazard and make it into insulation	4096	A
and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them_1 because they're actually buying it and shipping it in from outside	4096	A
so one of the real keys it sounds like to getting recycling for uh paper or something like that to go is to	4096	A
get some sort of business to actually want it once you've collected it	4096	A
um-hum	4096	A
and there's a paper presented at this conference from a guy from Alabama	4096	A
and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government one was like environmental protection and the other one was	4096	A
oh i can't remember what but the basic idea it was presented to him was	4096	A
how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff we are putting into our landfill	4096	A
and uh the solution that he came up with for plastics	4096	A
and it was really quite amazing because_1 he says well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them_1	4096	A
he came to the conclusion plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's	4096	A
it's low weight but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space	4096	A
and there's almost no energy there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling but there's a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it to produce electricity	4096	A
so his solution was to burn plastic collect it and burn it	4096	A
yeah and it's more than even paper or something like that there's more energy in it per pound or whatever	4096	A
well that was he didn't deal with that he just said burn it he didn't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that so it's not very practical is it	4096	A
yeah well real interesting-	4096	A
um	4096	A
not too much i'm	4096	A
uh i got a bit actually-	4096	A
hello Chuck	4096	B
um-hum	4096	B
um-hum	4096	B
um i didn't think that was a new revelation	4096	B
right	4096	B
so what what is- is the EPA recommending now	4096	B
um-hum	4096	B
yeah	4096	B
why that's a that's a common problem now that seems that has happened in Dallas as well as New York	4096	B
and i try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house and after a while i just quit taking the newspaper because i couldn't recycle it anymore	4096	B
which isn't good for business on the other end either i suppose	4096	B
um-hum	4096	B
right	4096	B
well that's good	4096	B
right there has to be a a reuse for it i mean that's why they recycle	4096	B
the one i think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that uh the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers	4096	B
uh everything from uh waste baskets to carpet to the no stick i mean the sticky slide rugs under the carpet and uh	4096	B
i think they're even putting it in the roadways these days and they're making clothes now that are recycled	4096	B
like the recycled plastic Coke bottles and and milk cartons and things like that	4096	B
um-hum	4096	B
oh really	4096	B
right	4096	B
huh	4096	B
well it's carbon so that makes sense like a carbon fuel of some sort but what	4096	B
what about emissions	4096	B
oh	4096	B
okay	4096	B
no well that's interesting i bet that was a good day at the uh conference then	4096	B
did it change anything for you	4096	B
well do you have children	4087	A
you don't have children	4087	A
and my children are in their twenties now so	4087	A
child care is something that i- i no longer fortunately have to take care of but it is something that was hard	4087	A
at the time just finding finding sitters i	4087	A
did not work though so i didn't have to uh	4087	A
have to worry about you know	4087	A
all day during the day which i think is a real problem	4087	A
uh-huh	4087	A
oh boy	4087	A
no it's really scary and there does seem to be more and more of that if people are doing it	4087	A
instead of grandmothers and aunts and you know	4087	A
that kind of thing where where people are doing it for money	4087	A
and trying to make ends meet then it's it it becomes an entirely different thing	4087	A
and you we keep reading about all these different things that go on child abuse and	4087	A
people with criminal records etcetera i think it would be very frightening	4087	A
and i know some companies have child care facilities at the company but not many of them do	4087	A
yeah	4087	A
do you know how much it is	4087	A
yeah	4087	A
yeah but that's what i've heard is that that you've got to earn an awful lot i mean you know	4087	A
a lot of times the wife's money basically covers what you have to pay out so that doesn't help	4087	A
uh-huh uh-huh	4087	A
yeah that's right well i- i and and uh and then there's the question of you know if	4087	A
what what to look for what's what's going to be uh what's going to be	4087	A
a good place and uh do they	4087	A
do they turn out as well as the ones where the mother stays home that's that's a really difficult issue i know	4087	A
uh-huh	4087	A
you- you haven't decided yet huh	4087	A
no i think it's going to be hard i feel like i was i was lucky to get to be at home and	4087	A
there were a lot of times that it was boring and it and it certainly isn't true is true that didn't	4087	A
didn't set me up for a career but at the same time uh	4087	A
it felt good to be there when they got home from school	4087	A
um those were the stories that	4087	A
that that i got to hear it was even hard to get their father to	4087	A
get to hear them you know they would come home and they'd say all this and then	4087	A
later on you say well tell dad about you know and they go oh i already told you you know it all gone kind of thing	4087	A
oh and that parts good and you get to see them as they progress etcetera	4087	A
but at the same time if you don't have enough money or if you are trying to build a career	4087	A
you know then you have to give everything up just to stay home and i think that's a a real question	4087	A
and uh do you know uh	4087	A
you say they have it at school is it for the students or for the teachers or for both	4087	A
uh-huh	4087	A
uh-huh	4087	A
well what about you and your own background did- did your mother or father stay home or did- did they work or	4087	A
and so you so you were in school	4087	A
and when you came home from school was there some one there or was uh what happened	4087	A
i mean did she get off when you got home or was there some one taking care of you like an older brother or sister or	4087	A
do you remember	4087	A
so you had there was some one there to take care of you yeah	4087	A
yeah cause i think that's another	4087	A
no	4087	B
no	4087	B
oh	4087	B
yeah	4087	B
yeah i agree uh	4087	B
cause i suppose when when i do start having children uh	4087	B
i'd like to stay home for a while but uh	4087	B
you know eventually i'd i might have to put them in day care to work	4087	B
and i think it's hard to find um good day care because just the other night um on the news in Milwaukee um	4087	B
they're closing down a day care because um	4087	B
the- the lady who owns it um slapped a child	4087	B
and um she had a lot of um	4087	B
like um	4087	B
um what did she have um like	4087	B
tickets against her um saying that the she didn't have proper food um prepared for them	4087	B
and that it was just dirty and	4087	B
and she didn't take very good care of the kids and you know you don't want to send your kids to place like that	4087	B
right	4087	B
right	4087	B
um-hum	4087	B
um-hum yeah	4087	B
right or you have to um	4087	B
it's pretty expensive i	4087	B
the college i go to they have uh child care	4087	B
um there but you still have to pay	4087	B
you know it doesn't come with them	4087	B
no i don't	4087	B
right it's like uh uh if you do work most of the money goes back into taking care of your child so	4087	B
you might as well stay home if you're married	4087	B
right	4087	B
yeah i've i've heard a lot of things about that too um	4087	B
with some people say it's not healthy for your children to be in day care	4087	B
and you know other's say it is so i don't know	4087	B
no	4087	B
yeah	4087	B
yeah	4087	B
yeah	4087	B
um-hum	4087	B
yeah that is it's a tough decision	4087	B
um-hum	4087	B
um i think it's	4087	B
for- for the students	4087	B
yeah i don't know if it would- it's it makes sense to have it for the teachers too	4087	B
but um	4087	B
um yeah my mom stayed home um she had four kids and	4087	B
she stayed home with all of us until i got into about kindergarten and then she went um back to work after	4087	B
right	4087	B
um	4087	B
for a while she was there	4087	B
um when i got home but then um and she started working later until like four and i would come home first and i and my brothers and sisters were all older than me so	4087	B
yeah um-hum yeah there was already somebody home	4087	B
yeah	4094	B
that's correct	4094	B
right uh-huh	4094	B
right	4094	B
yes i i really think that um	4094	B
there is room for that	4094	B
i feel like if anybody has committed murder and they and they convict them that they definitely and they're sentenced to life in prison then it's not fair to have us to pay for them to stay there for life and then get paroled and go back out	4094	B
i believe that if they're convicted and it's um	4094	B
you know the only scary part i see in that is a crooked law system that would put people to death without enough evidence	4094	B
to close the case do you know what i mean	4094	B
right	4094	B
well i don't think it's too uh productive to put someone in prison for a life time or like they say sometimes people get eight life sentences on top of each other	4094	B
right and um then they're repeat offenders um i went to school with one of Ted Bundy's attacked girls	4094	B
she was um older than me she was three years older but she went to the same high school as i did and we all knew when she was taken and he had been under suspicion and everything at that point	4094	B
and i think he killed her definitely uh-hum	4094	B
right um i think that in my belief i believe- we uh i believe that if a person has killed	4094	B
then there really isn't much point to them going on anyway because they pretty much ruined what they came to earth to do you know what they're here to do to try to make life um the best that they can	4094	B
i definitely no i don't think so i don't think that that's something that we should try to get excited about watching like boxing or some sport i don't agree with that and i don't even think that they need to	4094	B
have more than just a couple people in there to make sure that it's done and it should be i think it should be done as painlessly and just done as nicely as it can be	4094	B
but i don't believe in keeping all these prisoners what do you think	4094	B
right	4094	B
oh i think that there should be capital punishment even for other things i think somebody that's caught selling drugs	4094	B
if that shouldn't be capital punishment but if they're the high ones that are making these drugs and importing them i think that you could consider that because in essence they're taking lives	4094	B
because people are thinking you know what am i going to get five years if i'm caught so what's the big deal	4094	B
yep	4094	B
no	4094	B
and um	4094	B
so i- i- i think that it could go even farther than	4094	B
i think that i don't know it's hard you don't want to be so mean that you're you're doing away with people that have a chance to change	4094	B
but then i you look at the reports of people that are in prison and they act like they're reformed and then they get out and they repeat- repeat these offenses	4094	B
so	4094	B
yeah	4094	B
that's	4094	B
yeah i'm i'm a Christian also and that's why you get in the situation where um it says how i believe but if a person's committed murder that's an unpardonable sin	4094	B
and so why should we pardon something that we don't believe our our Lord- uh God is pardoning do you know what i mean	4094	B
uh uh uh capital punishment i understand means if somebody commits a serious enough crime we kill them	4094	A
is that your understanding of it	4094	A
well let me put it bluntly there's not too many things that Arabs do right but one of the things they do is have a low crime rates they don't have too many repeat offenders	4094	A
and they have uh very serious capital punishment over there	4094	A
hum-um	4094	A
hum-um hum-um	4094	A
yeah	4094	A
yeah that shouldn't- shouldn't happen but unfortunately it it can	4094	A
uh i i'm in i think we're pretty much in agreement uh in Texas this	4094	A
death by injection seems about as civilized a way as you can do it i guess	4094	A
yeah and then get out in what	4094	A
um	4094	A
hm	4094	A
he killed her	4094	A
oh my gosh	4094	A
well i was in the University of Texas years ago when one guy killed two girls in his room and hid the bodies in the field-	4094	A
and every now that was in the sixties every now and then he comes up for parole it just scary that he could actually get back out	4094	A
um-hum	4094	A
what would you think about public executions	4094	A
televised	4094	A
hm	4094	A
uh	4094	A
if if it's death let's get it over and done with uh the appeal process should be speeded up quite quickly- quite quickly they had this guy on the news that's been around since seventy six and he's cost us over four million dollars so far	4094	A
uh let's speed it up be sure it's as close to being accurate as possible and get it over and done with on the other hand it may not be capital punishment if you committed armed robbery and get caught you shouldn't be out you shouldn't serve one day and get credit for five or or ten days	4094	A
uh that- maybe off the subject but uh	4094	A
oh yeah	4094	A
um-hum	4094	A
oh i'd i	4094	A
i'd go with the ones on the street corner	4094	A
no yeah start at the bottom start pushing the ones on the street corner they'll run out of supplies	4094	A
i'm i'm cruel on that drugs have no place at all	4094	A
um	4094	A
um-hum	4094	A
right	4094	A
fairly quickly	4094	A
fairly quickly i don't have uh you know we're in so much agreement i guess i'm try to play the devil's advocate	4094	A
uh	4094	A
as a Christian i can't even be the devil's advocate- i'm a Christian and i still think there's an appropriate place for it	4094	A
uh	4094	A
um um-hum	4094	A
i have a brother-in-law that is strictly opposed to it and uh he is a uh very liberal uh	4094	A
believer in uh probation uh and convicts not being sent to prison but being sent to uh halfway houses	4094	A
okay what's your view	4080	A
what's your view	4080	A
yeah	4080	A
yeah that's true	4080	A
you know even if they give it a shot it's still going to be black market all over the place you know	4080	A
i don't know coming from Texas you're probably	4080	A
i don't know i- i shouldn't make stereo types but gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there i would think	4080	A
yeah	4080	A
oh you're just living down there	4080	A
yeah	4080	A
oh well	4080	A
yeah well	4080	A
i know how you feel i'm uh i grew up in Nebraska and and we always use to go out and hunt all the time you know and	4080	A
man there's no way there's no way i would ever go for a total ban on all weapons that's just i don't know	4080	A
yeah it doesn't sit with me very well	4080	A
i don't know i anymore i keep a thirty eight in my truck you know	4080	A
yeah i just about all well i live in Minneapolis and	4080	A
i well actually i live in Florida but i am staying in Minneapolis for a year	4080	A
and you know both areas are pretty crime ridden right now	4080	A
and it's just you you never know who is out there you know it's just for self protection purposes and then	4080	A
of course there's the hunting issue so	4080	A
yeah that's good but what do you do Jeff	4080	A
oh yeah	4080	A
all right	4080	A
yeah	4080	A
i'm uh researcher of Honeywell up here	4080	A
so uh yeah you guys uh do you get much of a chance to hunt or anything or	4080	A
yeah you know that's something i miss quite a bit	4080	A
yeah	4080	A
all right yeah my brother was uh a guide for bear and elk hunts out in Idaho for a while	4080	A
and uh really enjoyed it quite a bit but	4080	A
i don't know i guess that what the scale now is it's zero for uh	4080	A
for a complete	4080	A
that's right	4080	A
i guess i am about eight or nine	4080	A
yeah no doubt about it but uh	4080	A
yeah	4080	A
yeah if there is if there's a way you know to limit it	4080	A
to- to people that that i don't know	4080	A
they they i guess they passed a couple of uh of laws here while back in some states in terms of a waiting period	4080	A
where they you know you go to buy a hand gun and then they actually	4080	A
uh i know it's this way in Florida they have a waiting period where you buy one and that's a week	4080	A
and then they check you out and make sure you don't have a record you know and things like that i think that's a pretty good idea	4080	A
uh	4080	A
and that's i don't know	4080	A
that's not a bad idea but then again you can always get around that you could go through the black market like you say you know you always will be able to get around	4080	A
yeah it's one of those things	4080	A
but uh	4080	A
i don't know i guess	4080	A
i guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled just like	4080	A
i'm not real sure why anybody would need	4080	A
a fully automatic weapon	4080	A
you know i'm just not i think those have been pretty much you know banned altogether anyway	4080	A
it kind of takes the sport out of hunting	4080	A
you know it's like	4080	A
what can you do with that that you can't do	4080	A
in a self protection situation with like a seven or a or a or a twenty shot clip	4080	A
you know you might do the same thing	4080	A
and so it's like i don't know it- it it does it takes the sport out of it	4080	A
for me i would much rather have a bow any time	4080	A
yeah i- i like bows you know i have done some bow hunting and i uh i i get into it and i think it's more of a challenge you know	4080	A
but uh i don't know i guess it keeps the shell makers in business	4080	A
but uh i don't know	4080	A
anyway that's about where i stand	4080	A
you uh	4080	A
have you uh you eaten yet or whatever	4080	A
is it seven o'clock there	4080	A
you guys central	4080	A
oh okay	4080	A
oh it's it's not too good it's kind of rainy actually you know it's	4080	A
around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about uh i don't know ten or twenty degrees and it's been up around forty so people are	4080	A
people are whining about the rain and stuff but not not too bad about the temperature ice is starting to melt and stuff like that so	4080	A
i am just up here for the year or so and it's kind of shock to	4080	A
all right	4080	B
huh	4080	B
well	4080	B
i have a hard time thinking that they can control guns	4080	B
personally	4080	B
i mean	4080	B
that's right that's right	4080	B
yeah it is but i'm not really from	4080	B
i'm not really from Texas i just live down here now i've i've lived down here a couple years	4080	B
i'm originally- originally from Colorado but	4080	B
yeah there there uh there's a lot of hunters here	4080	B
uh-huh	4080	B
i just think i i think it's ridiculous i mean	4080	B
really	4080	B
uh-huh	4080	B
right	4080	B
right	4080	B
sure	4080	B
uh i	4080	B
i'm in uh program control for a company up here	4080	B
yeah	4080	B
we do schedules	4080	B
programs- programs schedule programs what do you do	4080	B
oh okay	4080	B
uh i haven't had a chance to do any hunting since i've been down here i don't own a shotgun but i'd like to go bird hunting	4080	B
so	4080	B
yeah uh when i was in Colorado we went	4080	B
dear and elk hunting	4080	B
you- you know quite a bit but	4080	B
one for a total ban and uh	4080	B
yeah i- i'll agree with you there	4080	B
i mean	4080	B
if they can anyway get it keep criminals from having guns which they can't	4080	B
i you know i'm not for it	4080	B
uh-huh	4080	B
uh-huh	4080	B
sure	4080	B
yeah i don't either	4080	B
yeah i fully auto but even well	4080	B
i mean a semiautomatic	4080	B
i guess that's	4080	B
yeah right	4080	B
sure	4080	B
right	4080	B
oh really	4080	B
yeah	4080	B
sure	4080	B
me too yeah i am about the same way	4080	B
yeah	4080	B
uh yeah it's about seven fifteen	4080	B
how is the weather up there	4080	B
is it	4080	B
right	4080	B
yeah	4080	B
what do you do there in Lubbock as far as uh recycling is concerned	4078	A
uh-huh	4078	A
um-hum	4078	A
oh yeah what- what would be more efficient about it what- what-	4078	A
uh-huh	4078	A
uh-huh	4078	A
uh-huh	4078	A
oh	4078	A
i see yeah i- i- i- i uh i was gonna say because_1 i know i have right here a trash can for trash and a trash can for it says paper on it you know and uh if	4078	A
if i have a if i- i printed up something that i don't need it just chunk it in the in the paper	4078	A
that's true	4078	A
hm	4078	A
certainly that's a good idea	4078	A
yeah	4078	A
uh-huh	4078	A
well um as far as TI's concerned i'm not sure um and	4078	A
uh i've heard uh you know uh in residential situations i live in a dorm and i've heard in residential situations uh like in Plano	4078	A
um that they are doing uh stuff like having recycle picked up	4078	A
where uh the city uh i guess the sanitation department uh as part of their responsibility picks up	4078	A
uh the recycled items as well you know the plastics and the paper uh and uh aluminum and um	4078	A
the only responsibility of the of the patron is to separate them and then the the uh i guess the department takes them and and does what they do with them and it doesn't cost the patron anything doesn't really cost the uh department	4078	A
right they don't pay they don't pay for the recycled items	4078	A
um-hum	4078	A
um-hum	4078	A
well what- what what kind of uh services do you have there in Lubbock as far as uh where can you take your recycle items i- i lived in Abilene for a uh i went to school there at Abilene Christian and i it was so hard to uh	4078	A
you know if you if you wanted to recycle your newspapers it was impossible	4078	A
hm	4078	A
um-hum	4078	A
um-hum	4078	A
um-hum um-hum	4078	A
um-hum	4078	A
well that's good	4078	A
yeah	4078	A
uh-huh	4078	A
do you tend to buy more recycled items that if if something uh in the pack says recycled and something else doesn't do would you tend to chose the one that does or	4078	A
um-hum	4078	A
hm	4078	A
um-hum	4078	A
sure yeah	4078	A
well you know they actually started and i assumed it was TI wide um uh they they've started putting out at least recycling bins for the paper	4078	B
uh i've you know either computer paper or different types of paper i've had some ideas on how i think they could probably do it a little um	4078	B
less expensively and accomplish the same purpose but i- i guess i need to put it on paper and turn it in	4078	B
um	4078	B
well the way they have you know they have boxes located at certain areas throughout a module or down the hall or a lot of people aren't going to get up walk out of their offices and go there	4078	B
you know where i used to work we had what we called tree boxes that's just what we called them_1	4078	B
and they were recycled cardboard they were eight and a half by eleven and you set it by your desk and you know as you got rid of a piece of paper you stuck it in there	4078	B
and when it filled up you called you know facilities whoever to come pick it up and they brought you another box so not only is it you know i think more people would take advantage of it and use it	4078	B
uh i think you save a lot of the cleaning service's time and effort and money that we're paying for them to to empty the trash cans and combine it and bundle it and things like that now when it could all be done in one step	4078	B
kind of type thing so	4078	B
right	4078	B
but	4078	B
right but somebody still has to collect all that and bundle it together and whereas if you had a box that was preset and it got full you closed the box it's already bundled it's already done for you	4078	B
so you're saving a lot of time and effort i just need to put it on paper and	4078	B
i guess recommended it to somebody and see if they think it's feasible	4078	B
so um what else do they do in the Dallas area	4078	B
uh-huh	4078	B
hm	4078	B
anything extra	4078	B
that sounds good there's i i've been wanting to put like two of three bins like right out my garage door where you know from the kitchen where	4078	B
you know you can throw cans in one or the glass in the other or the uh even uh	4078	B
there are areas that can recycle the the tin cans like your you know vegetable things come in and um	4078	B
so i i've not done that but that's kind of what i wanna set up so because we do go through aluminum cans you know that's probably the one we use most	4078	B
uh but	4078	B
find a place	4078	B
well um	4078	B
uh	4078	B
they they do have facilities for recycling the newspapers aluminum cans	4078	B
those are the two major items now we can take oil like car oil recycled oil to they have uh dump areas like at the fire departments throughout town	4078	B
um i don't know that they yet have the facilities here to do the tin cans uh i think they can do the plastics like the liter bottles things like that	4078	B
um but i- i don't know i know for sure though they have the newspaper and the aluminum can and then the oil at the fire departments	4078	B
so	4078	B
i do that i think people are becoming more aware	4078	B
you know of of the waste and you know i- i like to see you know you- you drive through Burger King now and the bags are recycled paper and you know so you know i feel like people are more aware of it or becoming more aware of it	4078	B
you know like maybe it's making an impact	4078	B
i'm not as good about searching something out like that but if i'm there and the choice is there i would probably take the recycled product	4078	B
so you know that's just where i probably need to be a little more responsible as a citizen wise you know looking or searching those out because you figure if we as the citizens do that then the manufactures and producers will start	4078	B
packaging it that way	4078	B
so um	4078	B
you know they're getting away from the styrofoam-	4078	B
oh we spend a lot of time out doors jogging bicycling uh going to the park	4013	B
um some time watching VCR movies	4013	B
um generally cheap things	4013	B
that's right	4013	B
yeah	4013	B
most of our vacations are to go and see Grandma and Grandpa we get an occasional one or two day thing but most of them_1 are going and seeing Grandma and Grandpa	4013	B
in Arizona	4013	B
yes	4013	B
oh we don't go very often for holidays generally we try to get all of our kids back home for the holidays	4013	B
and let Grandma and Grandpa come and visit us	4013	B
they range from twenty four to five	4013	B
that's right how old are your children	4013	B
i think the hardest thing for us has been is to find activities- you know leisure time activities that all of our kids can enjoy together	4013	B
with the age span that we have you know like the older kids love playing board games and that kind of thing but the young kids don't understand it	4013	B
and so they get real frustrated when we try to do that and	4013	B
yeah	4013	B
i think it's improving actually	4013	B
we had an interesting experience the other day we we have a pretty much a a routine that we spend we don't have our kids play with other kids on Sunday and we just kind of keep them_1 at home	4013	B
and our next door neighbor uh we were at a soccer game Saturday and our next door neighbor was there	4013	B
somebody came up and asked if if their daughter could spend Saturday night at their house and she said no Sundays our family day and we keep our kids at home so we can spend time with them	4013	B
and i think those kinds of things are happening a lot where we are right now i think it's gone to one extreme where the families were just all running every different direction	4013	B
and i think more people are interested in spending time with their kids now	4013	B
yeah	4013	B
i think a lot of people are panicked how kids are turning out and how things are going for kids and realizing they've got to start doing something so	4013	B
yeah	4013	B
very few	4013	B
yeah	4013	B
oh definitely when we tell people how many kids we have they look at us like we didn't have good sense but uh	4013	B
average yeah my wife and i were in Utah until i guess we were about twenty four	4013	B
and we've never been back since then but we have kids up there now so we get up occasionally	4013	B
where where in Dallas	4013	B
hum	4013	B
i don't have any idea i've never heard of it must be a little town	4013	B
yeah	4013	B
okay so you have eight children um what type of things do you do as a family to spend time together	4013	A
um-hum	4013	A
um-hum	4013	A
uh-huh yeah we know how that goes uh	4013	A
with lots of kids you don't have lots of money for recreation well that's fun so um	4013	A
let's see uh some of the things we do together as a family we like to play games a lot and	4013	A
uh you may think this is funny but one of our funnest games we like to play together is hide and seek and we just have a hoot playing hide and seek when it's dark in our house	4013	A
and that is so fun the kids just get a crack out of that	4013	A
um we like we do like to go to the park too you like your family um	4013	A
we don't do a lot of vacationing have you taken a lot of vacations together or	4013	A
uh-huh and where-	4013	A
oh	4013	A
oh now where do they live	4013	A
oh so that's a bit of a drive for you then oh so you like to go there for the holidays and	4013	A
um-hum	4013	A
oh uh-huh uh what are the ages of your kids then	4013	A
oh yeah so you have some in the nest and some out huh we have ours start at twelve and then they go down to four	4013	A
so	4013	A
i bet yeah	4013	A
um-hum yes uh-huh	4013	A
yes and then if you want to play something on the little kids' level then the older kids get real bored and and they want to and do something else so yeah i can i can relate to that	4013	A
um do you feel that the current trend in families spending time together is a positive one or a negative one	4013	A
uh-huh	4013	A
uh-huh um-hum	4013	A
um-hum	4013	A
um-hum	4013	A
that's good	4013	A
oh good	4013	A
um-hum	4013	A
i think so and i feel like you know like President Bush Bush has mentioned quite often that we are trying to become a kinder and gentler nation and it does begin with the families at home	4013	A
and so i i'm a firm believer in that too	4013	A
um yes that's that's true well we see that a lot out here in Utah and	4013	A
um so hopefully hopefully it's going to spread huh that's a good	4013	A
oh um do you have a lot of large families out there in Texas or	4013	A
very few you feel like you're in the minority	4013	A
oh dear oh well out here in Utah five is about the the average yeah	4013	A
oh	4013	A
uh-huh	4013	A
oh	4013	A
oh	4013	A
oh i have some relatives out there in Texas in fact my mom's out there in Texas right now in Dallas spending a month with her cousins on their ranch and	4013	A
well uh no i'm trying Aberdeen	4013	A
it is that close to Dallas oh don't you it's i guess- guess it's out there clear out they have a ranch it has like five hundred acres and	4013	A
uh Greg uh i'm i'm not familiar i think uh you guys in Indiana don't you have the the death penalty	4037	A
uh-huh	4037	A
uh-huh	4037	A
um-hum	4037	A
right	4037	A
um-hum	4037	A
um-hum uh i- i tend to agree with you uh i've changed my views over uh even- even within the last few years uh to be honest uh	4037	A
uh when i was in college- when i was an undergraduate i was a member of Amnesty International	4037	A
and uh of course at that time you know i thought uh how- it's it was stupid to kill anybody for uh you know that the eye for an eye was a stupid argument	4037	A
but the uh	4037	A
the more now i live in downtown Dallas and i uh you know i've seen uh i've seen cases on in the news and all where where you know uh a a	4037	A
person who had murdered a person is back on the street and then commits another murder	4037	A
i think that maybe a	4037	A
a good solution to capital punishment might be uh reserve it solely for uh repeat offenders of a crime like uh murder	4037	A
yeah uh i-	4037	A
yeah it seems sensible and and fail-safe i- uh i- i don't you know not completely fail-safe but if a man's convicted of two murders uh you know there's a pretty good chance that something's wrong	4037	A
uh	4037	A
i also uh to tell you how liberal i have turned uh toward this or or or whatever side that is i've kind of chosen uh i believe that that uh	4037	A
big time drug importers like uh say Noriega for example these- these people need to be uh eliminated uh	4037	A
from society and i think i think the death penalty is the best choice for those people because uh really any kind of uh	4037	A
uh jail sentence for them is just another chance to uh	4037	A
create another power structure	4037	A
you know the	4037	A
uh-huh	4037	A
right	4037	A
right	4037	A
right	4037	A
um-hum	4037	A
um-hum	4037	A
uh	4037	A
do you uh are there cases where you think that that uh the capital capital punishment shouldn't be uh uh sentenced	4037	A
um-hum	4037	A
right	4037	A
right	4037	A
uh-huh	4037	A
uh-huh	4037	A
right	4037	A
sure yeah i understand i understand your point	4037	A
yeah uh of course you know with uh with with Dahlmer now uh you- you realize that Ohio- i think it's Ohio uh gets to try him next and they do have the death penalty	4037	A
yeah	4037	A
so uh that was a curious case i	4037	A
uh uh that was something is sort of nightmarish to say the least	4037	A
uh well here in Texas we uh i think even even this last week	4037	A
uh last week they had another they uh you know they use their capital punishment by lethal injection uh uh	4037	A
yeah we do have the death penalty here it's not exercised very often but we do have it	4037	B
i believe it i can't even remember the last execution we had here actually	4037	B
uh personally i'm in favor of capital punishment i know there's a lot of lot of problems with it but uh	4037	B
seems to me that some crimes are just so heinous that that the person just uh i feel doesn't deserve to live doesn't deserve for the tax payers to spend however many thousands of dollars it costs a year to keep them in in prison for life	4037	B
uh i know there's a lot of problems with that like well they say okay if you declare someone put them on death row and execute them well then ten late- years later you find out that he really didn't do it then that life was wasted but	4037	B
just seems like in some cases that it's a it's a good policy	4037	B
uh-huh	4037	B
right	4037	B
right	4037	B
right	4037	B
that's a that's a thought that i had never really had on that which- which seems pretty sensible	4037	B
right	4037	B
right yeah	4037	B
uh-huh	4037	B
uh-huh	4037	B
yeah you're you're right there uh	4037	B
i just- basically my views i guess they tend to be more economically oriented in that i just	4037	B
you- you know they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand dollars taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail when they're going to be there for life they're never going to be rehabilitated	4037	B
i mean i don't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with so to me i'm paying taxes you know twenty percent of my check or whatever	4037	B
to keep somebody alive who i in my mind shouldn't be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society so i i'm all in favor of it	4037	B
well i- i really don't know on that question it just seems like for instance the Jeffrey Dahlmer case i mean i- i don't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society i hope the guy never gets back out on the streets	4037	B
and in that case Wisconsin doesn't have a death penalty so he's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment	4037	B
and i think that that he should not be allowed to live but you know then you're kind of playing God which is never- never a good thing to do but cases where i think the death penalty should be withheld	4037	B
uh not really that i can think of i i would i would be in favor of the death penalty in things like you know murders and like you said repeat murders or serial killers	4037	B
uh i don't really agree with the uh death penalty for people like Noriega and such as that i think that they're	4037	B
they're operating on a more i mean i know that they're causing massive problems in society up here but i don't really think that- that it's	4037	B
it's in our power to take these people from a sovereign state and say you don't deserve to live because they're feeding our consumer needs	4037	B
um-hum	4037	B
yeah	4037	B
yeah- yeah that is very curious	4037	B
yeah	4037	B
that's that's right	4037	B
it's recycling	4009	A
exactly i agree	4009	A
well you know i think it all depends on the consumer the more we uh demand from from the people that are producing these goods that they use recycled products the more you know innovative that they'll be	4009	A
there's not a market for it right	4009	A
yeah well uh do you have a recycling program where you live	4009	A
uh-huh do you have plastics and that kind of- kind of stuff	4009	A
uh-huh	4009	A
so this is like in- within the school	4009	A
do they have curbside recycling	4009	A
that is nice see we don't have that here it's going that direction but it hasn't come yet at least to my area and uh and i'm really anxious to uh	4009	A
get that because i mean it's terrible- it's really inconvenient for anybody to drive you know on the other side of town and bring all your- lug all that stuff you know dirty	4009	A
you know things and and so i i think that a lot more people would do it if it was you know at their door	4009	A
well it really depends on the product and the place you go some some places will will pay you and some others- others won't	4009	A
so um it depends on you know um the demand for the product that you have	4009	A
i'm on the recycling committee at work so everybody comes to me with all their questions so i try to know as much as possible	4009	A
but uh we just at work started recycling cans and um what else and paper you know office paper	4009	A
but we don't do you know we don't do plastics or glass and those are easily recycled products in a lot of cases	4009	A
but you know you know they have the little recycling triangle	4009	A
and some of those numbers in there mean that these products aren't really recyclable	4009	A
so that's kind of inconvenient as well why put recyclable if its in in seventy five percent of the recycling centers you can't recycle it	4009	A
yeah exactly	4009	A
um-hum yep well anything else	4009	A
well reduce reuse and recycle right	4009	A
that's right i try to remember them_1 i guess we've covered it	4009	A
it was nice talking to you bye-bye now	4009	A
well uh i think it's a really good thing because um	4009	B
of all the materials we use and things like cans and bottles and stuff like that it's just a complete waste uh you know make them_1 and then throw them away and bury them_1 out in a dump somewhere when you can just as easily melt them down and reuse them_1	4009	B
and uh there's a i mean there's so many products that are like that it's just too bad that they can't find more that we could recycle	4009	B
yeah you're right there but then there's things like the uh newspaper market where they try and recycle as much as they can and then they no one -will	4009	B
yeah	4009	B
or it ends up costing a lot more to recycle it than it does just to make it so	4009	B
oh yeah uh i go to Indiana University here and its real big and all the buildings are recycling bins for all kinds of materials	4009	B
yeah and also the uh well the University's really big about it they have contests in the dorms and stuff to see who can uh recycle the most stuff and-	4009	B
yeah within the school and also the city here has uh	4009	B
yeah monthly curbside recycling	4009	B
uh-huh	4009	B
right	4009	B
right	4009	B
right but then you do don't you get paid when you take your own uh	4009	B
uh-huh	4009	B
right sounds like you are an avid recycler	4009	B
are you	4009	B
uh-huh	4009	B
right yeah we do that at work too	4009	B
right	4009	B
uh-huh	4009	B
right	4009	B
well aren't there pop cans that are like that also	4009	B
because_1 they have mixed metals or something	4009	B
-well no not really	4009	B
right words to live by	4009	B
okay	4009	B
you too bye-bye	4009	B
yeah	4073	B
yeah	4073	B
well	4073	B
Dallas is talking about starting something like that too it's going to be i i don't know if it's three dollars a week i think it's three dollars a month	4073	B
is what we are going to have to pay	4073	B
uh we do recycle an awful lot of stuff here i i up until a couple of years ago i use to get paid	4073	B
maybe not a lot but i use to be able to find a place that i could get you know a penny a pound for glass and a couple of pennies a pound for plastic and	4073	B
something for the newspapers and something for the aluminum cans and	4073	B
nowadays it's like i i can't find one place that's going to take everything	4073	B
and i am trying to recycle my kitchen- my kitchen waste by building a compost pile and that's not easy either i wish i could figure out an easier way	4073	B
of	4073	B
doing that but uh	4073	B
yeah	4073	B
and they just got rid of them well Kroger's uh at least in Dallas Kroger's	4073	B
will pay for aluminum and will collect	4073	B
the glass and the plastic	4073	B
but they don't collect newspaper and they don't collect tin cans and they don't collect cardboard	4073	B
and i know that the place at Galleria there is one bin in their loading dock area that's for cardboard only and they will recycle the cardboard from there	4073	B
yeah uh	4073	B
well i use to it use to be a good deal us to give- instead of giving my kids an allowance i just told them they could go around the neighborhood and collect things to be recycled and then i would drive them over and	4073	B
they get some money and it was a good way to teach them that their work earned them	4073	B
some money and at the same time it was cleaning up the neighborhood and it was getting stuff recycled and	4073	B
but know it's just	4073	B
you know i can't do that because they don't earn any money for it and i hate to see that happen but	4073	B
you know and i would also i'd like to see the state you know they say on all sorts of things you know the they the diaper people advertise	4073	B
that diaper are recyclable and they are working on a program to recycle and well yeah in one small community they're recyclable but there is nothing around that will recycle that or recycle tires or recycle	4073	B
you know uh you know uh they say all these plastics are recyclable but nobody will take anything on beyond a two and so all the bags and all the stuff that's four or six doesn't get recycled	4073	B
well or if it has to be separated by number why doesn't someone take it i mean i can't find it's i can't even find somewhere that will take the stuff	4073	B
yeah and i i think maybe one thing that we could do to encourage it would be to require uh you know government agencies and stuff were required to use only recycled paper for instance	4073	B
and to define recycle paper as paper that includes	4073	B
you know	4073	B
material that had actually been used as paper before	4073	B
one of the things that they do is that they call stuff recycled paper like when they when they make envelopes and stuff they had what they call mill ends	4073	B
you know the little the pieces from that they cut out from making the envelopes	4073	B
well that's what they are recycling cause that never had any ink on it that's what we usually send them to recycle it never had any ink on it they don't have to clean it they put that in with with fresh wood fiber	4073	B
and they call that recycled paper	4073	B
you know well then nobody wants to buy my newspaper and nobody wants to to figure out how to	4073	B
you know how to clean up	4073	B
okay i guess we're recording now so	4073	A
i think they could uh	4073	A
uh our neighborhood they have a recycling program and you've got to pay for them to pick it up and stuff	4073	A
and then they get paid for recycling it so i don't know	4073	A
if that's very fair or not	4073	A
um	4073	A
oh	4073	A
yeah	4073	A
yeah well that's	4073	A
that's for sure	4073	A
uh	4073	A
well we we use to save all our newspapers and plastic and stuff like that and then take it to Wal-Mart because they use to have a recycling bin	4073	A
and but they got rid of them because there's a lot of people were throwing their trash and stuff in there so	4073	A
yeah	4073	A
yeah	4073	A
yeah that i always say they should have just one central place you know where you can just dump them all	4073	A
or in you know cause really i am not really looking for the the money portion of it you know i just	4073	A
oh yeah	4073	A
yeah i've heard	4073	A
yeah	4073	A
yeah	4073	A
yeah and uh and- you know and if it's recyclable why can't they just throw it in with the rest of the plastic and stuff you know it's just	4073	A
yeah	4073	A
yeah that's	4073	A
yeah	4073	A
yeah	4073	A
yeah	4073	A
yeah	4073	A
yeah	4073	A
um	4073	A
oh i guess i started it	4098	A
bust away	4098	A
oh um New York	4098	A
yeah	4098	A
uh-huh	4098	A
yeah well	4098	A
yeah i know i pay too much	4098	A
yeah i know i pay too much the reason i know this for a fact is because um	4098	A
the nature of my business is such that my income fluctuates dramatically from year to year so on the good years i pay just proportional- i'm i'm viewed as wealthy and i pay a high percentage	4098	A
and on the bad years i'm not and i pay average so i either pay average or above average i don't pay below average	4098	A
yeah yeah i'm a consultant	4098	A
you know so due to the nature of the business it um you know my base line is average and i don't get that back on the other half back	4098	A
there was that went away a few years ago	4098	A
and uh	4098	A
you know whatever- you call it i suspect that was one of those loop holes for the wealthy they closed	4098	A
but uh i don't know for sure	4098	A
um	4098	A
well i didn't say value um i'm just saying that proportionally i pay this portion in a large amount	4098	A
uh no not at the moment not at present	4098	A
um	4098	A
yeah yeah yeah	4098	A
well that's	4098	A
yeah if you're unfortunate enough not to buy a house which if your life style doesn't	4098	A
make it desirable	4098	A
yeah	4098	A
yeah yeah well unless you're up in the uh mega bucks range	4098	A
but um	4098	A
yeah yeah as far as whether you get value back for your dollar	4098	A
i think the answer to that one if if you wonder the through state of through uh Washington DC awful lot of big fancy buildings there they got paid by something	4098	A
you know	4098	A
so uh you know what's going in -has got to be a lot more -than going out if it can pay for all that stuff	4098	A
well i'm not really talking about um	4098	A
who is putting it in i'm just saying that what goes in must be a lot more than what comes out if there is left over for all these things	4098	A
in the middle	4098	A
yeah that's what i meant	4098	A
what's that	4098	A
well you know it's just uh you know pass a law print up another- billion	4098	A
and uh	4098	A
business as usual	4098	A
i'm not too familiar with that expression regressive versus what does that mean	4098	A
yeah	4098	A
right	4098	A
um-hum	4098	A
well that's the theory um	4098	A
um-hum	4098	A
yeah	4098	A
yeah well they play that game here in New York but um it working- it winds up working in very strange ways you can go to the grocery store and there's a sales tax now which is supposedly is only for necessities	4098	A
i'm sorry only- not for necessities only for non essentials and if you buy your orange juice in a paper container it's not taxed but if you buy it in a can concentrated uh concentrated then it is taxed	4098	A
so um i don't claim to understand that	4098	A
you know that's um	4098	A
and uh you know then we get into the idea of trying to modify behavior by taxing you know cranking the taxes for cigarettes and	4098	A
hope people -will stop	4098	A
yeah but you know we	4098	A
liquor yeah thing is you know you got to look- all all you got to do is take one look at the uh cocaine situation to realize that cranking the price up is not going to stop people	4098	A
hm	4098	A
hm	4098	A
right	4098	A
really	4098	A
yeah	4098	A
you know i um we get a tax here	4098	A
that um	4098	A
what do you call it uh	4098	A
oh okay_1	4098	B
so uh where you from just in general	4098	B
state	4098	B
New York okay i'm in New Jersey	4098	B
okay_1 so uh i guess we're talk about taxes uh so what do you	4098	B
you pay too much	4098	B
um-hum	4098	B
oh are you like a small business or something or	4098	B
oh okay	4098	B
isn't it their like um income averaging or something like that	4098	B
oh okay	4098	B
oh	4098	B
huh	4098	B
so why why do you think you don't get uh anything enough for your value i mean	4098	B
oh you a single	4098	B
um-hum	4098	B
uh i know singles pay more than married people	4098	B
and i'm single i know that and i pay quite a bit higher than a married person	4098	B
where if you don't happen to buy a house or something like that	4098	B
and you don't uh	4098	B
yeah that's about_1 the only uh tax uh write off you can get these days	4098	B
well yeah buy a yacht or something-	4098	B
but i guess they took away that and they're yelling and screaming about that	4098	B
um-hum yeah	4098	B
well it depends if it's you know a a regressive tax or a progressive tax	4098	B
well no yeah	4098	B
borrowed time actually could be could be borrowed time it's like	4098	B
yeah	4098	B
i don't know i- i	4098	B
uh i don't- know uh here in New Jersey we have taxes for just the necessities and i think it's uh regressive tax it's just as worse	4098	B
progressive um it's- it's like um you know a graduated tax which means you pay more money as you earn more money so you have a greater ability to pay you don't really need that extra income to survive	4098	B
you know and so the idea- idea behind that is to to you know that's why we we have higher tax rates for people who have higher income right at least supposedly-	4098	B
you know that's what progressive tax regressive tax is you can have a flat flat- percentage tax um across the board	4098	B
and even- and even tax people for things that they need to live so if you tax you can tax uh you know medicine or food and and-	4098	B
uh-huh	4098	B
um-hum	4098	B
yeah	4098	B
yeah sin taxes	4098	B
you don't need cigarettes or or um alcohol to live	4098	B
well it's to a degree if uh you know if you're addicted it's not going to matter but	4098	B
um certainly it it depends i mean here you in New Jersey you pay you pay thirteen percent tax sort of value added tax on your utilities	4098	B
so things you need to heat your home the things that drink your water you tax water it's crazy um you know you you see what you it's got to go somewhere so you got tax for that every utility's thirteen- thirteen percent	4098	B
well i don't know how you feel about drug testing but i'm dead set against it	4014	A
yeah um i think about_1 the only candidates that are out there that are you know anti antiwar on drugs or VIV war on rights is uh pretty much your Libertarian candidates which	4014	A
um i personally have some doubts as to whether any of them can get elected- elected	4014	A
um-hum	4014	A
um-hum	4014	A
uh-huh well it just i mean really seems the ridiculous because um	4014	A
the um U S Department of Labor whatever- i'm not sure might be a different agency requires um businesses to post this poster that has like minimum wage laws and a bunch of other laws and one of the things it posts is	4014	A
um on the illegality- illegality of um lie detector tests and um you know i feel that lie detector tests are	4014	A
well it means that that that there are limits there are there are definite government limits to you know how an employer can use lie detectors on its employees and i think that	4014	A
oh i mean i don't- i i agree that the lie detectors are inappropriate but i think you know that it's hard to justify being i don't understand how our government can can encourage drug testing and discourage lie detector tests because they seem like they're testing the same sort of nebulous	4014	A
character	4014	A
um-hum	4014	A
um-hum	4014	A
oh yeah	4014	A
yeah	4014	A
yeah and and you know i i agree with with a lot of people that you know claim instead of having random drug tests for continuing employment have um motor impairment tests um because you know the they they would not be any more priced- they would they would	4014	A
be similarly priced um and you know if some if some guy goes to work and he had a had a fight with his wife the night before	4014	A
and you know he has that on his mind and isn't gonna be able to function properly you know i i just as you know i'd i'd almost as much- you know- have as much uh fear of him driving the bus i'm riding than	4014	A
um-hum	4014	A
um-hum	4014	A
um-hum and also- and also on the question of you know just getting employment i'm you know i'm i'm a senior in college and i'm applying for jobs and i know i know a lot of people that are doing it also and i know some of some of which that do indulge in certain um	4014	A
non uh sanctioned um hobbies and their basic attitude toward drug testing is is just um moving away moving away from	4014	A
you know the relatively harmless drugs like marijuana which uh you know lingers for about thirty five days to things like cocaine and LSD which you know one they don't test for well LSD they don't test for and cocaine which only stays in your system for about a week	4014	A
um and i and i mean that's you know that's entirely anecdotal evidence i know a couple people you know that have moved in the direction but	4014	A
i just you know wonder you know overall what the trend is	4014	A
um-hum	4014	A
um-hum	4014	A
um-hum	4014	A
um-hum	4014	A
um-hum	4014	A
um-hum	4014	A
yeah and just the feeling that you know you the there there's	4014	A
well so we can have a conversation on on agreeing with one another today right because we keep working to see if we can find any candidates who will help us	4014	B
change the the trend that we have seem to have of interfering with people's personal life	4014	B
well that's always a problem i have to admit that that back when uh the Texas governorship	4014	B
race was going on that was the one thing that made me really pleased with Ann Richards is that she refused to get involved in discussing that whole issue	4014	B
for self incrimination self incrimination kind of thing yeah	4014	B
yeah yeah because the the tests are equally unreliable and	4014	B
personally i don't even think it's a question of whether they're reliable or not i mean it doesn't matter how reliable they are then i think that it's inappropriate you know actually i can almost understand it more for somebody who's	4014	B
getting ready to hire someone than i can allowing them to spot test or random test people who are	4014	B
currently employed because i think that current employment you know continuation of employment should be based on performance	4014	B
okay	4014	B
or maybe more well you know if you stop and think about it	4014	B
stop and think about it you can get awfully hostile and decide to to take care of the whole world one day or something yeah well you're absolutely right	4014	B
you're absolutely right uh	4014	B
uh it certainly sounds that if if that's what college students are doing that that's anti productive	4014	B
yeah	4014	B
well that of course there's really there's really no way to know uh it's	4014	B
i just you know unfortunately i've i've talked with a um	4014	B
some friends of mine who are lawyers recently about that because my husband's in a job situation that um	4014	B
makes him	4014	B
subject to this sort of thing and it makes him extremely unhappy with his work place	4014	B
and uh you know not that he does it not that he's ever done it you know i mean he's he's one of the straightest people i know which is it and it has nothing to do with	4014	B
you know with any of the rest of it he doesn't like the feeling of loss of control so he doesn't	4014	B
so he yeah so he wouldn't do it but on the other hand he also doesn't like the sense of loss of control of his personal life	4014	B
well i- i think my feelings on it are it depends i think if it's necessary if you have the kind of job that it it requires you to always be	4065	B
you know like police officers firemen doctors anybody who has you know who's important- whose decisions are important and you know that's	4065	B
that's what i think as far as you are required to not only be at work when you're not at work	4065	B
as it were you know what i'm saying if you if if	4065	B
yeah people who who could be at work at any time or whose decisions could be clouded if they had to make a decision	4065	B
when they aren't at work but i don't see the point in it if you're	4065	B
if you're putting something together down at the local pizza place or whatever	4065	B
then i'd uh i just don't see what merits you're going to have from gaining	4065	B
what you do when you're not at work in those situations is your own business i think i think that's an infringement upon your personal rights	4065	B
that's an invasion of your personal privacy that's	4065	B
if they were to decide that you shouldn't be drinking would- would they just you know i mean you- you have to draw the line somewhere i think and give people	4065	B
the right to do what they need to do what they want to do	4065	B
yes i okay i'm i'm i'm i- i think that's fine i think if you're if if it matters to you that much then	4065	B
you should you know i mean if you want to weed out those kind of people right from the start i have no problem with that because you don't you don't want somebody who's a drug user starting work for you but i don't i don't think that they can just	4065	B
or come to show up for work one day and they just say here you go i- i don't know it's kind of	4065	B
yeah it's it's really you don't	4065	B
yeah exactly	4065	B
yeah	4065	B
um-hum it's yeah it's kind of a	4065	B
do you trust me do you not trust me	4065	B
you know it's i don't know i don't- i don't know it's it's awfully it's it has it's points it's good points and it's bad points see	4065	B
it kind of makes us look like we're going in the other direction as far as the way the rest of the world's going almost	4065	B
you know i've walls are coming come in Berlin and	4065	B
we	4065	B
and here we are we're going the other way and	4065	B
yeah it does and so i don't know it's kind of a perplexing problem	4065	B
oh yeah yeah	4065	B
yeah who am i harming as long as i am doing my job yeah	4065	B
yeah	4065	B
yeah exactly you don't want your doctor coming in hung over if he's gonna be cutting on you that day that's for sure so	4065	B
uh yeah that is difficult you're gonna you can't but then that just kind of comes back to personal responsibility	4065	B
you but i guess that's more or less forcing you to be personally responsible for yourself	4065	B
it's basically all they're trying to do with that then if you want to if you look at it that way because you would think your doctor wouldn't be out drinking the night before but but if he thought he could get caught doing it then he certainly wouldn't do it as opposed to well	4065	B
it's not a big operation tomorrow what the heck or something you know-	4065	B
yeah yeah it's just a gallbladder it ain't you know no problem yeah i guess that's just- uh that's basically what they're doing then just forcing you to be responsible but i guess some people have to be forced so	4065	B
that was yeah wasn't yeah that's i don't know i- i kind of think well it's partially because we have the technology now but it's also because i think moral standards have gone downhill quite a bit since	4065	B
earlier you know i mean it's just it's just reached that point where society accepts	4065	B
you know you don't think about seeing your doctor out at a bar anymore whereas you know nineteen forty doctor so and so	4065	B
okay well how do you feel about uh drug testing uh for prospective employees	4065	A
uh-huh	4065	A
oh i see oh twenty four hour people you mean	4065	A
uh-huh	4065	A
uh-huh	4065	A
um-hum	4065	A
um-hum	4065	A
uh-huh	4065	A
would you uh would you	4065	A
do it before they were employed or would would you say random testing is also okay	4065	A
yeah	4065	A
um-hum	4065	A
yeah	4065	A
it's a hard problem isn't it because because you don't want an airline pilot on drugs	4065	A
but at the same time that's a that's a that's an embarrassing humiliating kind of test to have to take people questioning you by you know by doing that	4065	A
yeah	4065	A
yeah	4065	A
and we're and we're getting	4065	A
it does feel like it doesn't it	4065	A
i know	4065	A
well it is because when we think about it and it isn't at all reassuring	4065	A
doctors have been on drugs for years from what i hear	4065	A
you know and and uh we've uh and we have all sorts of people who've done things and i'm certainly not in favor of of any of that and yet somehow they've performed and then they say well if i did what i was suppose to do and did it	4065	A
the way i was suppose to do it then why would you you know whose business is it	4065	A
right and yet the potential like	4065	A
i don't like knowing that there might be an alcoholic who is flying my plane or or you know cutting into my body	4065	A
uh-huh	4065	A
that's right that's right	4065	A
it's only- only- only old lady so and so from where ever and	4065	A
right	4065	A
yeah it and it does it does make you wonder because i'm not sure- i was trying to think in in history have- have people checked that or did people just	4065	A
did people just	4065	A
accept the responsibility or are we able to test things now that never could be tested before so therefore we're using technology in a way that wasn't available before	4065	A
um-hum	4065	A
um-hum	4065	A
right	4065	A
all right uh	4057	A
excuse me	4057	A
yeah	4057	A
okay	4057	A
all right so uh	4057	A
yeah i	4057	A
yeah	4057	A
oh you think you- that we are paying too much	4057	A
in taxes	4057	A
um-hum	4057	A
yeah it's even higher uh tax rate over there on income	4057	A
right are- are you you're a native- you're from uh the United States	4057	A
but you worked over there for a couple of year	4057	A
yes	4057	A
right you talking about special projects in the US- in the US you mean now	4057	A
okay yeah it's true i feel that um you know i don't feel that uh we're paying too much taxes provided we get the right services for what we pay for but i think we've kind of gotten away from that	4057	A
um for what we get we're paying too much i would say	4057	A
right or if if things i didn't feel that things were wasted	4057	A
for uh you know through uh red tape through waste you know uh money- a lot of money is lost and how much effect are you getting out of your dollar and how much goes to just waste	4057	A
right right typically um	4057	A
you don't get a whole lot	4057	A
well right a lot of federal money goes for highways but speaking of um people who are on welfare i know one of the presidents Patrick Buchanan has a idea that says that	4057	A
if he's president if you don't get a job within two years then you're taken off welfare	4057	A
so to eliminate people who continuously uh kind of leech off the system	4057	A
you know you you have you get to spend your time but then you're off	4057	A
yes	4057	A
well i- i- i guess i'm not i don't like to make hard and fast rules that you have to live by because_1 there's always exceptions but i think something has to be done some type of reform measure	4057	A
uh-huh	4057	A
yeah	4057	A
right	4057	A
hm	4057	A
yes	4057	A
yeah	4057	A
um-hum	4057	A
yeah i don't know what's your situation i live uh i'm a property owner in the city limits of Atlanta	4057	A
and we get taxed tremendously- tremendously on our property taxes and a lot of that money doesn't go for what the original intent of property taxes was	4057	A
um i pay for a a local hospital uh Grady Hospital where a lot of	4057	A
indigent people are go and get free care	4057	A
and i pay for schools which you know maybe homeowners should pay for that but i- i and a lot of other things-	4057	A
did you uh did you have to wait very long	4057	B
did you have to wait very long	4057	B
oh i forgot my i i had to dig through my suitcase and find my personal identification number	4057	B
they had	4057	B
are Americans still paying too much too many taxes	4057	B
that's a that's an easy one are we supposed to spend five minutes on this	4057	B
well no i mean yes	4057	B
yeah yeah i don't think we're paying a lot too much i uh	4057	B
i think we're paying i i i used to live in Sweden and uh i know that they pay a lot more than we do	4057	B
yeah so i guess we should be grateful that it's as low as it is	4057	B
yes i i'm from Idaho actually	4057	B
yeah yeah i was- so when i was living in Sweden i got uh an impression- kind of an impression of their system which is socialistic	4057	B
and so they everything is subsidized by their government their their taxes are higher than ours so i guess i shouldn't be i shouldn't complain so much	4057	B
i uh i do get concerned that there's that there's a lot of uh government spending on things like um	4057	B
things that that don't really benefit anyone outside of the congressman's district who proposes the measure like restoring some old ship or something like that	4057	B
it	4057	B
right	4057	B
you wouldn't mind paying that much if you were getting that equivalent value for it	4057	B
i can go	4057	B
yeah i think i have to agree although i pay an awful lot of taxes because i'm single i'm in a reasonably high tax bracket	4057	B
so	4057	B
um it seems very expensive to me for what i get	4057	B
no although i get some things that i very much appreciate i mean i don't i don't have a dictator i don't i'm not reporting for a dictator i live in a free economy and so i mean in a sense i don't mind spending money on	4057	B
and uh welfare on	4057	B
reasonable amounts of welfare i don't mind spending money on	4057	B
and things like highways and stuff i don't mind spending on	4057	B
huh	4057	B
don't know if i agree with that or not	4057	B
i mean because there's people that just plain i don't know what the percentage is but there is some percentage of people out there that just cannot get a job for whatever reason	4057	B
although two years that does sound like quite a while	4057	B
i don't know what do you think of that one	4057	B
he certainly seems to be looking at the right issue	4057	B
um one thing that i've kind of been following that i i'd really i'm kind of waiting for it and i maybe after the presidential elections we'll see it and that is for President Bush to uh see if he can	4057	B
see if he can uh give the line item veto a try	4057	B
and uh apparently he's been waiting for a test case he's been waiting for quite a while	4057	B
but i think it'd be fascinating to see him try vetoing some of the one of these rider bills that's that's clearly a waste of money and to see how Congress reacts to that	4057	B
that'd be quite an exciting battle	4057	B
uh-huh	4057	B
uh-huh	4057	B
i'm Bridget	4012	A
nice to meet you	4012	A
where are you	4012	A
are you so am i where are you in Texas	4012	A
okay i'm in Lubbock	4012	A
okay are you ready for me to push one	4012	A
okay	4012	A
so what do you think about capital punishment	4012	A
uh-huh	4012	A
um-hum	4012	A
what do you think about Jeffrey Dahmer	4012	A
like not getting since they don't have it in	4012	A
yeah	4012	A
yeah	4012	A
i know because_1 it's like it's kind of like a tough call because all they do is sit in jail and the jails are overcrowded- you know it's like problem upon problem upon problem	4012	A
it's like you could put them_1 in jail for the rest of his life well all the jails are already overcrowded	4012	A
you know and they add more problems	4012	A
you know since jails are overcrowded they have to reduce you know	4012	A
time to like one third of what you're supposed to do it you know it gets kind of ridiculous	4012	A
yeah	4012	A
um-hum	4012	A
i know i i guess i could be for it and against it in some ways i mean	4012	A
i think i'm definitely for it and stuff when i think of someone like like him that killed all those people and has	4012	A
no remorse or anything you know i feel like that's the right thing to do and i guess i would have to say it would be for more circumstances you know	4012	A
uh-huh	4012	A
right	4012	A
yeah see i think that what is the point of that	4012	A
where did that come from	4012	A
yeah	4012	A
um-hum	4012	A
yeah that's true definitely true	4012	A
see why do you have any clue why that they sit on like death row that long	4012	A
see	4012	A
yeah i understand that	4012	A
it takes prolong it forever	4012	A
um-hum	4012	A
yeah	4012	A
yeah the the	4012	A
yeah	4012	A
see	4012	A
yeah it'd be easier if at least if someone was	4012	A
you know sentenced to death then if they were to have to have an appeal it should be taken care of as quickly as possible you know	4012	A
and i understand appeals take a long time and everything else but you know	4012	A
i mean they should have like	4012	A
God there's something so it'd be done faster you know because_1 then they complain about the jails and the	4012	A
this and that and this and that and people sitting on death row for like fifteen years well that's dumb	4012	A
mean- mean at least if you're going to do it do it like because_1 i mean that's like even torture kind of you know	4012	A
yeah	4012	A
hi	4012	B
i'm Paul	4012	B
pleased to meet you	4012	B
i'm in Texas	4012	B
Dallas	4012	B
oh okay	4012	B
sure anytime	4012	B
well i think it's a necessary uh	4012	B
a necessary tool that uh needs to be used uh to establish justice in some cases and to that that it if used properly	4012	B
uh i think it can be uh it would it would be a useful deterrent	4012	B
yeah well i think that	4012	B
i think there are certain	4012	B
people in society that have no redeeming	4012	B
uh worth to them and that it's it- it's a waste for society to continue to support those people those people should be	4012	B
you know disposed of	4012	B
that's right	4012	B
yeah	4012	B
that's right i mean they probably you know we	4012	B
the you know our our justice system is not designed to be either efficient or effective or just you know it it's designed	4012	B
as a set of artificial rules that you know judges and lawyers play with each other	4012	B
well it it it uh yeah but it you know the the problem is	4012	B
it when- when we administer it	4012	B
by you know i- i mean like like in Texas we have the death penalty right and they killed a guy a while back and you know he'd been in jail for twelve or fifteen years or something like that waiting	4012	B
uh you know waiting- waiting- waiting- waiting his sentence	4012	B
what- what-	4012	B
there there's no point in it i mean	4012	B
well it it's because- it's because	4012	B
you know people don't wanna recognize	4012	B
how to make you know how to how to make a punishment effective	4012	B
i mean it	4012	B
punishing the person by killing them doesn't do anybody any good	4012	B
the only reason- the only way it does some good is if it convinces- convinces somebody else that they shouldn't do something like that	4012	B
and you know if the guy waits around ten or twenty years or whatever it is you know how is that a deterrent to anybody	4012	B
because the courts require it	4012	B
i mean they they they have said that well everybody has to have certain- you know has to have the the the right to appeal well	4012	B
but not only do they have the right to appeal they must appeal and you know they the the lawyers go in there and they generate	4012	B
well they generate all kinds of possible reasons that they might be able to appeal uh you know they they're they're trying to generate	4012	B
technicalities you know things which aren't really related to whether the guy did it or not but as to whether something in the process was right or wrong	4012	B
and you know it it it doesn't work you know our whole justice system doesn't work like that	4012	B
yes that's right	4012	B
yes	4012	B
um-hum	4012	B
it is it's terrible	4012	B
oh i again i- i don't feel sorry for the for the for the victim that that's on you know for the for the criminal	4012	B
so um what do they do about recycling in Raleigh is there any public program	4045	A
um-hum	4045	A
hm	4045	A
um-hum	4045	A
yeah	4045	A
um-hum oh that	4045	A
well in Atlanta they um where i used to live they had a they had just started a program but apparently it wasn't city wide because i moved over to a different neighborhood and they didn't even- you know no one had ever heard of this	4045	A
and um the one nice thing though is i'm is i'm lucky- is i'm pretty close to downtown so um aluminum cans can be recycled just by tossing them out in your yard and the bums come around and	4045	A
um no they don't have any deposit but um you know there's a there's a thriving industry of homeless people that collect uh aluminum cans and turn them_1 in for you know recycling- the the weight in aluminum	4045	A
uh-huh	4045	A
um-hum	4045	A
yeah	4045	A
um-hum yeah i'm not sure i- i don't i think they only carry one bag when i when i've seen people out there you know	4045	A
yeah	4045	A
hm	4045	A
um-hum	4045	A
yeah yeah that seems like it would be you know very labor intensive to actually you know go through it all and pick out the different things	4045	A
um-hum	4045	A
yeah i- i mean it's you know they have the cost of the cleaning equipment to clean the bottles and	4045	A
and things like that	4045	A
um-hum	4045	A
um-hum	4045	A
um-hum	4045	A
yeah i've heard that you know a lot a lot of the you know more popular recycled materials like aluminum and um paper especially that because you know everyone's become much more environmentally conscious and you know has moved to recycle that	4045	A
their you know the the the the the systems basically has this very large backlog of of material to be recycled and and processed and apparently in a lot you know in a lot of industries	4045	A
you can't just you know take a bunch of stuff and recycle it you generally you mix it with with new material	4045	A
and that and that you know with- you know coupled with the recession that there just isn't you know the demand for you know recycled product	4045	A
um-hum	4045	A
um-hum	4045	A
um-hum	4045	A
um	4045	A
um-hum yeah yeah i think it depends on like the little number in the circle	4045	A
that they have on them but because_1 they i have a lot of friends that you know are very into recycling you know and say you know just about you know they they try and throw out as little as they can you know and and	4045	A
um-hum	4045	A
um-hum	4045	A
um-hum	4045	A
yeah they they uh get uh they regarding recycling they just gave us uh about five man about five or six months ago they passed out these um green containers to everybody in the city	4045	B
and uh they started out by just recycling newsprint and clear glass i think and or well clear glass and uh you know brownish glass and ah however no plastics oh cans was another thing that they're recycling um	4045	B
and so you know there really wasn't a lot that i could put in there anyway i just mostly had bottles um	4045	B
and it seemed like that uh plastic would would would've been very helpful to recycle well finally they started plastics but only the kind of milk bottle plastics	4045	B
how about_1 how about_1 in your area	4045	B
right	4045	B
um-hum	4045	B
do they have a deposit on them_1	4045	B
right right yeah because_1 uh in in places where there's a bottle deposit i know that if you discard anything somebody will pick it up which is a good argument in favor of deposits uh	4045	B
course uh now with Adopt-A-Highway they get rid of a lot of that anyway but i'm not sure when they do pick it up if they recycle it there uh	4045	B
yeah well i mean well yeah- yeah but i mean if you put you know i oh i see what you mean everything would be in the same bag and they would have to separate the cans from all the rest of the trash yeah	4045	B
yeah that would that would be good because_1 uh you know	4045	B
um-hum right of- of course if there's a deposit it's worth it for kids to do	4045	B
um now soft drink companies don't want that because it uh obviously it would have a negative effect on sales to some degree i don't know	4045	B
um hm i suppose yeah but that would be cheaper than getting new plastic i- i think it's just the fact it raises the price temporarily that they don't like	4045	B
it should be anyway well did you see there was an interesting article about recycling in the Wall Street Journal about three or four weeks ago	4045	B
it talked about some commodities that are being recycled uh they they they critics start recycling before there's an industry to deal with the stuff and	4045	B
i forget where it was i think it was Portland Oregon ended up burning a bunch of it it was just piling up and they had no where to put it	4045	B
hm	4045	B
um-hum	4045	B
right yeah i think that-	4045	B
yeah well i don't yeah i don't know i guess if as far as packaging materials are concerned- are concerned if uh durable goods purchases go down you need less packaging i	4045	B
i don't know how much sensitive things like soft drinks sales are to economic conditions though i- i- i- i- i expect it	4045	B
well i would expect they ought to be more sensitive than they are or something i think that's one of the things people think of cutting back on but it certainly would be a way to save money um	4045	B
but um yeah in- the- the- the article uh mentioned that it very much depend upon depended upon what kind of products you're talking about certain things and i believe clear glass is one	4045	B
there is plenty of market for they can use all they can get but it's other things	4045	B
and i think some of the plastics are are are are among those that's rather difficult to recycle- it's just to recycle them there needs to be a greater economies of scale before they become uh viable	4045	B
um-hum	4045	B
hm	4045	B
um-hum	4045	B
yeah that's right right- right um well i'm down i read somebody say he was down to uh one bag of garbage a week and that's about the same with me but i'll tell you my garbage is mostly by weight is mostly junk mail	4045	B
if i could get rid of that it wouldn't be much at all it's just that	4045	B
all right	4020	B
benefits	4020	B
yes i do i work for the school system Richardson school	4020	B
yes it is and uh retirement's one of the good benefits	4020	B
and um health care has been a mess	4020	B
and that can be with a large corporation it used to be but i think that's a mess for everybody now isn't it pretty much	4020	B
it keeps i	4020	B
yes for the best where it used to be one of your better- you know you you got the whole package with your larger companies and you didn't have that problem	4020	B
yes i think i do i've never worked for a small one so i can't tell you you know but yes i believe the benefits and the pay is much better than you would get in a smaller system	4020	B
right	4020	B
um	4020	B
um-hum	4020	B
um-hum	4020	B
um-hum	4020	B
right right	4020	B
right we do have very good resources they're excellent	4020	B
and they're	4020	B
well it's an important aspect of it i feel you know it is it it is an important aspect	4020	B
as far as um	4020	B
being having having everything available to you	4020	B
the uh counseling and the whole	4020	B
um um-hum	4020	B
right	4020	B
well probably the major one would be the medical	4020	B
i would like to change- see a better package for the money you know it- but- but i guess we all would and they keep cutting us from the you know they keep cutting from the	4020	B
medical into the dental is so expensive where we used to get it and you used to get the eyes and the whole thing and you don't get any of that any more you know it's all separate and it's all so very high if you do get it	4020	B
and that's very frustrating and it i can't imagine how the younger families do it	4020	B
yeah	4020	B
um-hum	4020	B
um-hum	4020	B
um-hum	4020	B
um-hum i was- i was just going to say the retirement is fair for teachers but my husband has retirement too and it's not good though we've had to i mean we're building our own you know	4020	B
you have to any more you can't count on companies on that any more that and that's another thing that's changed the the medical and the	4020	B
retirement benefits from large corporations it's kind of it's it's like it was set you know you were really set for life really	4020	B
uh uh-huh	4020	B
yeah yep- yep that's right- right before	4020	B
that's yeah i remember um	4020	B
my mother talking in the forties for her her father was cut you know they went through this same thing in the forties that they're doing now they were cutting men at forty five and fifty years old and that's what they're doing again it's like a recycle of the whole	4020	B
when they see they're gonna have to pay all those benefits and all or it's getting close to a time	4020	B
they bring in they bring in the younger blood that they don't have to pay as high and	4020	B
oh	4020	B
i do too and the wisdom behind it all it's yeah and you know that's got to count- that's got to add in all their production the whole works	4020	B
um-hum	4020	B
yeah	4020	B
yeah	4020	B
well it's cost again	4020	B
you know cutting costs-	4020	B
i pressed- i pressed one all right uh on uh	4020	A
benefits and um for the uh benefits of working for a large corporation	4020	A
i found the biggest i do work for one now and the biggest benefit is that uh there's a little more in backup when i need it	4020	A
do you work outside of the home	4020	A
oh	4020	A
that's a pretty large corporation	4020	A
um-hum	4020	A
oh yeah	4020	A
yeah it keeps changing because they they have to keep shopping around	4020	A
um-hum	4020	A
yeah do you like working for a large school system compared to a small one	4020	A
um-hum	4020	A
well i think uh course i'm i'm a medical technologist and and in our line of work it's awfully nice to not be out by yourself and that's the biggest benefit i find	4020	A
because_1 um you have more backup and more people to call on with problems that may arise and uh	4020	A
of course uh you know it uh it varies with the situations	4020	A
do you have good resources in your school district	4020	A
yeah to my mind that's the best thing for working for a big place	4020	A
um is how about you how do you feel about that	4020	A
um-hum	4020	A
whole ball of wax	4020	A
what would you like to change in your benefits	4020	A
um-hum	4020	A
yeah	4020	A
do you have to pay	4020	A
um-hum	4020	A
um-hum	4020	A
yeah well ours is	4020	A
well it's it's difficult	4020	A
i know uh ours has improved over what it was because_1 we just went to a larger corporation and that's what helped it improve but	4020	A
the one thing i'd like to see in our profession is our retirement benefits are almost pathetic	4020	A
so that's how i'd like to improve ours	4020	A
oh well you have to	4020	A
uh-huh you have to if you're smart	4020	A
hum-um	4020	A
um-hum	4020	A
well in the large corporations the one the thing you have to be so careful of now is being cut when you are almost at retirement age and	4020	A
yeah and that's that's kind of rough	4020	A
um-hum	4020	A
um-hum	4020	A
um-hum	4020	A
yeah	4020	A
yeah it happens	4020	A
yeah but uh course i think they're losing an awful lot of valuable expertise	4020	A
um-hum	4020	A
i used to to be in actual management and hiring and we figured it cost us probably at least a thousand dollars on each turn off and rehire	4020	A
because of all the paperwork and different departments that had to work on it	4020	A
yeah it was uh	4020	A
it's expensive and i don't know why they don't build that into it but i guess	4020	A
um-hum	4020	A
i think it's pretty good i think they should do it especially in uh in companies where	4010	B
uh you deal with uh either with other people or with uh stuff that uh	4010	B
i want to say uh	4010	B
deals directly with people's lives like hospitals and stuff	4010	B
um everywhere uh you know when uh when i was in college	4010	B
when uh everywhere i- i applied a job for uh pretty much did a drug test because_1 most of them were like defense contractors and stuff	4010	B
except uh the the last job the job i actually took	4010	B
they didn't care	4010	B
so	4010	B
it's a big company it's uh MCI telecommunications and i think uh they may require it for like the field engineers the people that actually go out you know and drive their trucks around and stuff like that uh or run the heavy machinery but they don't require it for you know the engineering positions	4010	B
yeah i was kind of surprised but	4010	B
defense contractors only want you doing it because uh they don't want you to sell drugs or buy drugs for you know for secrets or something you know	4010	B
right	4010	B
um-hum	4010	B
um-hum	4010	B
hum	4010	B
right	4010	B
um-hum	4010	B
yeah i mean	4010	B
yeah i mean i have i have no problem- i mean people complain so much you know about random drug testing and infringing their rights and all this stuff	4010	B
and you know i- i don't know i guess it's bad you know to to go inside somebody you know hand them_1 a urine sample bottle you know but uh	4010	B
right right	4010	B
right	4010	B
uh-huh	4010	B
well i mean now even if you had a false positive i mean they're they're better you can have retests or what do they do test on your hair	4010	B
they can uh	4010	B
well can't they also test your hair	4010	B
right right	4010	B
oh really	4010	B
okay well you know	4010	B
uh-huh	4010	B
uh-huh	4010	B
well they uh i mean all the places i went to you know they gave us you know small tests and stuff like that i guess if uh	4010	B
you could always get a second opinion i mean if your company	4010	B
tests positive	4010	B
i mean i- i- i would just think there was a way there'd be a way around it if i mean even if you did test positive you could probably get tested again	4010	B
and uh	4010	B
test negative	4010	B
and any way have time for that	4010	B
wouldn't it	4010	B
yeah	4010	B
um-hum	4010	B
yeah and a matter of fact i think there are too many of these dull databases going around	4010	B
yeah that's true i guess they put it in your personnel file	4010	B
yeah because_1 i i'm i'm you know	4010	B
i'm surprised they don't do it you know in uh in my organization	4010	B
but uh	4010	B
right	4010	B
uh-huh yeah	4010	B
train and also uh uh	4010	B
uh boat captains i mean not necessarily big boat captains	4010	B
but small the uh small personal boats	4010	B
they had trouble with uh not just substance abuse but uh alcohol abuse and stuff	4010	B
and they had these boat crashes and you know all these people were getting arrested and-	4010	B
and they finally said no more alcohol out there	4010	B
you know in uh like where i used to live in Virginia	4010	B
they had a lot of problems with uh with boat wrecks and involving you know alcohol related incidents and uh drug related incidents	4010	B
so they finally just said uh if we catch you we're going to take away your license and take away your boat if we have to	4010	B
so	4010	B
straightened a few people out	4010	B
um	4010	B
um-hum well you know i'm the same way	4010	B
um-hum	4010	B
um-hum um-hum	4010	B
what do you think about drug testing	4010	A
yeah yeah but	4010	A
uh-huh	4010	A
oh is that right was it a large or a small company	4010	A
uh-huh	4010	A
uh-huh	4010	A
is that right	4010	A
well sure i there's that part of it i think and	4010	A
and i think most defense contractors also have other divisions of the company	4010	A
that can also be affected by that and i think what they have to do in the interest of fairness or to keep from getting sued or something is test everybody in the company at least on a random basis in other words no matter whether you work in uh defense or	4010	A
consumer products or whatever you'd you'd have an equal chance of being tested	4010	A
i don't- i don't know i just think it's a sick thing that we've come to that i don't like the way the world's going	4010	A
well	4010	A
does it i've heard a lot of discussions about this and i guess the scariest part of it is the chance of a false positive	4010	A
and and that's what	4010	A
what really upsets a lot of people who are you know very straight and probably wouldn't ever think of using drugs but the idea that they could lose their jobs	4010	A
or in our case be forced to go to all this counseling and that sort of stuff you know just in the case of a false positive	4010	A
uh no urine	4010	A
yes they can and i think that's probably be more acceptable i believe it's more accurate	4010	A
but that's not what they're doing at my company	4010	A
no it's urine samples i haven't been tapped yet to do this	4010	A
but they certainly started out i believe with the managers and folks like that	4010	A
yeah well	4010	A
yeah i- i suppose i suppose it's	4010	A
it's just you know the whole idea of all the hassles you'd have to go through and certainly the records that would be left behind	4010	A
you know everybody has databases these days	4010	A
and they know a lot more about me than i'll ever remember i'm sure	4010	A
yeah well i'm i'm certainly certainly sure that uh any drug test results would become a part of that	4010	A
probably so	4010	A
yeah	4010	A
well i certainly believe in it for uh people like airline pilots	4010	A
or uh what seems to be more of a problem train drivers	4010	A
uh-huh	4010	A
oh sure	4010	A
oh	4010	A
yeah	4010	A
huh	4010	A
well i guess it would i guess so	4010	A
well i don't know i	4010	A
i- i really haven't sorted out all my feelings on the drug testing uh i'm totally straight would never consider using drugs	4010	A
but uh it- it sort of goes back to it's a presumption of guilt and you have to prove that you're innocent	4010	A
on the other hand uh	4010	A
okay all right	4056	B
uh-huh	4056	B
uh-huh	4056	B
uh-huh	4056	B
i- i work for the University of New Hampshire and uh	4056	B
our benefits package isn't uh isn't quite as good in in some ways uh you know overall i'm satisfied with it we don't have the vision care we do have the health care and the uh and the medical- or the dental	4056	B
uh	4056	B
no i work in i'm in a on the professional administrative and technical staff and i uh effectively i run the telephone switch at uh at the University of New Hampshire	4056	B
uh so the uh the the benefits uh probably the main thing i like about the benefits is the uh	4056	B
the uh very generous vacation time and sick time we get	4056	B
we get we get fifteen days a year sick time and uh we get twenty four days a year right from the day one when you start work you get twenty four days a year uh time off	4056	B
yeah	4056	B
right	4056	B
uh-huh	4056	B
um-hum	4056	B
well i think uh the the health care of course is is an important in has to be the single most important benefit	4056	B
and uh the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing uh	4056	B
you know i'm i'm a little disturbed about that but i think that's a national trend and i don't know that uh i don't know what the solution is to it it's bigger than just the benefits part	4056	B
uh-huh	4056	B
right	4056	B
oh yeah	4056	B
um-hum	4056	B
huh	4056	B
uh-huh	4056	B
hum	4056	B
right	4056	B
right	4056	B
um-hum	4056	B
well we have two different plans that we can subscribe to under dental uh depending and and the cost between them is very is very little i think it costs me something like five dollars a a month for the dental plan	4056	B
but it pays uh a substantial amount i mean the examinations and and uh checkups every year or every six months are free	4056	B
and uh it it covers the bulk of the dental expenses	4056	B
uh yes it is the the benefits plan is different for operating- for what we call operating staff which are	4056	B
considered to be uh clerical personnel accountants things like that as opposed to what they call the P A T staff which i belong to	4056	B
and but the main i think the health- the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody and the retirement plan but	4056	B
the main difference is in the uh the way sick time is accrued and and vacation time is accrued	4056	B
uh for the operating staff it's on a seniority it's uh you know based on how long they've worked there	4056	B
uh that determines how much uh vacation time they get	4056	B
um-hum	4056	B
uh-huh	4056	B
oh	4056	B
college programs uh belong to this T I A A uh C R E F uh retirement fund	4056	B
right and in the case of the University of New Hampshire uh	4056	B
okay should begin	4056	A
uh	4056	A
i can begin this um basically i work for Honeywell in Minneapolis	4056	A
and the the benefit program we have here is really quite good i'm i'm pretty pleased with it they cover uh just about everything vision dental medical	4056	A
uh you name it and for me this is the first job i've had where they've covered that much so i'm pretty satisfied myself	4056	A
um what's your situation	4056	A
oh	4056	A
um-hum	4056	A
are you a professor there	4056	A
oh i see okay	4056	A
oh no doubt	4056	A
right oh that's good yeah that's one of the things i guess i would change about Honeywell is uh	4056	A
i used to work with the Army Research Institute and being a uh	4056	A
a government organization you got quite a few holidays off	4056	A
but here you don't get that you maybe get two or three a year	4056	A
so it's really unless you unless you have some vacation time or some some sick leave or whatever um you kind of have to finagle your way around to get that time so	4056	A
that's that's kind of a drawback i think but uh i don't know what do you consider most important you think in terms of of the different benefits	4056	A
um-hum	4056	A
yeah	4056	A
yeah i don't know if you saw on Twenty Twenty the other night they uh they basically reviewed Oregon's plan or The Oregon Plan toward uh nationalizing health care and that kind of thing	4056	A
it's kind of an interesting plan it's kind of cold though they've essentially made up a list of uh	4056	A
oh all the different uh	4056	A
medical- medical maladies that you can have	4056	A
and they basically made a cutoff about six hundred and eighty seven and below will not be covered by by uh subsidized health care and and the ones above would	4056	A
so it's kind of like drawing this line and and if you have it great if you don't you're kind of out of luck	4056	A
but um it was an interesting show	4056	A
i think you're right i think health care is probably the the most pressing	4056	A
uh the pressing one but i'll tell you i- i- i don't mind having dental you know uh sometimes dental costs can be	4056	A
um	4056	A
just about as expensive if not more and i know historically a lot of companies i think carried dental as a rider along with the medical	4056	A
but i'm not sure that's that's widely followed any more i'm not sure how how does uh University of New Hampshire handle it	4056	A
um	4056	A
great	4056	A
is that uh let me interrupt is that the same for both uh	4056	A
professors and and also staff and administration is that generally across the board do you think or	4056	A
right	4056	A
um-hum	4056	A
uh-huh	4056	A
oh okay	4056	A
right	4056	A
yeah i'm kind of interested because_1 i'm actually that's the route i'd like to take when i finally get my degree	4056	A
is to uh is to teach in university	4056	A
i'm a doctoral student in Florida right now	4056	A
but um	4056	A
yeah that's that's interesting that's one of the things i'd like to think about is in what kind of benefits they would uh they would cover and things like that	4056	A
oh is that right	4056	A
uh do you have any recycling going on in your community	4034	A
uh-huh	4034	A
oh	4034	A
uh-huh	4034	A
so they used to pick this stuff up but just throw it away but	4034	A
oh really	4034	A
it's my impression that uh it's rare to find someone who will	4034	A
recycle magazines	4034	A
the glossy magazines yes	4034	A
uh	4034	A
and then they charge you for the service	4034	A
uh-huh	4034	A
was this something that was voted on or uh	4034	A
hum by the City Council or something	4034	A
uh-huh	4034	A
uh-huh	4034	A
um	4034	A
they'd charge for it	4034	A
whether	4034	A
you take advantage of it or not	4034	A
uh-huh	4034	A
uh-huh	4034	A
um-hum	4034	A
right	4034	A
well we have uh	4034	A
some volunteer run recycling in some towns near here uh in our own neighborhood there's a private company that comes around once a week and uh picks up recyclables they do not pick up magazines	4034	A
uh and i believe they don't pick up the plastic i think it's the two categories you talked about it's just newspapers bottles cans	4034	A
and uh cardboard	4034	A
and it used to be free	4034	A
for a few weeks then they	4034	A
sent out little flyers saying hey we still want to do this for free but we're not quite making ends meet and we'll take donations	4034	A
and i	4034	A
i'm i don't not sure if anybody really sent donations in to this private company just to be nice and i believe they're going to start charging now	4034	A
uh	4034	A
and i	4034	A
i'm not sure what we're going to do i mean it definitely diminishes the amount of trash we have to put out	4034	A
so it may work out monetarily	4034	A
okay for us to be charged for it	4034	A
uh and since they are private if they charge too much they'll people will just start throwing it in the trash	4034	A
right we pay for our trash pickup but this isn't the trash people	4034	A
this is another this is uh	4034	A
um Carl Carl's recycling	4034	A
and uh he comes around with a truck of his own so it's completely uh	4034	A
private and nonmandatory	4034	A
and people just put things out on the curb	4034	A
um he's competing with some uh	4034	A
very small scale people who go around with shopping carts about an hour before his truck comes and try to get the most valuable recyclables	4034	A
so it's uh	4034	A
um-hum	4034	A
yes yes i've heard that that yeah it's uh	4034	A
they have all this used newsprint that people don't want	4034	A
right	4034	A
uh yes we do we've started out with uh um	4034	B
all the waste haulers have uh been authorized or commanded i'll put it that way to pick up uh lots of	4034	B
different kinds of waste	4034	B
and they uh	4034	B
uh the result has been that they have increased their rates by about three times	4034	B
uh	4034	B
and uh so	4034	B
now you have all kinds of of uh things that they didn't use to pick up like magazines and uh	4034	B
various forms of of uh	4034	B
glass tin and things like that	4034	B
uh	4034	B
well no in a a long time ago you didn't uh they didn't pick up any of that and and then uh they started to pick up a few things but lately they've gone in to it in a big way and they've said the uh they have to pick up	4034	B
i think it's	4034	B
uh plastic and glass well plastic and magazines which uh in the past nobody picked up	4034	B
yes	4034	B
yes well now these so they're	4034	B
we're being charged because the rates have the trash uh pickup rates have gone up uh like i say almost by a factor of three for some people	4034	B
uh	4034	B
the City Council did it they decided that that there was	4034	B
Portland is kind of a	4034	B
ecology minded area and so they uh	4034	B
uh although there're some complaints because the	4034	B
there were volunteer agencies that would do it uh at a minimal charge and a lot of the	4034	B
the articles in the papers or the letters in the papers these days have suggested that that the waste haulers now that they have a monopoly uh	4034	B
uh	4034	B
they charge	4034	B
much more exorbitant rates than the uh than the volunteer you know you you pay to have your magazines recycled that kind of thing	4034	B
in the past they said well we we were paying far less to have our magazines recycled than we do now	4034	B
because the waste hauling uh uh companies have a monopoly now	4034	B
so they can you know it's the old thing about uh now that i have to do it uh they can	4034	B
they don't have to work very hard at at keeping costs down	4034	B
so how about your area	4034	B
of course around here we we have to pay for our trash pick up	4034	B
oh i see what you're saying	4034	B
the thing that that uh has another thing that's been in the press here has been	4034	B
that uh with the volume of recyclables coming in the the prices have dropped so that they can't even pay for the uh	4034	B
how should i say it the market can't absorb	4034	B
all of the uh	4034	B
right and certain kinds of glass uh the green glass has no market it's piling up uh	4034	B
i don't know where they get green glass i guess they get it from	4034	B
well it depends on whether i have to buy my next car before or after my children are out of the house	4086	B
we've we've gone from small cars and sports cars to station wagons and a van a mini van	4086	B
yeah	4086	B
yeah	4086	B
well well when we i guess this is talking about previous cars opposed to to next car but when we went to look for a mini van i wanted to get you know i thought it'd be nice to buy American and i went and looked at all the American ones	4086	B
so	4086	B
yeah	4086	B
uh-huh	4086	B
yeah	4086	B
yeah	4086	B
uh-huh	4086	B
yeah	4086	B
<b_aside> you have to go out of here go talk to dad <e_aside>	4086	B
yeah	4086	B
well um	4086	B
i know i've- i've always looked for mileage	4086	B
uh you know cause i figure the the better miles it gets the better but the less pollutants it's putting out cause the better job it's doing burning stuff up	4086	B
uh	4086	B
yeah doesn't that sound neat if you were gonna if you if you could afford two cars and you were going to do a lot of city driving	4086	B
<b_aside> go away from here <e_aside>	4086	B
just a minute	4086	B
<b_aside> David remove Jeffrey from my presence i'm on the telephone <e_aside>	4086	B
well my my kids oh my kids think it's great we've unfortunately our convertibles have been retired for lack- lack of time on our part to um	4086	B
to work on them but we have a Fiat- an old Fiat and an old MGB	4086	B
sitting in behind our house and the kids are convinced the older two kids are convinced that that's going to be their cars	4086	B
Jeffrey hasn't figured out yet just you know it's like who want oh Jeffrey's only three you know and the- but the other ones aren't very old either	4086	B
you know is the Mazda Miata	4086	B
it's suppposed to be	4086	B
really solid car we have a a Mazda right now	4086	B
yeah	4086	B
oh neat	4086	B
well it they have something that	4086	B
you know i there's some things i like better about my Subaru and some things i like better about the Mazda and uh you know and i'm always looking at that kind of thing at other people's cars and	4086	B
yeah it it-	4086	B
well it's not just you know but like i have one car that tells me which door is open and the other one only tells me that a door is open	4086	B
so when it only tells me that a door is open i have to get out of the car and go around slamming doors until i mean that's a nuisance that's a real pain	4086	B
yeah um and one of them_1 only has the standard full to empty gauge and the other	4086	B
okay_1	4086	A
um what do you think	4086	A
well that makes a big difference doesn't it	4086	A
it's kind of like well if they're	4086	A
right a little more domestic there	4086	A
yeah i i guess the biggest factor for me lately is American versus non American and while i'd really like to buy American	4086	A
i don't know it just it really depends on reliability for me	4086	A
uh i have a Ford right now and it's been a pretty good truck	4086	A
but some of the things are not that good about it and Ford sales have been really bad in terms of customer- uh customer service at least for me	4086	A
so it's i don't know it's- it's kind of disappointing	4086	A
but	4086	A
yeah	4086	A
yeah	4086	A
right	4086	A
well one of the good- i guess one of the good things that i have to work on is my my father he's a pharmaceutical rep and he he gets a new car about once every three years	4086	A
and he's been driving a lot of mini vans in the last like five or ten years	4086	A
and uh he generally goes with i think the Astro Van	4086	A
um it's the only one that has a standard six cylinder which is real important to him but	4086	A
i don't know i guess i guess for my next car i'd probably have to probably have to scale down to an actual car instead of a pick up starting to get into that i'm a college student right now i'm a doctoral student	4086	A
and uh i anticipate getting a full time job soon so you know probably one of those things where i really don't need the the hauling capacity much i'll be a little more stable but	4086	A
well i guess i don't know i'm i- i think i'll probably buy American but i'm just not real sure you know	4086	A
um-hum	4086	A
sure and i	4086	A
yeah	4086	A
and that opens up a whole -another can of worms i guess Ford is suppose to start out with they're gonna actually put out a line of electric cars next year in California	4086	A
you know	4086	A
yeah	4086	A
um-hum oh that'd be a definite yeah that'd be the way to go for sure i think there's no questions in in in terms of whether i would have that or not i	4086	A
sounds like your kids want to get on the conversation	4086	A
i bet they'd have something to say about buying cars huh	4086	A
yeah	4086	A
oh really	4086	A
how old are they	4086	A
oh i see	4086	A
uh-huh	4086	A
right	4086	A
yeah	4086	A
oh yeah	4086	A
yeah i've heard some good things about that car actually	4086	A
yeah	4086	A
yeah a big factor for me is is ergonomics and and in terms of control and display design that's that's what i'm going into for my degree	4086	A
and so that's that's something i really try to consider a little more heavily heavily than most people probably do but	4086	A
um-hum	4086	A
yeah	4086	A
it's amazing how much spot light it's gotten lately you know it seems like everyone that's a big concern now you know it's	4086	A
yeah	4086	A
uh-huh	4086	A
yeah	4086	A
okay	4002	B
have you done this very long	4002	B
yeah that's the same with us	4002	B
well what kind of car would you buy	4002	B
oh okay	4002	B
uh-huh	4002	B
okay	4002	B
what kind do you have now	4002	B
oh okay	4002	B
uh-huh	4002	B
yeah	4002	B
oh uh-huh	4002	B
and did you find that you like the foreign cars better than the domestic	4002	B
uh-huh	4002	B
oh really	4002	B
we've always bought American made cars mostly Oldsmobiles	4002	B
uh-huh	4002	B
yeah we've been real pleased with ours i think we've had one two three	4002	B
and most we have a Cutlass we still have a Cutlass Supreme which is like	4002	B
a seventy seven	4002	B
then we have a Cutlass Sierra and we've had a	4002	B
ninety eight	4002	B
so but i don't know we'll we're going to be in the market for a car probably in the next year and	4002	B
the financing is always something we consider you know the four percent or when they	4002	B
give good financing through the	4002	B
the motor company	4002	B
but i don't know what we're going to buy i always thought i would like to try a foreign made car but boy with all the auto workers being laid off makes me feel guilty so	4002	B
oh	4002	B
oh the	4002	B
ooh boy	4002	B
i bet it was hard to part with that	4002	B
oh	4002	B
oh yes	4002	B
oh	4002	B
okay	4002	A
uh well yeah for the last uh couple of months	4002	A
yeah	4002	A
well it's kind of hard to say uh because_1 i don't think we're going to buy another car for about three years	4002	A
we just	4002	A
bought uh a car uh last year and then bought one in eighty nine	4002	A
and uh	4002	A
wait a minute we bought one in ninety we've got three cars of all things	4002	A
so uh	4002	A
probably	4002	A
we'll be in at least a midsize four door sedan	4002	A
uh we have a a Mazda nine twenty nine	4002	A
and a Ford Crown Victoria	4002	A
and a little two seater CRX	4002	A
uh	4002	A
it's rather difficult to to project what kind of	4002	A
uh we'd	4002	A
look always look into uh consumer reports to see what kind of uh	4002	A
report or uh uh	4002	A
repair records that the various cars have	4002	A
and then of course we look into the prices	4002	A
and uh	4002	A
for- uh we're not adverse to buying along in the summer	4002	A
when	4002	A
when the cars could get to be discounted because we keep we've begun to keep them	4002	A
uh	4002	A
longer- a longer period of time uh i traded off a an eighty two Oldsmobile for the eighty nine Mazda	4002	A
so	4002	A
uh	4002	A
uh yeah yeah we we've had thirty some odd cars in our married life and	4002	A
um	4002	A
we we've had a good many foreign cars	4002	A
and uh	4002	A
they- they- uh i've been extremely we've had three Mazdas we've been extremely pleased with our Mazdas	4002	A
yeah	4002	A
yeah well we we've had uh	4002	A
let's see we had uh	4002	A
we had a uh let me think	4002	A
we had a fifty three	4002	A
and a uh	4002	A
we had uh	4002	A
two fifty threes which is a long thirty minute story uh and we had a sixty five	4002	A
and then we had this eighty two	4002	A
so we we really can't complain about Oldsmobiles	4002	A
really	4002	A
yeah	4002	A
um-hum	4002	A
um-hum	4002	A
um-hum	4002	A
um-hum	4002	A
well uh my son over in Shreveport uh sold Porsches Audis Mazdas and Volkswagons for ten years	4002	A
and that was one of the deciding factors in getting the Mazdas	4002	A
uh	4002	A
so	4002	A
uh	4002	A
the first foreign car that we had was a a seventy seven MG MGB	4002	A
was British green- racing green with real wire wheels and a hard top and a soft top	4002	A
and uh i drove it mostly	4002	A
and	4002	A
yeah it really was my husband was in the Air Force	4002	A
and we got transferred to Okinawa	4002	A
because_1 uh it was- it was great fun and then uh when we got to Okinawa bought- well we bought a second hand we uh	4002	A
we decided that uh we had that sixty- uh sixty five Oldsmobile and it and it was just too big so we we sold it to a fellow who was coming back to the States and we got a little Fiat	4002	A
uh and a and the little uh forty horse power Mazda four door sedan	4002	A
okay um Chuck do you have any pets there at your home	4019	A
and what kind do you have	4019	A
oh	4019	A
uh-huh	4019	A
uh-huh well we have a cat um he's probably	4019	A
oh a good two years old big old fat and sassy tabby	4019	A
oh uh how's the disposition of your Siamese cat	4019	A
uh-huh	4019	A
uh-huh	4019	A
well yeah he's uh he has been really aggressive at especially towards my little girl for some reason he's uh	4019	A
been so mean to her and	4019	A
we've had him for about two years and and he was so mean to her	4019	A
um right after we first got him so we had him neutered and	4019	A
yeah yeah he has a couple of times so	4019	A
but he's a very	4019	A
possessive cat he he loves my son it's his cat and he's the only one that allows him to touch him or pet him or love him	4019	A
and he's so funny he just follows my son around just like a dog	4019	A
he won't even let my son shower he meows and wants to get in the bathroom and while he showers it's so hilarious	4019	A
so he's quite a animal	4019	A
yeah	4019	A
yeah well we we did uh actually take him to the pound a couple of times you know because_1 we just couldn't have him being so	4019	A
so aggressive towards the girl but	4019	A
uh he seems to have mellowed out a little bit and we do keep our daughter away from him so	4019	A
were it not for my son the cat would not be in this house	4019	A
it is uh-huh we've we tried a dog um about_1 four years ago and we ended up with a	4019	A
oh Malamute and	4019	A
some other kind of mix anyway it was it ended up being just a huge huge dog that ate us out of house and home so	4019	A
we gave him up	4019	A
and tried	4019	A
yes uh-huh we're in a house but we're in a subdivision where we really can't allow the dog we couldn't allow him to run free so he was just chained up all the time and it was it was unfortunate	4019	A
so have you tried any other pets	4019	A
oh	4019	A
oh	4019	A
uh-huh	4019	A
oh my word	4019	A
oh my word	4019	A
and do they they just paper train it or something	4019	A
yeah well rabbits are darling that would be fun if you could get them_1 trained otherwise they're pretty smelly um	4019	A
huh-uh we don't have CNN- we don't have cable	4019	A
oh	4019	A
oh	4019	A
is that right oh	4019	A
uh	4019	A
uh-huh well that would be interesting to watch	4019	A
yes uh-huh Elton we live out here by it's by Ogden it's north of Salt Lake City Utah	4019	A
and we really love it out here it's uh	4019	A
kind of country we're we're only about ten minutes from Ogden	4019	A
so we're kind of country but not too	4019	A
not	4019	A
no huh-uh do you	4019	A
oh well see i'm getting so many calls to Texas	4019	A
oh well great yeah i've been doing it for about two weeks and uh no my	4019	A
yeah i do	4019	B
i've got a male Siamese about a year old here i live alone in an apartment and uh	4019	B
except for the cat how about you	4019	B
uh-huh	4019	B
well it's uh you know they're just uh aggressive by nature	4019	B
and uh he's been neutered and declawed so and he's an indoor cat so uh	4019	B
uh that kind of calms him down for the most part and uh	4019	B
how about yours	4019	B
huh	4019	B
and and you say you had him how long	4019	B
two years	4019	B
huh	4019	B
does he bite her enough to draw blood	4019	B
uh-huh	4019	B
yeah	4019	B
huh	4019	B
yeah	4019	B
yeah boy i guess well as long as he doesn't get too aggressive i guess with the daughter he's all right you wouldn't want him to carry her off or something	4019	B
uh-huh	4019	B
sure	4019	B
yeah yeah	4019	B
is that the only pet that you have	4019	B
well do you live you you in a house or a place where you uh	4019	B
yeah	4019	B
i see	4019	B
sure	4019	B
no no i- i live alone in an apartment and uh it's it's not that big that uh although i've heard rabbits are pretty good	4019	B
you know i- i saw something on CNN or on cable here uh	4019	B
a while ago that showed some people that had rabbits in apartments	4019	B
and in houses and they apparently uh especially when they're young when they bring them in uh	4019	B
i guess i guess yeah and i would imagine that they don't have many more than one to start with either because_1 uh	4019	B
yeah	4019	B
yep that's right	4019	B
did you see the the CNN the the dog show uh	4019	B
they	4019	B
i see well they have uh	4019	B
uh a Westminster- they call it the Westminster Dog Show uh uh i think it's in New York City at the at the Gardens there once a year live	4019	B
and they had that on last week and that's really kind of something to watch uh it's on i think two or three nights for maybe an hour or two	4019	B
and uh some of the weirdest animals you ever wanna see on there some of them_1 are really beautiful too yeah so	4019	B
yeah	4019	B
so you live in Utah do you	4019	B
goodness	4019	B
uh-huh	4019	B
uh-huh	4019	B
well	4019	B
do you all work for TI or or	4019	B
yeah yeah yeah	4019	B
this is the very first one i've i've talked to you know	4019	B
uh-huh	4019	B
do you think that that's because the uh	4044	B
because the politicians have been seduced by the the opportunity to get the vote	4044	B
uh so they've spent the money on	4044	B
on uh popular how should i say it programs that show up immediately you know like giving away uh	4044	B
uh let's see how shall i say it	4044	B
paying money to people that that uh	4044	B
uh	4044	B
it it takes years for a bridge to begin to show neglect uh whereas a temporary uh	4044	B
uh input of money can uh	4044	B
which they can never turn off by the way uh will get this guy votes	4044	B
there was	4044	B
i was just going to say there's significantly more money uh	4044	B
and we weren't a debtor nation in those days	4044	B
well	4044	B
i think two things have happened number one	4044	B
uh	4044	B
it's like uh	4044	B
pay play now pay later uh somebody's we're we're to the point now where	4044	B
where the pay later is uh is here and and uh	4044	B
when i was growing up they always warned me against borrowing money to go on a vacation because you have all year long to think about those payments and	4044	B
and it just goes by pretty fast well uh the play now pay later uh	4044	B
mentality uh sounded pretty good at the time when you when you had a fair amount of disposable income and uh	4044	B
um	4044	B
the the debt load is way up uh	4044	B
you know in the sixties	4044	B
what was the cost of tuition the cost of tuition in those days was	4044	B
was the cost of uh almost monthly rent today right	4044	B
i don't-	4044	B
yeah i mean well i'm not saying monthly rent is four thousand dollars but tuition uh i bet tuition was about a third of that uh	4044	B
you know perhaps anyway what i'm saying is that everything costs more these days uh and we've reached a point where	4044	B
where people are like i say taxes are going up uh your expenses have gone up and the perhaps the thing that's more important uh	4044	B
uh	4044	B
progressive we are now making what uh what we used to think of as only the rich made	4044	B
you know the daily the minimum wage is let's see what is it when i was a i'm	4044	B
i graduated from college in sixty one and i can remember when i graduated i hoped someday to make eighteen thousand dollars a year	4044	B
and taxes on eighteen thousand a year uh were a whole lot less than uh	4044	B
you know taxes on what- what i thought was a very good salary	4044	B
um	4044	B
are about the same as they are today only i'm making	4044	B
i guess my basic feeling is that	4044	A
as a middle income tax payer i'm not paying too much if i'm sure that i'm getting value for the dollar i mean that i guess sounds like a cliche but	4044	A
uh looking around at a a lot of the infrastructure particularly in the northeast here uh you know bridges and roads in terrible shape and	4044	A
i don't know i'm sort of overwhelmed by it all	4044	A
yeah it's entirely possible certainly anything that's been	4044	A
discussed over the the last dozen years or so or maybe even longer in terms of of tax reform or or revenue reallocation	4044	A
seems to be concerned with just that you know who's who's gonna start getting more and how fast um i kind of came of age in the	4044	A
sixties and it seemed to me seems to me that the the general attitude in the	4044	A
entire country is a lot different then than now i mean i think there was more a a general sense of prosperity	4044	A
yeah although	4044	A
my	4044	A
oh excuse me	4044	A
yeah i i've never been able to reconcile that fact which which does seem to be true with the fact that the typical middle class family	4044	A
today seems to have you know and expect some what more in terms of material possessions and vacations and what not	4044	A
but back then uh i think there is more of a sense of because there was a feeling of prosperity people did not mind paying for social programs	4044	A
for instance or public improvements and today there	4044	A
there seems to be a sort of a jealous guarding of resources by each generation	4044	A
um-hum	4044	A
yeah pretty much i mean i i paid whatever something on the order of four thousand dollars a year for	4044	A
tuition and room and board and comprehensive fee and uh for those those figures have been dwarfed today certainly	4044	A
yeah	4044	A
yeah	4044	A
hello Paul	4054	B
yeah	4054	B
yes uh-huh	4054	B
well the reliability seems to	4054	B
not be too great um	4054	B
i don't know	4054	B
i'm kind of like you i have mixed feelings but all in all i think i'm for it uh i really do um	4054	B
because we lose so much	4054	B
time and what have you with the the drug problem	4054	B
and it's just so prevalent nowadays that uh	4054	B
i think it's only fair for the uh employees or the employers to uh	4054	B
have some kind of guidelines to go by	4054	B
but like anything else this can be misused	4054	B
uh-huh	4054	B
right	4054	B
well it is in every situation that uh alcohol is	4054	B
more acceptable to people it seems than the other quote drugs but uh it can do more	4054	B
harm with the uh i don't know we just seem to have a rash of drunk driving and killings around here lately and uh	4054	B
yes yes but we aren't very uh we aren't very hard even on the you know when they're picked up for drunk driving time after time again	4054	B
this is a real problem here that they get a little slap on their wrists and there was one man here that had forty two DWI's	4054	B
and the only reason they finally came down on him he finally did kill someone	4054	B
and an innocent bystander and when looking back he had forty two convictions and yet he was still walking loose so we've got problem here with the alcohol especially that uh	4054	B
the good old	4054	B
yeah good old boy stuff you know well this is yeah this is natural this is tell me what do you expect	4054	B
yeah and i i'm afraid you know it may become that with some of these other drugs too that uh i know i have some friends whose children of uh you know it's they use cocaine	4054	B
and it's acceptable- it's becoming acceptable to them that well you know they're not	4054	B
they're not hurting anyone else and i thought where have i heard this before and i'm afraid that's what we may be	4054	B
facing in the very near future	4054	B
but uh then the work place it's just i don't know what is well we really infringing on others' rights or their	4054	B
okay well hello Frances	4054	A
um yeah i guess when i uh	4054	A
first i guess i have mixed feelings about this uh	4054	A
subject when i first heard about it um i thought it was kind of a neat way of uh	4054	A
screening uh	4054	A
uh screening for potential problems	4054	A
good way for companies to weed out people with drug problems but since then i've been hearing uh	4054	A
well i read an article in the Wall Street Journal last year that talked about um the different results that they get from uh different labs and that uh many labs will give uh false positives especially some of the	4054	A
the less expensive ones and that people have been denied employment on this basis	4054	A
yeah	4054	A
uh-huh	4054	A
yeah there's a i know some employers have had have been able to uh reduce some tremendous problems they've had with	4054	A
employee turnover health problems and accidents and theft and i understand that certain jobs like if you're driving a train or plane or something of course there'd be increased need for it	4054	A
one thing that always kind of bugged me about it was uh	4054	A
there's they most of them don't test for	4054	A
actually the number one drug problem which of course is uh alcohol abuse	4054	A
and of course that you know everybody talks about all the other drugs but uh	4054	A
i- i understand alcohol is really still the number one health problem and the number one abused drug in in our country	4054	A
so it seems kind of too bad that that one's tolerated while other ones are are of you know are the ones that they focus on	4054	A
well see now in Texas uh didn't they only recently ban open containers in in vehicles a few years ago	4054	A
oh really	4054	A
oh man	4054	A
yeah	4054	A
uh-huh	4054	A
right yeah	4054	A
yeah i expect possibly in Texas it's uh	4054	A
yeah right what else how else do you drive in your pickup down the highway	4054	A
uh-huh	4054	A
um	4054	A
uh-huh	4054	A
um-hum	4054	A
well same here	4054	A
yeah yeah	4054	A
well i can kind of see it both ways because um	4083	B
you don't want to get i guess i generally feel against it but i can see why an employer wouldn't want to have employees that are on drugs	4083	B
that could cause all kind of problems i'd would like to see it see them be able to not need to screen more than i would like to see them screening	4083	B
right i think that we ought to be employer certainly has the right to say on the application are you on drugs or something like that	4083	B
and then if they say well i'm on drugs then they say well we would like- rather have somebody that isn't on drugs	4083	B
that's right especially when they're trying to get a job and i guess everybody knows that if they're trying to get a job	4083	B
that	4083	B
if they put down that they're on drugs they're not gonna get it	4083	B
right i guess depends on the job some jobs that depend- on which public safety depends like um pilots and air traffic controllers people who drive the trains	4083	B
um things like that but i don't think SEPTA	4083	B
actually does um routine screening for their workers and that might not be a bad idea i've see a couple that look like they might be on drugs	4083	B
right	4083	B
but other well i don't know	4083	B
every job	4083	B
right i guess	4083	B
i don't know i'd would	4083	B
obviously an employer doesn't wanna have a person on drugs but if somebody's on drugs and they get into the work place it might be uh a better thing for them than to have them_1 out there on the street mugging people	4083	B
that's right	4083	B
that's right if they now behind the drug testing was something like that so that it wasn't that a person just didn't get a job that	4083	B
if they ever tested uh positive on drugs then they'd if that were the case then they'd be always unemployed	4083	B
so	4083	B
well some perhaps a program but	4083	B
i know people go into programs there with other people that have a lot of the same problems and that's in some ways good it lets them feel like they have support	4083	B
but on the other side- hand it's they need to be around people that have their lives together and aren't on drugs they need to be you know people wouldn't be getting into trouble as much if they	4083	B
especially young people here in Philadelphia	4083	B
if they had if they were so busy during the day that when they went	4083	B
um when they went home at night they were tired and they had to go to sleep	4083	B
so	4083	B
but if people are not working and they're just running around loose with nothing to do they got a lot of energy and it gets them_1 into trouble	4083	B
um-hum	4083	B
right are you in business	4083	B
uh-huh	4083	B
right more more or less for large businesses than small businesses i think mostly go on personal contacts and who knows who and what people they know would say about them	4083	B
so with thinking about my daddy and working down on the farm in South Carolina and hiring people and	4083	B
you know even at fast food restaurants and um	4083	B
field work it's	4083	B
the person doing the hiring and the supervisor going and talking to people and finding out who know what about who	4083	B
i guess it's kind of the old boy network maybe that isn't as much so in the larger cities like Philadelphia	4083	B
right	4083	B
um-hum yeah they can	4083	B
so what do you think about uh employers screening	4083	A
you know job candidates for drug drug usage	4083	A
right	4083	A
right you think it infringes on personal rights to have that type of screening	4083	A
but a lot of times people who are on drugs don't admit it	4083	A
right yeah i don't really have that much a problem with drug screening i think um	4083	A
if it's gonna effect their job performance uh i think it's reasonable for an employer to request a drug test but uh	4083	A
right	4083	A
yeah it always should be mandatory for some uh positions such as those but um	4083	A
that's true that's true you there has to be that's the that's the key i think is is what happens when you find a person who is on drugs you got to just that's when you have to be careful you know you just can't	4083	A
fire every person something needs to be done to help these kind of these people	4083	A
right they can go and	4083	A
right there should be some sort of program they can go into to try to clean themselves up and be given a second chance	4083	A
um-hum	4083	A
true	4083	A
right	4083	A
right	4083	A
right yeah	4083	A
that's true yeah	4083	A
i don't know i'm thinking if from my perspective let's say you owned a business um you would want to have the opportunity to screen any uh candidate for a job within your own company	4083	A
and if you put yourself in that situation you don't want to hire someone who's on cocaine	4083	A
no but i i could it's something i may do eventually so um from that perspective i can i'd see the need for drug testing	4083	A
um-hum	4083	A
right	4083	A
well uh	4083	A
right yeah you can't really do that you could be hiring someone for uh uh a managerial white collar position in your company and uh the person can appear very	4083	A
well qualified and and perfectly normal but uh they may be having a lot more problems	4083	A
okay how do you keep up with current events	4072	A
yeah what what channel do you watch or what station	4072	A
that's the one i watch i usually keep up with TV	4072	A
i don't i am a student so i really don't have much time to like read the newspapers and stuff	4072	A
so i get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which is really isn't	4072	A
too great sometimes	4072	A
yeah the radio doesn't really have much	4072	A
news sometimes the stations i listen to are just mainly music	4072	A
yeah do you think that TV is um pretty accurate i mean sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized or	4072	A
yeah	4072	A
yeah it's they mainly go with like popular topics just not like basic news	4072	A
huh	4072	A
yeah	4072	A
going they're looks like they're going more for ratings than for	4072	A
you know actual news	4072	A
i think you know the	4072	A
probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers	4072	A
they	4072	A
typically have a better i am from a small town too here in Texas	4072	A
and so that then like local news is really who grew the biggest tomato and	4072	A
yeah farm report and oil reports	4072	A
that's pretty pretty sad or who killed who	4072	A
yeah	4072	A
well in um in Dallas um i don't know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into Luby's	4072	A
and the story was uh	4072	A
yeah and the news covered it	4072	A
right you know hours after it happened and they were taping people who were crying who	4072	A
had everything and then like three days later this	4072	A
local news station was using as a as their promo	4072	A
to promote themselves i just thought that was really	4072	A
that's kind of cold	4072	A
yeah and it was just they were showing like these dead people and they were showing people crying i mean just taking advantage of you know	4072	A
it real personal moment	4072	A
yeah it didn't seem like there was like much coverage of the story but just the play on people's emotions	4072	A
it's just gotten so i mean	4072	A
somewhere there's it's lost a lot of the quality that they use to have like in Walter Cronkite days you know	4072	A
and everything	4072	A
yeah	4072	A
yeah	4072	A
yeah what did you think of the coverage of the war	4072	A
did you	4072	A
yeah	4072	A
they kept just showing you know how great we were doing and it never really showed what actually	4072	A
the damage that really happened that's	4072	A
a lot of times like the news coverage showed all the you know guys who didn't get hurt coming home and all the big parties and they kind of you know	4072	A
if they were going to show that why didn't they show the guys who you know	4072	A
got really hurt and everything and	4072	A
um well actually usually um in the mornings i am getting ready to either to go to work um usually catch the news in the morning	4072	B
uh NBC	4072	B
um-hum	4072	B
yeah	4072	B
yeah i usually tend to just you know rely on you know TV um again you know just through the grapevine just just to know like	4072	B
yeah what what today's stories are and i usually like go out an buy a newspaper if you know i'm interested in any particular one	4072	B
yeah i think you you pretty much have to listen to like an all news station to get any news at all	4072	B
well i- i really don't like about TV especially local news as compared to like national news is just	4072	B
um it seems it seems like everything is very spoon feed	4072	B
and you know it's	4072	B
it's more like the news shows is now is- is now you know an entertainment show like a sitcom	4072	B
or like the news because they would always have you know the the wonderful investigative reports you know is is you're kids bus driver smoking crack on the way to school you know	4072	B
um-hum	4072	B
yeah also also i have the observation with um	4072	B
with the press is that like any any stories that	4072	B
i had any first hand knowledge of that i see in the press you know which only happened like ten times in my life	4072	B
you know first thing you know for anything of you know or anything that actually had had	4072	B
more than just a blurb about it that the press has managed to just mess up some aspect of the story	4072	B
it's something wrong	4072	B
um-hum	4072	B
um-hum	4072	B
um-hum	4072	B
yeah the farm report	4072	B
um-hum	4072	B
um-hum	4072	B
yeah also i have um founded like in	4072	B
newspapers probably aren't as bad as television but i just you know	4072	B
read the story and just found it so incredibly watered down and	4072	B
was that like he like started shooting people people in this cafeteria or something	4072	B
um-hum	4072	B
um-hum	4072	B
um-hum	4072	B
oh yeah i have seen that happen lots of times you know	4072	B
you know Channel X gives you the best coverage you know we were on the scene with our team players you know	4072	B
um-hum	4072	B
uh-huh	4072	B
uh-huh	4072	B
they are trying to get the you know most emotional response for	4072	B
yeah	4072	B
yeah i have	4072	B
you know i've pretty much stopped watching local news totally you know	4072	B
um you know even the national news i just find it to be you know	4072	B
very watered down very	4072	B
um	4072	B
i found- i found it very one sided	4072	B
um	4072	B
you know i mean it just it just seemed to lack any sort of debate	4072	B
um you know you know not saying that we should- that we that we definitely should have been there or we shouldn't have been there but it just seemed like you know	4072	B
um-hum	4072	B
um-hum	4072	B
um-hum	4072	B
um-hum	4072	B
yeah and i really think that you know in the in the involvement that	4072	B
the press states you know that the the military basically sets the press	4072	B
ready	2732	A
social changes	2732	A
well whatever whatever i guess you want to whether things changed over the last uh twenty years	2732	A
all right good enough here we go	2732	A
well uh let's see i guess some of the some of the things uh civil rights have come a long way i guess in the last twenty years	2732	A
yeah	2732	A
yeah that's true	2732	A
yeah and i guess i guess uh women's rights have come with that too i guess so that's uh	2732	A
probably not	2732	A
um-hum um-hum	2732	A
yeah	2732	A
yeah	2732	A
that's true	2732	A
yeah	2732	A
that's right what's i guess uh part of that was that uh twenty twenty five years ago Japan wasn't uh hello	2732	A
okay that twenty twenty five years ago that Japan wasn't uh wasn't what it is now so that that's probably caused some changes	2732	A
um-hum	2732	A
oh yeah like uh like the old Subarus and uh the old old Datsuns	2732	A
um-hum	2732	A
uh no we don't as a matter of fact	2732	A
yeah yeah and uh	2732	A
but uh what else what else has changed oh i guess uh Watergate was in there so i guess politics- politics in general has kind of kind of gone downhill	2732	A
in the last because_1 i can- i can remember maybe before Nixon that uh	2732	A
the presidents were really up on a pedestal	2732	A
yeah or else we or else we know about it now one or the other	2732	A
yeah	2732	A
um-hum	2732	A
yeah	2732	A
no no i there's no easy answer that's for sure or else they would've uh done something by now i guess	2732	A
but uh	2732	A
and probably the only other thing i can think of in the last uh oh twenty years or so i guess is that uh family structures have changed a lot	2732	A
um-hum that's true	2732	A
yeah	2732	A
yeah it doesn't seem the norm to have uh have parents and and uh the two what two point five kids and all that uh	2732	A
yeah	2732	A
true	2732	A
yeah	2732	A
but it it it's sad that we're we're losing the grandparents and the uncles that that family- you know beyond that families don't seem to get close anymore	2732	A
and that's probably got something to do with what you're saying about the migratory	2732	A
yeah	2732	A
yeah yeah	2732	A
i- i think you're right i- i think that's uh very rare anymore that uh definitely people aren't at family reunions on a regular basis and uh and a lot of them_1 i guess don't do it at all so	2732	A
because_1 i know it's been a long long time since our family ever did anything like that so	2732	A
that's true	2732	A
um-hum	2732	A
it's it's it's easier to to fight i guess when you can find them i remember that was the the problem back then you just couldn't find them	2732	A
yeah i mean uh not not	2732	A
uh-huh	2732	A
um-hum	2732	A
um-hum	2732	A
um-hum overpower them_1	2732	A
well it's probably because_1 it lasted so long you know i guess it's	2732	A
yeah	2732	A
um-hum	2732	A
um-hum yeah	2732	A
um-hum	2732	A
um-hum	2732	A
yeah	2732	A
more of a	2732	A
more information processing yeah	2732	A
um-hum	2732	A
yeah	2732	A
no that's true that's true over the last uh twenty years that's uh that's a definite change and it's only going to only going to get worse i guess in the near future	2732	A
it's going to be more rapid i guess	2732	A
um-hum	2732	A
um-hum	2732	A
um-hum	2732	A
yeah	2732	A
um-hum	2732	A
um-hum	2732	A
um-hum	2732	A
or electrical engineering probably yeah	2732	A
um-hum	2732	A
okay uh what what what what exactly we're talking about uh industries trends everything	2732	B
okay	2732	B
all right we'll start twenty years back and come forward how's that sound	2732	B
all right	2732	B
well yeah i think they have i- i really do and it's it's no longer the issue it once was and i'm kind of glad least i- i hope that's a good sign that uh	2732	B
uh the times have changed uh more- to the more equitable at least	2732	B
uh yeah i think they have too i don't think women's rights have come as far	2732	B
uh i- i think that uh in general women would feel like they still sort of getting the bum deal	2732	B
compared to uh say some of the minority groups	2732	B
uh i know my wife would	2732	B
yeah but uh i don't know uh seems like we come uh a long ways in terms of the economies of of things uh	2732	B
if i recall back in the sixties we didn't tend to run a debt all the time but we did run a debt a lot with the great society a lot seventies and so forth	2732	B
and then uh it looked like we just stayed in some sort of a economic- economic- economic morass ever since	2732	B
hello we're there	2732	B
right i can remember-	2732	B
yeah i can remember in the late sixties early seventies you couldn't even uh hardly find a Japanese car around	2732	B
and uh what few there were around were very ugly looking things must've been	2732	B
yeah yeah they must've been pretty reliable though because some of them_1 they built up a fairly good following and it appears that's the case do you own any kind of foreign car	2732	B
i don't either i've always just uh i don't know whether you call it buy American it's just that i've always bought Fords and i guess i'll just keep buying Fords	2732	B
uh but	2732	B
well	2732	B
some of the ethical aspects of political life certainly seem to have gone downhill and certain	2732	B
yeah in certain respects i feel like that the uh	2732	B
uh Reagan administration coming right off the Carter administration did tend to bring back a more aggressive uh	2732	B
uh aspect to the human rights issues and the sort of things that democracy in this country has really stood for and and you know and uh brought it back to the limelight compared to the sixties and seventies	2732	B
and i think that was a positive uh positive thing but it seems like uh	2732	B
uh with all that uh we never seem to be able to get our house in order when it comes to the economic things i- i bring this back to that at least uh it seems like we still continue to run uh	2732	B
uh heavy uh indebted- indebted budgets and the like i don't see any real way out of it either i might add	2732	B
yeah well	2732	B
yeah yeah i think that's true	2732	B
yeah i think they have too seems like that uh the country's might- been more uh migratory	2732	B
and family- the the old family structure of the mothers and the grandmothers and the grandfathers maybe even some great grandparents occasionally that seems to have been broken apart pretty pretty well including the family structure as a unit itself	2732	B
yeah well i hope that's not right i do i do hear these statistics same as you do and uh and uh i- i- i always felt like at least the immediate family unit mother father and children	2732	B
was a cohesive structure that was healthy and was a integral part of what made this country	2732	B
i don't know sort of a stable country in terms of discipline uh uh i don't know some not necessary discipline but certain- social order that's it and i- i	2732	B
yeah yeah yeah	2732	B
yeah in my my family i know most of us are Southerners just happen to be living up in Maryland though but my family uh we're	2732	B
we sort of like our roots and like to get back and have family reunions and all that	2732	B
and i think that may not be the norm for some- a lot of people as much as it is for us that don't want to do that	2732	B
yeah yeah	2732	B
yeah	2732	B
i must say too it seems like the whole flavor of uh war has changed considerably when you look at back at the Vietnam era	2732	B
and what all we went through there in terms of what's happened in the Iraqi situation it seems like uh we have uh made uh uh uh a a rather	2732	B
uh major about face in terms of the way we conduct war and the way we we uh can technologically uh uh carry out a war	2732	B
they're a little hard to hide in that desert	2732	B
well uh then too i think the philosophy is changed i was just reading tonight in the one of the news magazines that you can take you know i- i- i take Newsweek Time and US News and World- World Report all three as a matter of fact	2732	B
and uh i was just reading in one of the uh the those news magazines that uh there's a um	2732	B
a movement among certain members of the military establishment the upper hierarchy uh uh uh officer staff	2732	B
to uh change the kind of way we conducted war in the past in terms of uh instead of meeting the enemy- the enemy sort of head on instead of doing more feinting and and and and technologically appropriate tactics like these smart bombs and things like that doing more	2732	B
more smart things that are very damaging getting in getting out uh making end runs allowing more creativity at the lower echelon levels for people to slip in slip out and do things	2732	B
than uh has been the case in the past where the idea was to meet your enemy sort of head on and the like and i think politically we've changed a lot i think in the Vietnam war	2732	B
uh we we Congress got too much involved in in trying to manage the war	2732	B
yeah and that that's absolutely the wrong way to to go to conduct a war in my opinion when you when you're in a war right or wrong you should let the military establishment handle it and and and give them the job that they're paid and supposedly skilled at doing	2732	B
and let them get on with it instead of tying their hands which i felt like was not the case in the Vietnam war but was entirely the opposite in the case of the Iraqi war	2732	B
where they more or less gave it to Schwartzkopf and and the rest of the military units and just says hey look handle it and they did	2732	B
and i think the military proved itself competent to do exactly what it's paid to do and uh it just goes to give me a a a feeling that uh we did some things wrong	2732	B
i think in the Vietnam era uh and that uh Congress should have stayed out of it much as possible	2732	B
but uh that i see as a change and then industrially going back uh i- i think uh uh industrially we've changed i think we've come through an era of the last thirty years or so twenty ten of a uh a	2732	B
a nation that was industrially oriented towards uh manufacturing type industries and i think now we seeing ourselves transitioning into a more technological electronics age where it's	2732	B
information and communication and and computers that is really our next industrial revolution	2732	B
and uh you know it wouldn't surprise me the least little bit if we didn't see the whole idea of manufacture of automobiles and the like except to some degree we have to keep a little bit of expertise in the house that being a base export to third world countries and you may find- might find even Japan and	2732	B
and uh uh major powers like uh the the British and the central European economies being less and less dependent upon that kind of industry	2732	B
uh because it's uh somewhat labor intensive even if they start robotizing it uh i- i- i i'm concerned that that would be the case instead the more	2732	B
uh advanced nations would tend to get more computerized more telecommunication oriented and the like and information is is getting to be uh sort of the thing	2732	B
i- i- i think i don't know	2732	B
um-hum yeah i- i think i- i- i- i think we're made some mistakes too for example- i think the education system in this country has not really kept abreast of what's going on industrially	2732	B
and uh i'll give you an example i was talking about i've said for years because_1 i- i my background's in physics and uh i've said for years that the education system in this country has not reacted	2732	B
to what is the actual uh uh uh industrial evolutionary state of the country and by that i mean when i was going to school you got your basic sciences	2732	B
and uh that was pretty much about it	2732	B
and uh when i got out of school i had to sort of teach myself everything i've learned uh about computers and programming and and just you know the whole bit hardware in general relative to why you can do things with data acquisition process and the like	2732	B
and uh when i was going to school you had to have mathematics if you were in engineering or science or any of the other scientific fields chemistry and biology and the like	2732	B
but you never had to have computers and even to this date in colleges it's not required to take computer courses if you're in in the engineering or the science fields	2732	B
unless you're a computer scientist or or or someone in that area and then it is required of course because it's part of the curriculum and uh just as we have to take at least a year of English in in in colleges and a year of some sort of social study	2732	B
i think that it should be required in college in a in a uh uh science curriculum i even think in liberal arts this day and time it should be required you have to have a year of some sort of computer-	2732	B
no	2781	A
you sound like some guy i talked to yesterday	2781	A
you sound like the same person i talked to yesterday	2781	A
i don't know	2781	A
okay	2781	A
well so was i	2781	A
okay well have your opinions changed in the last twenty four hours	2781	A
no	2781	A
ooh gross	2781	A
oh definitely	2781	A
i mean polyester- especially in this climate polyester just doesn't work too well	2781	A
uh-huh	2781	A
yeah it's always yeah it seems like it's always cold inside	2781	A
and part of my problem is that i'm in and out a lot because	2781	A
yeah we've got a lot of buildings downtown and i have to go to a lot of meetings in different buildings	2781	A
and so i'm in and out of the air-conditioning and you know like i said we have to wear suits and that's	2781	A
you know it it gets to be quite uncomfortable at times	2781	A
huh	2781	A
uh-huh	2781	A
is that right	2781	A
oh definitely- yeah i mean	2781	A
i haven't heard that	2781	A
the last thing i heard about fashion i think i mentioned it yesterday was that wide ties were coming back	2781	A
i don't know	2781	A
i think i always run a little bit behind It takes me awhile to get used to	2781	A
oh i wouldn't wear slacks to work	2781	A
um people don't where i work i mean it's just not done	2781	A
at all but now i have worked places where they do and even then i still didn't	2781	A
i don't have a teenager i have a six year old and he's still	2781	A
he's still at the age where i can dress him how i want to	2781	A
yeah	2781	A
well i have a girlfriend who has a daughter that's a teenager and every year before school starts she has me take her shopping for clothes because they fight too much	2781	A
well i just read something in fact i think it was today about how the public a lot of private or a lot of the public schools now are going to uniforms	2781	A
yeah	2781	A
because uh they feel like there's too much competition in the clothing and it it clearly defines you know class	2781	A
lines in where you know the the Guess jeans and the	2781	A
you know stuff as opposed to the people who can't and so it takes people's concentration- the thought behind it is that people won't concentrate or worry about what they're wearing what everybody else is wearing and it will take their mind off that	2781	A
and you know enable them to you know study better plus they say-	2781	A
this was they weren't talking about it wasn't talking about actually i i kind of like that idea and i had my son in private school where they do wear uniforms and uh i i really like that	2781	A
huh	2781	A
that is yeah	2781	A
yeah i think well i think for a while kids were dressing nicer in colleges but um nowadays uh i i still i take classes at UTD and they um you know they wear jeans	2781	A
and sometimes they don't even have shoes on	2781	A
uh-huh	2781	A
yeah	2781	A
do you spend a lot of money on clothes for work	2781	A
you know i think and and this may be totally unfair and unfounded but it seems to me like	2781	A
women have to spend more money on clothes for work then men do because men can have a few suits	2781	A
and you know a bunch of different shirts and some different ties but you know women practically have to have you know a whole bunch of different suits	2781	A
yeah	2781	A
and then of course you know accessories you know shoes and hose and earrings and you know all that stuff	2781	A
um it's just i it's outrageous you know because you know you still spend two three hundred dollars on a suit	2781	A
no i ultimate leave and i haven't been at work in awhile so i i don't really know	2781	A
you know from what i i went to a concert earlier this week and saw some people and just noticed how there's a lot of the wider ties	2781	A
but they're not they're not the same as the wide	2781	A
do you think it has anything to do with the ages of people	2781	A
uh are you a TIer	2781	B
okay well we might have a difference uh to talk about on clothing uh	2781	B
what	2781	B
i am how come we got the same conversation- subject	2781	B
i was amazed that they had the same subject on clothing too i never have had that before i noticed it on the weekends occasionally when i call	2781	B
and how could they possibly get the same person that's ridiculous	2781	B
no no they sure haven't what other aspects i'm i i'm this is funny you know uh clothing let's see	2781	B
uh	2781	B
i was curious you know if they just want to talk about the words of uh related to clothing that polyester was coming back have you heard that uh i saw it on the TV that the models were	2781	B
they had a new kind of polyester uh whether that they just like to switch materials	2781	B
uh periodically i don't know we might i haven't we didn't talk about materials i	2781	B
i prefer you know the cotton with very little in fact when i look for	2781	B
uh i i try to go for the cottons and i don't know that polyester will although men's shirts are half-and-half or sixty forty or whatever	2781	B
yeah	2781	B
i uh i'm originally from the east and i we used to wear sweaters and things and sweaters are	2781	B
this isn't necessarily sweater country	2781	B
uh you know i i guess they're not as popular as they were i don't know about how women if you do you have problems with air-conditioning or were you you were uh	2781	B
uh is that a factor	2781	B
that's very bad yeah	2781	B
yeah	2781	B
at TI i am too in and out and well of course we don't wear ties and jackets certainly not in this kind of weather the the jackets	2781	B
they don't disappear but they- you know they're they're on a hook usually the vice president's or the manager's and again i used to wear them but i don't i don't bother with it right now	2781	B
yeah that is a problem uh	2781	B
where did i see an article about where they're about that subject where they're trying to	2781	B
have	2781	B
oh i know it was lunchrooms where they're trying to encourage people to stay at work and so that's why they even downtown this might be applicable	2781	B
where they're trying to have restaurants within walking distance but at the same time in other words you go down in a subway or whatever	2781	B
and go to lunch and they say that's so much more healthy for you than going out in the street in the open traffic and going to lunch you'd be better of	2781	B
i'm sure- maybe you do have some tunnels down there	2781	B
and they they say that's so much more healthy for you to you know when you have to go out or go to lunch or whatever it's to to walk or however and get to a place that is uh you don't have to go in and out of the of the temperature	2781	B
whether that affects how you dress i can imagine uh	2781	B
right yeah i uh	2781	B
well i- i'm for colorful things and i sure i i do enjoy the uh the newer products along those lines	2781	B
what do you think about women and wearing slacks and all that we haven't talked about that	2781	B
okay	2781	B
yeah	2781	B
do you have children i might comment on teenagers how they dress	2781	B
oh you have a lot to experience i have two	2781	B
right well have the opposite then i have uh well one of they're almost now teenagers at one twenty almost twenty and one almost sixteen	2781	B
and i learned early on being surrounded by women here that the	2781	B
i i love to take them shopping but i don't pick anything out you know i i just kind of influence but uh the the teen the junior high teenagers really	2781	B
i don't know if you can describe how they dress you know you you	2781	B
i i know what angle that we can talk about here we they want us to talk about clothes around work but uh the way kids in school should dress and	2781	B
i'll give you my opinion- i don't think that the school should just kind of let the kids dress what is the current style not that it's totally ridiculous of course but	2781	B
public schools oh i didn't hear that yet	2781	B
right	2781	B
well well whoever said that in my opinion doesn't have any teenagers who didn't grow they won't do that they'll never pass it that will be like	2781	B
right	2781	B
uh-huh	2781	B
i can uh of course i went to school you know a hundred years ago in college and uh we did wear ties and jackets and this was they have since changed it was an engineering school a city	2781	B
it was in an downtown area like i don't know well you can't compare anything around here to the school in like no UTA here is in Arlington it's not exactly downtown- but i guess like that	2781	B
and they just historically since it was in the city they wanted us to wear jackets and ties and i did my whole college career which is i guess terribly unusual	2781	B
we wore jackets and ties for four years and i so subsequently i wanted to get a masters degree in in after i got out of the service and uh they changed drafts so there was a	2781	B
the styles have certainly changed to where i guess my campus now looks like typical uh college campus i guess	2781	B
huh	2781	B
the older i get the more- more open to other people's ideas uh you cannot be you have to let them come out with uh whatever they	2781	B
not whatever but some of their ideas too and so you kind of back off and see what people and i know their clothing is changing you know all the time and i'm i'm certainly open	2781	B
to how you should dress uh now of course the subject is work uh or clothes really i guess uh	2781	B
uh and the only- again the one thing i am at at work is is certainly a professional look but i'm not saying that that will not change- the professional look will look differently from year to year perhaps	2781	B
no i really don't it's uh uh	2781	B
go through a lot of shirts and think no i don't really	2781	B
uh-huh	2781	B
right	2781	B
well you're sure right there because not even when i wore a jacket and a lot of the guys when i was up at Spring Creek in uh Plano	2781	B
uh we think he just brought the same jacket even that wasn't a that's not a black mark against the man and you're right that uh women are expected to look more everything matches i guess	2781	B
right	2781	B
right	2781	B
your work without saying much about it do they ever bring the subject up of asking your opinion on on whether you want things to change on how you dress or	2781	B
are the ties	2781	B
oh	2781	B
uh-huh	2781	B
right	2781	B
uh-huh uh	2781	B
TI has several locations	2781	B
different sites have a little bit different dress- dress like i said at Spring Creek it was definitely more formal i think because it was newer and uh type and many many more people wore there was very there was very few production areas	2781	B
uh that-	2781	B
okay do you have any um ideas on universal health insurance do you have any strong opinions you do	2716	A
uh-hum	2716	A
yeah	2716	A
right	2716	A
yeah yeah yeah i feel like there should be some kind coverage made but i i am really leery of um	2716	A
kind of a government administrative health insurance or medical plan because i just feel like everything the government takes over is just going to be run much poorly and it's going to be about six times more expensive as what	2716	A
yeah uh-huh	2716	A
right and they have that in England too but i think it is a pretty poor- they get a lot lower quality care than we do now i know that some people don't agree with me but	2716	A
um i know you have to wait real long time to get for certain surgeries that aren't emergencies and you do have the kind of choices that we have here	2716	A
and um i've worked a lot in doctor's offices and hospitals and i really don't want to give up having those choices	2716	A
because_1 i think i mean there is a night and day difference between good doctors and bad doctors and good hospitals and bad doctors- hospitals and	2716	A
and in England at least at the time i was familiar with it about ten years ago they just told you what day you had to show up and where you had to show up and who your doctor was going to be	2716	A
no no i mean that yeah	2716	A
it's getting worse isn't it yeah	2716	A
right right uh-huh	2716	A
right that's exactly the problem there's just so many such variation in it but you see i guess what- what they had in England and i guess in Canada is socialized medicine so maybe that's like the extreme of it do you think yeah	2716	A
uh-hum uh-hum	2716	A
right right	2716	A
really want to right	2716	A
right or that yeah exactly or people also get the feeling that well geez you know you do have to worry about you have a lot of job security there	2716	A
and it's more of a seniority i would imagine kind of thing instead of having a skill or or whatever to advance and so you don't necessarily get the kind of quality control or the kind of	2716	A
i don't know i think we have to have something i really do	2716	A
yeah	2716	A
yeah i know i i don't know i i've having worked in doctor's offices and stuff i see it from a physician's point of view and i	2716	A
i think the problem with the skyrocketing costs right now is the insurance companies because_1 i don't see doctors getting all rich	2716	A
and i think hospitals do make money but not nearly as much as insurance companies do i think they are really making a killing and nobody's talking about it nobody's	2716	A
uh-hum	2716	A
right	2716	A
right right there are mistakes are made right sure sure yep	2716	A
so is i guess- yeah i think that's the legal part it coming in to too that i wonder if we should have a limit on how much people can sue for	2716	A
or or i don't know because then that's where the insurance company benefits- if if people weren't having to spend these huge amounts of money on getting insurance coverage	2716	A
you know yeah	2716	A
are you okay at where oh okay uh-huh are what i'm in Texas yep yep yep	2716	A
uh-huh oh great yeah	2716	A
uh-huh	2716	A
oh yeah uh-huh	2716	A
uh-huh okay	2716	A
yeah uh-huh	2716	A
oh no	2716	A
that that that can't be legal	2716	A
oh my gosh	2716	A
how can they how- how can they make you pay for insurance coverage	2716	A
how how does it keep the cost down	2716	A
oh so they just use the money for something else besides your insurance policy	2716	A
okay okay okay so you're subsidizing the hospital	2716	A
uh-huh	2716	A
okay oh good	2716	A
you are	2716	A
you are i know and see that's the thing that is the thing now that i'm in my thirties now and i have three kids and i'm	2716	A
i mean i'm very liberal i'm extremely liberal and um	2716	A
and i say- but now i just in the last couple years i have gotten to the point where i am saying i just can not afford to pay any more	2716	A
to help people out i i wanna keep helping people out but i need the federal- for the government or the agencies to find a way to do it on	2716	A
the amount of money you know that i can afford i just can't afford any more it's it's out it's just outrageously	2716	A
it's just starting to get me angry and for the first time in my life i'm starting to feel like i	2716	A
well i guess it has a lot to do with a lot of the stuff that i find out that i'm paying for now you know	2716	A
i mean i can't afford to have some kind of some kind of voluntary- optional operation for myself	2716	A
because our our medical coverage has gotten increasingly worse over say the past five years to the point now where even if we need surgery our insurance only covers eighty percent of it	2716	A
and right and so no matter what happens to me if i get in to a car accident this afternoon i have no idea- you know no way of being able to afford the outrageous medical cost because my insurance is now only eighty percent of what ever it's going to be	2716	A
and um so on top of that um then what if i what if we decide to have universal health insurance so i am subsidizing	2716	A
and and what if they are lucky enough to get into a doctor and a program that's going to say okay well you really need to have those varicose veins or fixed or your teeth fixed or something like that and i'm paying for it	2716	A
you know it- stuff like that has happened with education and other things that you hear about and it's just wait a minute you know my kids aren't getting that how come their kids- kids are getting	2716	A
and and i know that it's only in a few cases and i don't want them to- to uh cut funding for welfare programs or anything i don't want them to do that because_1 i know a lot of people they live right on the edge and they need that	2716	A
but but i	2716	A
uh-hum	2716	A
uh-huh	2716	A
uh-hum right	2716	A
well yeah that's and it's uh it's funny because_1 a couple years ago i hear a quote from Winston Churchill let's see if i can remember it anybody who's not a liberal in his twenties has no heart and a person who's not a conservative in his fifties has no brain	2716	A
it was something like that yeah and uh	2716	A
i don't know i guess that's what's happening to me but i i i think it's just starting um its	2716	A
i i don't know maybe other people i do you think it's a sign of the times that people are starting to say alright really we really mean it no more taxes or maybe is it just my own personal	2716	A
yeah	2716	A
no no income tax	2716	A
yeah	2716	A
oh	2716	A
oh	2716	A
wow yep	2716	A
yeah but i tell you um we have incredible property taxes down here	2716	A
so yeah and we don't have the services that other states	2716	A
yeah i think it's probably a good idea um i think given that um	2716	B
well given that there're so many people who don't have health insurance it's probably a real	2716	B
smart thing that at least have some basic coverage for everyone i mean you hear these horror stories of people	2716	B
homeless people going to the hospital and and being thrown out because they have no insurance and having to go to someplace else you know it would be nice if	2716	B
no matter where you are or who you are or what happened you know what happened to you you go to the hospital and they say okay just just take him don't worry about you know who or what he is later so	2716	B
that would be a nice thing	2716	B
yeah no that that is certainly true but i wonder about like like in Canada in Canada where everybody everybody um automatically has insurance in Canada	2716	B
yeah	2716	B
that's true that's something i haven't thought about	2716	B
that's true that's true	2716	B
no oh so you don't get any choices at all or anything-	2716	B
oh that's a problem yeah because_1 i i mean i know i even	2716	B
even among you know even- even now the way we have it now there's	2716	B
there are some places-	2716	B
yeah i mean like	2716	B
we have an an HMO that allows us to pick our own physicians	2716	B
and we picked a primary care physician and just didn't like him you know and	2716	B
and had to switch because_1 i felt he was a quack so	2716	B
yeah	2716	B
yeah that is the extreme and what what that i what that i think tends to do though is i think that tends to	2716	B
that probably has two a a good and a bad side for young people wanting to become doctors i mean what you get is other people who are motivated to be because_1 the money isn't i guess as much for doctors anymore so they would wind up getting	2716	B
the people who really want to be doctors being doctors but then again you know you don't get those people who'd be good and are real smart and decided hey i i wanna make a lot of money so i will go into medicine you know you don't get those	2716	B
yeah that's true	2716	B
yeah and it would be nice to to see something where at least	2716	B
right i mean even something that said you know look free major medical to all you know to everyone and then beyond that you sort of work out on your own if if you want	2716	B
uh-huh	2716	B
oh yeah	2716	B
oh right no	2716	B
yeah they're the ones who make i mean they're the ones they have you know although i mean it's the unfortunate part of that is that is that people i think tend to forget that doctors are humans as well	2716	B
so that so that you know insurance companies have to charge a substantial amount for certain people or certain physician- types of of of doctors	2716	B
given that you know someone decides to have a malpractice suit against them well they could take you know it could be millions i mean unfortunately and and if the doctor whether it was you know i mean i'm sure there're those cases where the doctor was wrong or malicious or something you know but there are you know i mean	2716	B
mistakes you know everybody makes mistakes unfortunately and and it shouldn't be a billion dollar you know industry it should be i made a mistake and this is this is fair compensation not	2716	B
yeah that is a big problem	2716	B
that'd be nice	2716	B
uh-huh it would be a lot better yeah and i'm sort of in a in a government run medicine program sort of i'm i'm in a well well i'm a graduate student at and uh	2716	B
at University of Rochester in Rochester New York i'll bet you're in Texas up yeah i was gonna bet that okay um	2716	B
yeah and as as it turns out my wife has pretty decent coverage through her company and can get me covered as well	2716	B
but uh which is great except- and because the university- but the university offers two plans they offer what they call the mandatory portion which is basically major medical and then they offer the waiveable portion	2716	B
which is which is you know every- you know sort of everything else you need so your your your your basic care beyond major medical separate stuff	2716	B
and they don't and even though my my wife's insurance covers me for everything i still have to pay them a hundred some odd dollars a semester for the mandatory portion of the insurance	2716	B
yeah i'm not actually sure it is or not but no one people keep sort of fighting it and i'm and i keep meaning to fight it but you know it just one of these things where i don't want to spend my time	2716	B
well the reason the i mean their rational is is they make everyone pay for it so that it it keeps the cost of university health services down	2716	B
and everyone can use it you know it	2716	B
because everyone is now forced to pay for this	2716	B
and there's like a	2716	B
uh well no what yeah well what they used it no they what they use it for is is is university health services we have a we have a hospital here and a subportion- a subportion of the hospital was	2716	B
right so i'm basically paying for a welfare state now as it turns out as it turns out um my wife and i have chosen to use the university as health services as out primary care physician- we can do that	2716	B
so in in but in effect i am pay twice for one service so	2716	B
uh-hum	2716	B
yeah yeah	2716	B
yeah well that's that's certain true	2716	B
right which is ridiculous	2716	B
yeah	2716	B
everybody else	2716	B
right	2716	B
exactly i don't i don't uh	2716	B
uh-huh yeah it's it's one of the strange- i i think it's strange is that as you get older i i i think the tendency is that as people get older	2716	B
and gain i don't i don't i don't want to say more responsibilities but you know things like homes and kids and so forth they tend to lose that liberalism they had when they were younger	2716	B
that is probably very true	2716	B
no i i think- think people are starting to really mean it i mean everywhere you look you're getting something new i mean you start off you know especially um you guys i believe in Texas you don't have state tax do you	2716	B
right we have we have federal income tax state income tax local income tax we have state tax on gasoline um you know because_1 our our you know so on top of the federal tax on gasoline we have state tax on gasoline so we're just	2716	B
or that could be yeah making up for the difference	2716	B
okay	2726	B
oh	2726	B
and how big is it	2726	B
yeah	2726	B
right well what's- what's included in that	2726	B
like washer dryer or nothing	2726	B
wow yeah	2726	B
which one is it	2726	B
where	2726	B
oh okay okay yeah i- i used to live in Waco so	2726	B
yeah yes yes	2726	B
yeah um we live in a house here and uh it's	2726	B
a three bedroom two bath and uh i it's i don't know i got two numbers today actually we were talking about mortgage insurance today with my agent and uh it's about sixteen hundred square feet which is fine for the two of us	2726	B
but it it you know we looked at a lot of houses that were had more square footage but they didn't use it right you know it was a bunch of empty	2726	B
you know hallway and stuff that yeah yeah really so we've used every bit of it and our house um	2726	B
we bought it for sixty four and uh the neighbors house next door to us sold for seventy five	2726	B
so i- you know i think we were you know got a good deal on it considering yeah yeah yeah well	2726	B
oh really my husband's from New Jersey	2726	B
yeah that's what we were looking for the first thing	2726	B
wow um-hum yeah	2726	B
but that's what we had uh uh that's what we had looked for was our main concern was a big living room you know and big closet space you know i said	2726	B
yeah	2726	B
yeah	2726	B
and uh so that's that's what we went for first and and it you know we we don't we just have a big living room an and a dining room is separate	2726	B
and you know some places have like the house next door to us that we looked at had a living room a dining room and a den but to stick a wall between two rooms	2726	B
didn't do anything for us just so we could have a living room and a den so we opted for the just the whole wide room that went from one end of the house to the other just about	2726	B
yeah	2726	B
oh	2726	B
yeah	2726	B
yeah	2726	B
yeah	2726	B
right i but i- i think for where we are um i think we got a real good deal on it and we you know we have a uh	2726	B
the backyard is just huge it is just really i think another house could fit back there	2726	B
and uh we really liked it of course when you have to mow it you know in uh middle of August it's it's kind of a little hot yeah but uh it's it's nice and that was	2726	B
you know a big selling point too and i think another thing that was really nice was that our neighbors on the other side of us bought the lot right next to us	2726	B
and they've lived there and have it all built up you know they've got a whole garden and trees and everything so it's not like we're uh kind of secluded you know we don't have a neighbor's fence coming up to ours	2726	B
you know right up to our bathroom window or whatever it is like a lot of the little model homes that they you know throw up in three days	2726	B
and uh	2726	B
no no not at all in fact uh we we talked about that just a little bit you know we were joking around about uh	2726	B
winning a sweepstakes and what would we do with the money and Steve said we'll i'll buy a bigger house and i said no i would just fix this one you know there's you know because_1 we i like where it is and i like how it's laid out and it took us forever	2726	B
to find it but when we found it it was we knew it yeah	2726	B
yeah have you had any	2726	B
yeah	2726	B
where	2726	B
oh okay oh okay	2726	B
right	2726	B
right	2726	B
um yeah and that's and that's one thing is once you you know you get into a house it's like you- you get more stuff	2726	B
and to put it all back into an apartment would just never work God i can't believe we moved out of an apartment and had this much stuff and it actually fit you know of course we got it on a little bit of more furniture and stuff but	2726	B
yeah	2726	B
yeah	2726	B
yeah	2726	B
yeah and that's actually three fifteen over there's probably not real real bad for for Waco and and for as many gosh as many as apartments and condos are over there	2726	B
i mean it it's just and and especially around Lake Shore area that area's picked up quite a bit since we were there and uh	2726	B
yeah because_1 i- i had lived in the gosh i'm not sure what they're called now but they were Lake Shore Apartments that are like right next to this baseball field MCC Baseball field but	2726	B
no the ones next door to those there were Lake Shore there's a i don't know what they look like now	2726	B
yeah there was a nursing home and then there's an apartment and then there's another apartment and we lived in those those third ones and they we moved in when they were brand new uh you know we drive by now and think gosh you know look how much it's changed an	2726	B
oh ever now and then um it just we	2726	B
it's uh yeah and it's not really now that it's sixty five it doesn't take hardly anytime to get there you know run to the mall or run to Sam's or	2726	B
just for the fact that the	2726	B
you know it's	2726	B
it seemed like as soon as we bought this house	2726	B
we saw all these houses for sale you know and i think now a lot of them_1 are selling and a lot of sellers are getting close to what they want instead of you know just having to give it away	2726	B
yeah	2726	B
um-hum	2726	B
yeah	2726	B
yeah	2726	B
yeah i- i saw i see that a lot too there and it's nice too i liked living there	2726	B
uh-huh	2726	B
well i guess we chewed up the house market and apartment market for a while	2726	B
you too Tanya all right bye-bye	2726	B
okay yeah i'm originally from New York and i go visit a lot and their real estate up there is i mean ridiculous absolutely ridiculous	2726	A
an apartment here like i live in an apartment and my apartment is three fifteen a month and it's just the one it's a one bedroom	2726	A
which is still kind of expensive but i prefer to live in uh in a nice part of town because i feel safe here and i- i- i pay more to feel safe you know	2726	A
you mean in a one bedroom oh nothing hum-um i mean just	2726	A
nothing no microwave we've got i have ceiling fan i guess that's something it's a real cute it's got a little vaulted ceiling and mirrored um mirrored uh	2726	A
it's Wood um listen to me i can't even think of the name of my own apartment Woodhollow right next to Village Green it's on yeah kind of far North Waco	2726	A
oh okay yeah far north like um on Lake Shore where all those apartments are it's right up there so	2726	A
uh-huh	2726	A
uh-huh	2726	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2726	A
uh-huh	2726	A
right	2726	A
uh-huh	2726	A
right	2726	A
uh-huh	2726	A
that could have been used as yeah yeah	2726	A
um	2726	A
uh-huh	2726	A
yeah so that looks good when you all get ready to sell you'll probably do really well my father used to live in Dallas uh now he he went back to New Jersey we're originally from the East but he	2726	A
oh really he uh well actually right now he lives in Rhode Island he	2726	A
lived in New Jersey for a while now he's in Rhode Island and um he used to like to go and we used to go just every weekend just to look at houses for no reason we weren't buying one every weekend but just to look at them	2726	A
and so i got a pretty good feel of you know what i want when i do you know get my house whenever that is um	2726	A
what was i going to say about that i completely lost my train of thought um but we we enjoy going looking at houses and and um we now i kind of have a good idea of what i want i know i want a big family area um	2726	A
yeah fire a fireplace i saw this awesome house the other weekend it was a great big family room and it was circular and the other side was the patio and the backyard	2726	A
um-hum	2726	A
right yeah i like a lot of closet space i don't like because_1 i don't like to have a lot of things out you know just all over the place i like to have them_1 kind of tucked away	2726	A
um-hum	2726	A
um-hum	2726	A
right	2726	A
um-hum	2726	A
um-hum	2726	A
my father had uh i keep talking about my father because_1 he owned a house um	2726	A
he had the kitchen kind of a kitchen and a very long family room it's just kind of one room and what he did he put uh a bar right in the center and put some um a glass rack	2726	A
down so you had like wine glasses hanging from the ceiling and then the bar and it just kind of it kind of separated it it was still you know together but it just looked a lot better	2726	A
because_1 i personally don't like the combination	2726	A
rooms so	2726	A
um-hum	2726	A
um-hum	2726	A
yeah i'd like a big backyard	2726	A
oh really	2726	A
yeah a little hot try to do it early in the mornings	2726	A
um	2726	A
uh-huh	2726	A
hum	2726	A
wow	2726	A
uh-huh well that's good yeah yeah	2726	A
uh-huh that's true they do throw those up	2726	A
are you all planning to move anytime are you looking for a house or not um-hum um-hum	2726	A
um-hum	2726	A
um-hum	2726	A
yeah really	2726	A
um-hum	2726	A
to find it um-hum	2726	A
you knew that was it i'll probably i'll probably move but i'll probably move to another apartment or something because_1 i'm i'm i'm really	2726	A
um what's the word i move a lot anyway because_1 the job i have i only work like here i'll be here for like a year and then i'll move off i can move up	2726	A
and so i'm a i'm i'm a news reporter i work at Channel Six and so this is like my first job so i won't be here very long so i'm not even looking to buy anything as permanent as a house	2726	A
you know so i'm staying- staying in an apartment and i'm not married or anything so it's no biggie	2726	A
um-hum	2726	A
yeah yeah	2726	A
um-hum	2726	A
yeah	2726	A
yeah	2726	A
like i'm amazed at how much stuff i've accumulated in my apartment because up to this point i was in school and so i'd go home every summer	2726	A
and i could take all my stuff home because_1 i didn't have a bed or a couch or any any of that but now i could not move back home and i just realized this you know the other day i'm going wait a minute i can't go back home for the summer or anything i have too much stuff so	2726	A
it was just like a weird transition out of home so i have to move in apartments just because_1 i have so much stuff	2726	A
no it's not it's not yeah	2726	A
oh my goodness yeah um-hum	2726	A
um-hum	2726	A
yeah um-hum there there are tons of apartments down here i mean and it	2726	A
MCC yeah yeah i- i think i think they're called Lake Shore Villa or something	2726	A
hum and it's a nursing there was a nursing home or something like that	2726	A
um-hum um-hum	2726	A
um i think that- uh-huh	2726	A
yeah	2726	A
how often do you all come through Waco	2726	A
um-hum	2726	A
depends on what's going on	2726	A
um-hum um-hum yeah	2726	A
um-hum all right	2726	A
hum	2726	A
you think uh-huh uh-huh	2726	A
um	2726	A
um	2726	A
Waco to me seems seems like it's pretty steady i mean i'm not a real estate person or anything but it it	2726	A
it's a real college town and so you know you have these apartments and then the the houses are all most of the houses are pretty nice and i don't i don't you know really see a lot on sale or anything and people are pretty stable here	2726	A
you know i kind of see this as kind of a retirement community as i always call it yeah um um-hum	2726	A
nice and quiet	2726	A
so i don't think i could live here much longer but i'll deal with it	2726	A
well it	2726	A
yeah really okay well it was very nice talking to you okay you take care okay bye-bye	2726	A
so child care your views	2755	A
and what religious faith	2755	A
oh	2755	A
that's that's good	2755	A
uh they do seem to be at the outside edge of both extremes don't they	2755	A
and whenever	2755	A
they are they seem to	2755	A
regulate the good toward the bad instead of bad toward the good	2755	A
better situations	2755	A
yeah yeah that's that that's very well phrased uh	2755	A
so have you ever used outside child care	2755	A
real day care	2755	A
uh	2755	A
our step daughter's ten now	2755	A
and	2755	A
most of the day care has been provide for by Grandma	2755	A
but	2755	A
quite honestly what i believe to be	2755	A
the best day care situation was while we lived up the pass of Woodland Park	2755	A
there was uh	2755	A
ex school teacher that uh	2755	A
did	2755	A
a small amount of before school and	2755	A
and after school you know kindergartners or half-dayers	2755	A
in her home	2755	A
and they would read and play	2755	A
seem to be	2755	A
uh yeah and uh	2755	A
despite	2755	A
our beliefs	2755	A
she was uh	2755	A
one of the more um	2755	A
charismatic Christian faiths	2755	A
and it worked out wonderfully	2755	A
uh yeah but i don't know that it would be state approved	2755	A
i	2755	A
now i don't know what the current Texas laws are	2755	A
but i	2755	A
but i do know that the license doesn't seem to	2755	A
guarantee quality	2755	A
uh	2755	A
now here i believe that	2755	A
child care	2755	A
meets by and large certain standards for	2755	A
uh	2755	A
balanced food if they provide food	2755	A
cleanliness	2755	A
and	2755	A
levels of supervision	2755	A
levels being defined as	2755	A
number of of working adults for	2755	A
number of	2755	A
children	2755	A
but	2755	A
yeah uh	2755	A
my wife is uh agnostic	2755	A
and i'm a	2755	A
backsliding Presbyterian	2755	A
and uh	2755	A
yet	2755	A
i really believe that this	2755	A
charismatic	2755	A
care	2755	A
or the charismatic belief when emphasized on care	2755	A
or semi charismatic i might say	2755	A
was quite good	2755	A
yes very	2755	A
and and	2755	A
uh	2755	A
the care is what i guess you should emphasize in the term child care instead of the child	2755	A
and not have any care	2755	A
and i'm not sure that really	2755	A
child care per se should instill	2755	A
any	2755	A
education per se	2755	A
you know what i'm saying	2755	A
proper interface	2755	A
it's just just correctness of of	2755	A
social skills if you will	2755	A
uh yeah uh	2755	A
it's a very broad issue	2755	A
and	2755	A
you know it's a shame but most people doing child care	2755	A
earn almost no money	2755	A
they operate at you know um	2755	A
the owner of the child- of a you know we're talking large child care facility now we're not talking somebody that does six kids in their home or or three or or whatever	2755	A
right	2755	A
their employees earn almost nothing	2755	A
and and that's really a a shame too because	2755	A
do you and your husband both work	2755	A
well that's wonderful if if you can make it that way	2755	A
well like i said	2755	A
that's	2755	A
grand if if you can pull it off	2755	A
but	2755	A
more and more	2755	A
we're being forced into a situation we as Americans are being forced into a situation	2755	A
where	2755	A
you've got to have	2755	A
uh well we only have one child right now and another one on the way and right now i'm i'm home with her during the day	2755	B
i if i was looking for outside care i probably would stay away from professional child care centers	2755	B
and try to find if i was close to home relatives or people with the same values and possibly religious faith or something similar so that she would be raised in an environment that would be	2755	B
similar to what we would have in our own homes as as parents	2755	B
uh Latter Day Saints	2755	B
so	2755	B
that's what i would try to do	2755	B
with a teaching background i've um had a little bit of experience with some of the child day care type situations but i've seen some good ones and i've seen some really bad ones	2755	B
uh-huh and everything in between yeah because there's in most states there's nothing to regulate them	2755	B
and so	2755	B
right by trying to get them to conform to concern standards they uh kind of uh eliminate a lot of the	2755	B
uh	2755	B
yeah the the uh what am i trying to think of that-	2755	B
not the imagination but the creativity in in the situation and so	2755	B
no i haven't we've had like people come in and babysit for an hour or two but i've never had um	2755	B
right she's she's not even a year yet so	2755	B
we haven't been in you know a lot of need yet	2755	B
uh-huh	2755	B
yeah i like that situation that's usually real good	2755	B
uh-huh	2755	B
uh-huh	2755	B
have a relative structured- a structured	2755	B
activities and not just you know stick them in a corner and say you're on your own	2755	B
uh-huh	2755	B
yeah i know that um that	2755	B
i guess if you have the opportunity to pick and choose and you've got the time and that uh	2755	B
i don't know if the resources are the proper term you know just the the know knowledge of who's a available then you could probably find some really good care	2755	B
that's true you can get somebody somebody willing to babysit but actual	2755	B
you know that's sometimes different on a done on a different scale	2755	B
i have even considered you know babysitting myself i have a teaching degree and uh	2755	B
thought well you know i could structure and then for one reason or other decided not to	2755	B
but i think if you take more than three children in well that was how it was this Virginia we've recently moved here to Texas	2755	B
but in Virginia i think if you take more than three children in on more than a several hours a day bases you have to be licensed	2755	B
yeah a lot of times you might just need to go now and feel file for it just like a business you may not have to prove any type of qualification for it i don't	2755	B
uh-huh	2755	B
uh-huh	2755	B
that's uh kind of a minimum there that you're getting your covering basic care there and not	2755	B
all the extras that most people would like to see	2755	B
done with there children you know like the educational activities the supervised play and	2755	B
so forth	2755	B
i like that term	2755	B
uh-huh	2755	B
uh-huh	2755	B
yeah it was a good influence for your daughter uh	2755	B
well that's good	2755	B
uh-huh	2755	B
yeah a little bit of love and and attention is what most of them need	2755	B
you know even if it's	2755	B
not a real educated program you can have good educational program and and	2755	B
right and and that's not certainly what you want for your child or what you would give your child yourself	2755	B
and so	2755	B
well even educated play uh supervised play can teach without and i'm not saying talking about sitting down and teaching them math or or or something like that but just kind of promoting social skills and uh	2755	B
you know like my my child that she want be an only child for long but you know she was an only child or maybe your daughter not having yeah	2755	B
yeah just	2755	B
uh-huh right those basic things that uh they would	2755	B
that you know maybe a little bit of uh	2755	B
i don't know if manners is a is a good term or not but you know dealing with other through uh	2755	B
proper mannerisms and politeness and so forth you know that sort of thing you'd want your child to learn that	2755	B
from been experience with i mean someone else certainly you wouldn't want your child's day care person to yell at them and scream at them and say do this do that you know you'd want them to	2755	B
promote politeness and niceness you know the things that you would want any child to learn	2755	B
and -usually that's done through example not you know an actual sit down learn situation so	2755	B
uh-huh it is	2755	B
uh-huh	2755	B
uh-huh	2755	B
who really doesn't really put a lot of overhead whatever into it you mean somebody that has an actual establishment	2755	B
yeah	2755	B
yeah	2755	B
i know i i did that for summer so i can i can vouch for that	2755	B
no just he does i'm i'm here during the day with her	2755	B
well we we decided to live with a uh uh lesser budget so that we have that that's more important to us	2755	B
you know as as uh	2755	B
there may come a time when i will be working again you know but right now that's what we've chosen and we wanted to have several we got her and we've got another on the way and	2755	B
may have another one soon after that so	2755	B
right	2755	B
what's the uh in Texas law has a uh	2734	A
what does it have it has a death penalty doesn't it	2734	A
but now it's coming back into favor	2734	A
well my sociology class at SMU's taught us that it was not a deterrent	2734	A
uh but now that's just what they said uh i don't know maybe maybe if i went back and took a sociology class now they'd say it is a deterrent	2734	A
maybe they've changed their minds	2734	A
maybe that's it maybe that's it because that was back in the seventies	2734	A
i think i agree but i think it ought to be expanded to include children	2734	A
i i think they're they have they're working on something- uh something in Austin now	2734	A
and i'm not sure what it is i just remember seeing a uh kind of a synopsis of it	2734	A
well uh i'm i'm personally very in favor of it	2734	A
uh why should we let them set in prison and work on their college degrees	2734	A
after they've mowed down a class yard full of kids or tried- or tried to or done their very you know given their best effort at doing that	2734	A
i i don't care to support them	2734	A
sure	2734	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2734	A
and then there was the black woman that uh robbed and shot the furrier	2734	A
and she was set free too just in two examples in Texas recently	2734	A
but she actually killed the furrier or someone she was charged with murder	2734	A
and then then they decided it was a case of mistaken identity or something i didn't i don't i didn't retain all those facts very well but i know what you're what if we make a mistake	2734	A
and that's not one of those things that you can turn the wheel back and reverse everything	2734	A
well	2734	A
well i guess though where i would have a problem with it if i were on the jury	2734	A
that that put that handed down the death sentence because it was my judgement the person's guilty	2734	A
now that's tougher	2734	A
it's easier to say it on the telephone and everyone agree that yeah the death penalty's the way to go it's a deterrent to crime they shouldn't catch themselves in that circumstance anyway but to be the actual one of the ones that decide that would be tougher for me	2734	A
i think i'd probably do it but we could never say what we would do if we're not in the circumstance it that's that's that's a real easy thing to say that oh sure i would but i don't know	2734	A
well yes but	2734	A
you know that's what they did	2734	A
or rather than have a warped mind it was just the only way to get whatever they wanted	2734	A
and they they wanted something worse than they more than they respect the human life	2734	A
hang them_1 yeah	2734	A
yeah i agree it should be in effect also i agree there should be a lot of care in the enforcement uh so i guess i would say i want it to be in effect but i want	2734	A
maybe	2734	A
well i'd i now i have a problem with this too i think our courts have too many opportunities for them to go back and get one more chance	2734	A
that's correct it is it is	2734	A
now there's some and maybe uh now i don't remember if this is Texas or not that has something about all drug dealers	2734	A
can be sentenced to the death sentence	2734	A
convicted drug dealers	2734	A
is it what is what's the rule-	2734	A
it's something of the distribution- they're on the distribution end	2734	A
they're not selling them_1 they're distributing them_1 it's for the large dealers is what it's reserved for	2734	A
and they they are in effect killing people	2734	A
oh okay	2734	A
is that how it's worded	2734	A
i knew it was there but i i or proposed- or is it proposed or is it passed	2734	A
i believe it is i believe you're right though i think it is	2734	A
and i have to agree with that	2734	A
i i think it certainly should be one of the options	2734	A
uh i've been fortunate with my children and grandchildren so far that i know i qualify that heavily	2734	A
because you never know	2734	A
but to the best of my knowledge we haven't had a major problem yet	2734	A
but it just touches so many young people	2734	A
um	2734	A
well my children are about in the same age bracket i think let's see the oldest	2734	A
is thirty two and the youngest is probably twenty seven twenty eight	2734	A
so it's the same age bracket	2734	A
and there's four two girls and two boys and i think one of each experimented very slightly with pot and i think that was the extent of it to the best of my knowledge	2734	A
boy that's tough	2734	A
my husband hasn't quit yet	2734	A
and	2734	A
he knows he has to and he knows he should and he knows and he knows but he hasn't	2734	A
i do respect the fact though that he refuses to smoke in the same room with me he he's	2734	A
very conscious of of passive smoking and he's concerned about it but	2734	A
hasn't quite made it yet	2734	A
yeah i've seen all of this yeah	2734	A
well Charles will actually Charles will not smoke in anyone else's house except our own	2734	A
he will get up and he'll go outside	2734	A
you know and he he's so when we're invited to people's house he will not smoke in their house	2734	A
which i think is good because there's a lot of people that are very particularly if they have children	2734	A
but uh and he's you know he tries his best but the actual quitting he hasn't done he changed brands to a brand he doesn't like	2734	A
he put up all of his ash trays he will not smoke in a comfortable position you know	2734	A
but still he's done everything the Smokers Anonymous tell you to do except quit smoking	2734	A
it's a long process	2734	A
oh how neat	2734	A
he has his in the kitchen	2734	A
oh yes yeah they just uh started it again too just late or within the past few years	2734	B
you know for quite some time just about every one of the states had given up the death penalty	2734	B
uh yes well they find it is more deterrent	2734	B
well uh if you	2734	B
you know compare the figures i could think that's where they're uh they're coming from	2734	B
the uh	2734	B
oh there yes they are that was before the uh uh they adopted the death law again	2734	B
but uh i i like it myself am in favor of it uh particularly for uh	2734	B
well i think Texas has a good good law uh crimes murders related with uh drugs or killing a policemen	2734	B
uh-huh	2734	B
uh-huh well why stop at children why not go to adults too	2734	B
uh-huh	2734	B
uh-huh yep	2734	B
well i don't either but uh uh but there is something to be said about	2734	B
or uh uh just- just for the sake of argument i'm taking the uh a con i'm against- i'm against	2734	B
uh you know yourself how many times have you heard where uh uh a citizen was wrongfully arrested	2734	B
and served time at a penitentiary uh just recently this uh black man served nine years was it	2734	B
for robbery	2734	B
uh-huh	2734	B
that's it	2734	B
uh-huh well right now our laws are so liberal that uh	2734	B
even with the death penalty in effect i don't think that uh	2734	B
they're going to use it uh too frequently	2734	B
uh unfortunately i like you say yes let's have it put them all give them all a shot get rid of them	2734	B
why should they be sitting- sitting in uh prison getting their college degree	2734	B
uh-huh	2734	B
yes very true i uh i agree with you there uh	2734	B
uh-huh well i myself wouldn't want to be on the jury like that	2734	B
uh i it it's uh that's an awful lot to uh to expect of a person to uh to kill somebody is what it amounts to	2734	B
it true very true but they they did it because they have a warped mind for some reason	2734	B
yeah well uh	2734	B
uh-huh	2734	B
yeah exactly	2734	B
well anyhow i guess we both agree that that it is it should be in effect	2734	B
oh that's true well now any uh just believe in just about any state in the union uh uh uh a death uh or uh yeah death verdict is an automatic uh appeal	2734	B
and uh	2734	B
uh yes i'm inclined to agree with you i think so there should be a limit as to the number of appeals	2734	B
um um well no-	2734	B
not just for dealing in drugs it uh	2734	B
there are certain circumstances and i don't remember what they are	2734	B
uh yes	2734	B
uh-huh	2734	B
oh oh yes yes i i believe it's any capital crime related to drugs	2734	B
i think that's the way it's worded	2734	B
i do believe that's in	2734	B
uh i wouldn't swear to it myself but i thought it i thought it was in effect	2734	B
uh-huh	2734	B
uh-huh	2734	B
oh it does uh i have four sons myself	2734	B
and the youngest is twenty eight so they are all pretty well grown up and they all went through it you know going through high school and everything	2734	B
and knock wood that uh	2734	B
they have not	2734	B
well i won't say they didn't try it	2734	B
uh i wouldn't know but uh they i doubt very much that they're they're using it now in fact i'm sure they don't	2734	B
huh	2734	B
yes	2734	B
uh-huh	2734	B
yeah that's usually the way it is it it's just uh	2734	B
try it out with their peers	2734	B
and none of them even smoke they don't uh they never been strangely enough uh their mother and i both smoked when they were growing up	2734	B
now my my my wife my ex-wife she quit uh	2734	B
well when she was pregnant with the last one and she never started up again	2734	B
and i just quit oh about fourteen months and two weeks ago	2734	B
yes it is i and it seems to be getting tougher as time goes by	2734	B
um	2734	B
well	2734	B
well when i was still smoking i i felt that way if i was in a public restaurant seated at table with uh non smokers i would	2734	B
try to pick a seat- a a my	2734	B
seat where the smoke would blow away from them	2734	B
or i'd hold the cigarette under the table	2734	B
and uh but uh now i'm on the shoe's on the other foot	2734	B
uh i'm aware of other people smoking now	2734	B
um	2734	B
yes	2734	B
uh-huh	2734	B
uh uh-huh	2734	B
well the	2734	B
there's a trick i use they used to leave my cigarettes in the glove compartment	2734	B
and every time i wanted one i have to go outside and just take one	2734	B
one at a time	2734	B
and uh that that's gets to be uh a deterrent	2734	B
uh you know i when i was much younger uh than i am now i- i had wanted to go to the Peace Corps	2793	B
and uh	2793	B
seems like i it it was something that i- i really wanted wanted to do	2793	B
seems like wanting to go to the Peace Corps was something that i had really wanted to do when i was young	2793	B
but uh i don't believe they accept you after you you know after you're married and you have uh kids and all that so i got into that and i wasn't able to	2793	B
to uh participate	2793	B
oh they will	2793	B
oh i didn't know that	2793	B
then there's no age limit	2793	B
your kidding	2793	B
goodness i'm surprised i really had no idea	2793	B
well	2793	B
i don't i don't really think that they should- they should be it should be mandatory i mean	2793	B
well	2793	B
i don't know i it's that just might not be something that everybody wants to do i mean there are a lot of people who would like to do it and there are a lot of people who get into other things and they get all involved and they just	2793	B
you know	2793	B
don't want to or don't have the time	2793	B
i don't see how that can can	2793	B
make a better class of Americans to make everybody	2793	B
to make it mandatory for everybody to participate	2793	B
that's true	2793	B
well	2793	B
i don't i don't think that	2793	B
yeah are are you suggesting then that if if uh if i have to go and and do something for the country for two years	2793	B
that the country will compensate me in some way	2793	B
i- i will be compensated for this i'm not just going to	2793	B
okay	2793	B
um-hum	2793	B
um-hum	2793	B
um-hum	2793	B
that that that's true but in even in our region there's an employment problem there's a lot of uh	2793	B
people gotten laid off lately you know from companies like General Dynamics of and Texas Instruments	2793	B
thousands and thousands of people are out there looking for jobs	2793	B
no no	2793	B
i'm not familiar with that	2793	B
oh i	2793	B
um-hum	2793	B
i see	2793	B
and that was	2793	B
that was some some some program where people gave their time	2793	B
in trade for	2793	B
some money- okay	2793	B
uh-huh	2793	B
um-hum	2793	B
um-hum	2793	B
well then i guess there are a lot of a lot of things that people could do to contribute to the good of the country	2793	B
um-hum	2793	B
i really- i really don't see anything wrong with it i just don't think that it should be mandatory that every person have to do that	2793	B
well	2793	B
uh-huh	2793	B
uh-huh	2793	B
um-hum	2793	B
all right i wonder if if they didn't make it mandatory if they would actually get enough people volunteering to- to- to do it that it you know that they would have enough	2793	B
i mean i	2793	B
i probably	2793	B
um-hum	2793	B
uh-huh	2793	B
oh well yes we have with with uh	2793	B
recent generations i- i know exactly what you are talking about i- i mean i know several people who do not wish- wish to work	2793	B
well they wish for the money and they they decide that they're going to get the money anyway they can with you know without	2793	B
uh without without working in the the traditional American	2793	B
job market	2793	B
right	2793	B
so what i'm saying they they get the money anyway they can	2793	B
yeah	2793	B
can you speak up please	2793	A
yes	2793	A
uh	2793	A
but	2793	A
they will accept you later in life also	2793	A
yeah after your children are grown	2793	A
yes	2793	A
no	2793	A
no i'm not some of the people that have	2793	A
been involved with Peace Corps among other things were retired teachers	2793	A
uh there was a retired plumber that went to uh	2793	A
uh Uruguay i think and helped them quite a bit with	2793	A
concepts in plumbing you know providing for a	2793	A
for better public hygiene	2793	A
yeah but	2793	A
so do you think that	2793	A
people should be required to	2793	A
give a couple years for the good of the country	2793	A
why	2793	A
well i understand but if it were told to us that we would find the time somewhere between our	2793	A
seventeenth and uh	2793	A
twenty sixth birthday to give a year or two to the to the country in the form of maybe building better roads or the parks service or	2793	A
the Peace Corps or	2793	A
something- you know the military service or something	2793	A
wouldn't we have uh	2793	A
maybe a better class of Americans	2793	A
a lot of these people- a lot of our uh	2793	A
pardon the terminology but yuppies now	2793	A
are interested in one thing and one thing only and that's themselves	2793	A
and at least if you legislated	2793	A
giving	2793	A
for a couple years of their lives	2793	A
or or uh	2793	A
a	2793	A
actually purely giving but but some sort of equitable exchange then at least	2793	A
the country would have gotten two years from them	2793	A
where	2793	A
hum	2793	A
they would have given something to the country instead of take taking	2793	A
away all their lives	2793	A
uh	2793	A
give them your time- give them your entire life for two years no	2793	A
it will be a job of sorts i'm sure that	2793	A
the Peace Corps pays it doesn't pay well it's not top wages	2793	A
but	2793	A
but it does pay	2793	A
the military	2793	A
for young hiring in soldiers	2793	A
does pay it doesn't pay well	2793	A
okay currently in our country	2793	A
especially in some regions	2793	A
there's an employment problem	2793	A
you're aware of that i'm sure	2793	A
and Texas Instruments	2793	A
you know in in another time we had the WPA	2793	A
Works Progress Administration	2793	A
during the great depression	2793	A
though i can't see why it was great	2793	A
uh	2793	A
that	2793	A
gave people	2793	A
pay that was	2793	A
halfway between relief	2793	A
which was welfare	2793	A
and	2793	A
the minimum wage	2793	A
in trade for	2793	A
money	2793	A
and	2793	A
and living	2793	A
they gave them_1 food and uniforms and	2793	A
uh here in Colorado you'll find	2793	A
a great many things	2793	A
public roads that were worked on by the WPA uh	2793	A
dams that were built by the WPA	2793	A
uh scenic overlooks	2793	A
parks	2793	A
we are road our road system's falling apart	2793	A
our our national road system system of highways	2793	A
and roads is falling apart	2793	A
there- there's a lot of work to be done	2793	A
i	2793	A
i can't see the problem in it for a year	2793	A
the	2793	A
what what i'm saying is that	2793	A
if it were mandatory	2793	A
that every person	2793	A
right after graduation from high school	2793	A
that were able bodied	2793	A
would give a year	2793	A
well or not give a year but	2793	A
but trade a year	2793	A
then they at least one not more than say three or four	2793	A
then	2793	A
it would definitely effect unemployment	2793	A
i don't know	2793	A
well you know Texas	2793	A
New Mexico Colorado	2793	A
huge numbers of other western states have no real welfare system	2793	A
there's Aid to Dependent Children	2793	A
and Aid to Mothers of Dependent Children but there's no real welfare system	2793	A
but if we took these people off	2793	A
off the streets for a year	2793	A
there would darn sure be more hours labor available in the nation for everyone else	2793	A
and who knows maybe	2793	A
some of our graduating high school seniors might-	2793	A
would find out	2793	A
a little bit more the	2793	A
what the traditional American work ethic means	2793	A
you know we have had some problem with that in recent years	2793	A
uh they wish only for the paycheck	2793	A
really producing	2793	A
yeah be it selling drugs or whatever	2793	A
yeah yeah	2793	A
and	2793	A
maybe if we	2793	A
instilled	2793	A
the work ethic	2793	A
you know i enjoy the i enjoy working	2793	A
so the topic is vacations	2711	A
i think so	2711	A
i enjoy them	2711	A
uh	2711	A
the last was back down to Lubbock to visit parents	2711	A
it was	2711	A
the last one was back down to Lubbock Texas visit family	2711	A
but that's not the tradition for us	2711	A
uh we enjoyed Yellowstone real well last year	2711	A
yeah	2711	A
oh Rocky Mountain National Park	2711	A
it's it's just like any of the other national parks it	2711	A
you know there's camping and fishing and hiking and wildlife watching and	2711	A
oh it's	2711	A
yeah	2711	A
we usually try and drive up there oh once every year or two	2711	A
sure	2711	A
to the top the of the peak sure	2711	A
oh it's not bad at all	2711	A
it's it's a beautiful drive	2711	A
now i admit up there the altitude is kind of	2711	A
interesting	2711	A
you know you get a little lightheaded and giddy but it's fun	2711	A
you know take along a picnic lunch and	2711	A
oh we love it	2711	A
i-	2711	A
uh	2711	A
no they're only to the east uh i mean to the west of us	2711	A
here in the Springs you know it's right there at the very foot of the Rockies	2711	A
you know and once a week we drive up into the mountains usually you know usually once a week once every other week	2711	A
yeah well i enjoy the hills	2711	A
in Texas too i've i've been in Sherman	2711	A
no i haven't you	2711	A
uh once to Mexico City but just a little day thing on business	2711	A
uh that's nice	2711	A
did you enjoy it	2711	A
did you enjoy it	2711	A
uh-huh	2711	A
uh	2711	A
uh got to eat some different kinds of foods and meet people from a different culture and	2711	A
oh	2711	A
huh	2711	A
so the place that i went that we've gone on vacation that i think i enjoyed the most	2711	A
was Seattle	2711	A
well	2711	A
we uh	2711	A
was two years ago	2711	A
we went during the drought	2711	A
i'm sorry three years ago it had been dry for a whole week	2711	A
it didn't rain for a whole week	2711	A
yeah somehow we picked the right time and uh	2711	A
walked down on the wharf and i think we ate seafood every meal for	2711	A
well not quite every meal but most meals for a week	2711	A
uh it was wonderful uh the Pacific Science Museum the little girl really enjoyed it's	2711	A
very interesting	2711	A
yeah	2711	A
yes it was it was super and uh	2711	A
went to the Seattle Aquarium	2711	A
and it's right down there	2711	A
on the	2711	A
right there on the ocean and	2711	A
down there on the wharf by the piers and all and	2711	A
you walk down in a dome a glass dome	2711	A
and the bay is circulating over your head and you can	2711	A
you can watch the fish swim by and sharks and	2711	A
oh it's	2711	A
yeah and then there's walrus and sea lion and porpoises and oh it's it's amazing	2711	A
oh absolutely	2711	A
without a doubt	2711	A
Seattle is beautiful and the mountains the mountains to the east of Seattle	2711	A
are just incredible	2711	A
i rode a ferry for the first time in my life	2711	A
you know up there	2711	A
you go from the mainland to a whole bunch of islands around there by ferry	2711	A
instead of by bridge	2711	A
and you drive your car on you park your car you set your brake you walk upstairs and you have a beer	2711	A
or coffee or whatever depending on the time of day	2711	A
it's amazing	2711	A
yes	2711	A
yes	2711	A
yeah yeah and	2711	A
there are people literally that	2711	A
everyday take the ferry you know and drive on to it yeah	2711	A
live on an island off off shore from Seattle	2711	A
and	2711	A
you uh everyday they drive on the ferry they go upstairs and have their morning coffee	2711	A
take for the twenty to	2711	A
hour and ten minutes that it takes to get across and	2711	A
you know depending on where it is	2711	A
well i- some places you know in some areas it it you know it depends how far they are commuting	2711	A
oh it it it's strict i'm i'm a West Texan	2711	A
out there in the land of no water	2711	A
and	2711	A
and to think that people live on the water daily is kind of odd to me	2711	A
you know it's it's a different life style	2711	A
than we are used to	2711	A
oh Galveston	2711	A
yes i liked Galveston real well uh	2711	A
there's uh one of the	2711	A
areas down there close to Galveston is	2711	A
i forget the name of the island but it's a bird sanctuary	2711	A
with all kinds of wild birds	2711	A
whooping and sand hill cranes and ducks and	2711	A
pelicans and it's very pretty uh i like the Rio Grande Valley	2711	A
real well of course you haven't lived until you have been to San Antone to the uh to the Alamo and take	2711	A
yeah the river walk oh it's	2711	A
and you need to go in the Spring when all the flowers are in bloom all up and down through there oh it's just simply beautiful	2711	A
and of course always when i lived in West Texas had to annually go down to San Antone just	2711	A
yeah and go to uh	2711	A
Lone Star and uh you know	2711	A
make my annual pilgrimage to the Lone Star Brewery and	2711	A
uh	2711	A
El Paso is kind of neat in kind of a funny way you know go across the border and all uh the Davis Mountains are interesting	2711	A
out there in West Texas	2711	A
yeah yeah uh now the right time of year to go there is in the middle of winter	2711	A
because	2711	A
there's a beauty to the desert that it can most be it can best be appreciated when you are not burning up	2711	A
you know whenever you- you've been kind of cold where you are at it's most enjoyable	2711	A
to get you know to get warm	2711	A
that's nice uh	2711	A
down there in the lower Rio Grande Valley	2711	A
closer to where the Rio Grande empties into the Gulf that's interesting i love the Texas Hill Country	2711	A
and uh	2711	A
Austin's neat for for an occasional visit	2711	A
yeah yeah it it's fun few days	2711	A
uh	2711	A
oh UT is real pretty	2711	A
uh there's a lot of little limestone lakes and caverns around that area Marble Falls and all that's real pretty uh	2711	A
i would say definitely go see that part and uh	2711	A
i'd say go to uh	2711	A
Midland once just for the heck of it	2711	A
i don't know why exactly	2711	A
but uh	2711	A
you know find out when they are holding	2711	A
the	2711	A
petroleum fair uh	2711	A
all right that's a good that's a good topic huh	2711	B
where did you go on your last vacation	2711	B
to what	2711	B
uh-huh yeah	2711	B
uh	2711	B
oh yeah	2711	B
what's your out of the out of the state type where do you like to go	2711	B
really	2711	B
what kind of uh vacation spots are there in Colorado	2711	B
uh-huh	2711	B
i think my parents took me there when i was real young we went to Colorado Springs and uh Rocky Mountain National Park it was real pretty	2711	B
got to see Pike's Peak	2711	B
you drive by yourself up there	2711	B
oh wow	2711	B
oh that's tough i don't i don't think i could do that	2711	B
oh	2711	B
yeah yeah	2711	B
sure is pretty up there	2711	B
you have mountains all around you	2711	B
where you live	2711	B
uh-huh	2711	B
wow that's neat i'm jealous there's hills in Texas	2711	B
but	2711	B
have you ever been out of the United States for uh vacation	2711	B
or business	2711	B
uh	2711	B
uh-huh	2711	B
i went to uh	2711	B
the Bahamas last year on a cruise for my honeymoon	2711	B
which is really neat i had never been out of	2711	B
really out of Texas or Indiana much out of the United States	2711	B
i'm from Indiana so	2711	B
what	2711	B
yeah it was great	2711	B
it was really pretty down there	2711	B
uh-huh yeah really did there in fact one uh family that	2711	B
sat at our table every meal was from London and they had never been to the United States so they were really enjoying it and they were telling us about all their trips and	2711	B
they had been to Disneyland and	2711	B
it was neat to meet different people	2711	B
uh-huh	2711	B
oh really i've heard it's really pretty up there	2711	B
uh-huh	2711	B
oh	2711	B
oh wow	2711	B
yeah that would have been nice that would have been best time to go	2711	B
uh-huh	2711	B
Pacific Sites	2711	B
really	2711	B
uh-huh	2711	B
uh-huh	2711	B
oh wow	2711	B
that would be neat	2711	B
that's the vacation you recommend huh	2711	B
yeah	2711	B
yeah i've heard it is	2711	B
uh-huh	2711	B
really	2711	B
oh wow	2711	B
uh-huh	2711	B
oh	2711	B
uh-huh	2711	B
and your car is on a ferry and it goes across with you	2711	B
that's really neat	2711	B
to work	2711	B
huh	2711	B
that's really wild	2711	B
huh	2711	B
hour and ten minutes	2711	B
yeah	2711	B
that's really interesting	2711	B
uh-huh	2711	B
yeah	2711	B
yeah	2711	B
it is	2711	B
i've been wanting to go to the West Texas and see different parts of Texas because i haven't lived here very long and i haven't really seen much	2711	B
so what are some good things in Texas to go visit	2711	B
Galveston	2711	B
uh-huh	2711	B
uh-huh	2711	B
yeah	2711	B
Boardwalk and all that	2711	B
yeah	2711	B
i've heard it's really pretty	2711	B
really	2711	B
yeah	2711	B
uh-huh	2711	B
down by Big Bend what's that	2711	B
okay	2711	B
yeah	2711	B
um	2711	B
uh-huh	2711	B
yeah	2711	B
i've heard to go to Austin too a lot people say to go down there -it's real	2711	B
what's there to see in Austin	2711	B
uh-huh	2711	B
have you ever been drug tested	2759	B
uh-huh	2759	B
yeah	2759	B
i had i've had uh two or three drug tests that i had to get before i could start working at a job	2759	B
uh different jobs i had one at TI and then one at another engineering company and	2759	B
really i mean i don't mind them i don't do drugs anyway i guess if i did maybe i would but	2759	B
um i don't know i know a girl that she's a nurse and they get drug tested randomly i've never been randomly drug tested	2759	B
but that would probably bother me to wake up one day and find out halfway through the day that you're going to be drug tested and you didn't know about it	2759	B
yeah i guess so	2759	B
i guess so	2759	B
do you think that it's right	2759	B
uh-huh	2759	B
right	2759	B
right	2759	B
that's true	2759	B
right	2759	B
that's true	2759	B
i believe it's right especially for certain jobs	2759	B
i think anyone in a in a public job like bus drivers and cab drivers and police officers and things like that i think they should be randomly drug tested i believe full force in that	2759	B
i don't know that i believe every secretary in every company needs to be	2759	B
you know secretaries aren't aren't really going to cost the company that much money if they fall face forward in their typewriter or something so	2759	B
i don't know i i'm kind of biased too because i don't do drugs and so i really don't care one way or another if anybody wants to pull me up tomorrow and test me because i have nothing to worry about	2759	B
so i guess that's kind of biased	2759	B
yeah it does	2759	B
yeah that's true	2759	B
yeah	2759	B
that's true	2759	B
but what do you do about the occasional user that may have gone to a party three days before and you know it's it's been the whole weekend since they've done anything and they happen to be tested Monday morning	2759	B
and they could be fired for that	2759	B
you know that that's kind of unfair also	2759	B
yeah i guess so i guess if you're going to do it you need to suffer the consequences	2759	B
that's true	2759	B
that's true	2759	B
that's true	2759	B
yeah i think so more than drugs	2759	B
and i know a lot of companies that will put you in an alcohol rehabilitation before they would put you in a drug rehab	2759	B
they would pay for an alcohol but they don't always pay for drug rehabilitation	2759	B
yeah	2759	B
that's true	2759	B
i think that's fair	2759	B
yeah	2759	B
that's true	2759	B
that's about all i have to say on it	2759	B
uh it's a urine test and they uh	2759	B
it was really very official you have to go in a room solely by yourself sign papers that say you were totally alone sign papers that say this is yours and	2759	B
and you have to fill the bottle yourself and label it yourself and all of that so that they're sure that you haven't borrowed anybody's i guess or something	2759	B
yeah i know i can't- it's hard to believe but i guess it does	2759	B
i know i'm amazed at the things people will do	2759	B
it is amazing i guess there are people that do that and they are those are expensive tests i'm glad i never had to pay for one	2759	B
yeah i guess so	2759	B
oh really	2759	B
how weird i didn't know that	2759	B
oh that's weird	2759	B
yeah	2759	B
that's wild	2759	B
it's amazing the things they can find out from different things on your body	2759	B
that's true i'm glad i never had to do that by giving blood i can't stand the thought of giving blood	2759	B
i can't even do it for Wadley even though it's a good cause	2759	B
well i enjoyed talking to you	2759	B
thank you	2759	B
bye bye	2759	B
all right	2759	A
um	2759	A
that's a good question um	2759	A
uh i had a job i had to go get a blood test for	2759	A
um and they and they did a full blood screen	2759	A
on me but they didn't call that a drug test so that- i think they checked for drugs they just don't tell you they did	2759	A
uh-huh	2759	A
uh-huh	2759	A
yeah	2759	A
well i guess it depends on if you got something to worry about	2759	A
well uh uh i i come from kind of a biased opinion because i'm a a therapist and a drug and alcohol counselor	2759	A
and i've done employee assistant work and	2759	A
i i know the the kind of cost businesses go through in terms of accidents on the job	2759	A
that are specifically drug and alcohol related and it's like in the billions of dollars every year	2759	A
um and the- the only way that they can prevent that is is you know making sure that the employees are drug and alcohol free	2759	A
and you know the the problem in the work place is that that people are	2759	A
like if your boss is your drinking buddy or whatever i mean you can come to come to work drunk and get in an accident and he'll cover up for you and nobody knows about it but could- you know ends up costing the company lots and lots of money	2759	A
so	2759	A
you know there	2759	A
uh-huh	2759	A
yeah	2759	A
yeah	2759	A
true	2759	A
uh-huh	2759	A
yeah	2759	A
yeah well and it's i i think one of the problems with it is it affects a lot of other folks on the job	2759	A
if somebody else is impaired because generally you know it um you find out one way or another	2759	A
if somebody's got a problem on the job	2759	A
and if even- even if like you say even if it's just the secretary if her work or abilities start affecting her coworkers then it it's still a problem	2759	A
so	2759	A
well yeah i guess it comes with the turf	2759	A
yeah and then you're	2759	A
in- in- in terms of	2759	A
drugs they're illegal so you're	2759	A
you're breaking the law anyway	2759	A
um probably the the biggest problem with those is they don't do a real good job of of assessing for alcohol	2759	A
and that's probably the biggest problem there is	2759	A
yeah	2759	A
uh-huh	2759	A
well i guess that's one of the positive things that has- has come out of it some of the employee assistance program if you do test positive for something	2759	A
they will give you an opportunity- opportunity- opportunity to go get your life straight rather than to lose your job	2759	A
and i think-	2759	A
yeah and i think the benefits- the company benefits in the long run	2759	A
what what kind of testing do they do when you went	2759	A
urine screen yeah	2759	A
uh-huh	2759	A
well that happens	2759	A
it happens a lot	2759	A
there there are people that know- pay other people for that	2759	A
to help them out	2759	A
yeah	2759	A
yeah	2759	A
yeah it depends really- really- really on how how strong a test it is they've got different degrees as far as as how far back they can check	2759	A
they got some unusual things besides blood and urine tests they've they've got some companies that are doing um hair tests	2759	A
yeah well that they'll pull out one of your hairs and they can apparently test	2759	A
um	2759	A
back a certain period of time	2759	A
um because um some of the the residue ends up in your hair follicles you know it's kind of	2759	A
hair follicles i guess are just dead protein and they	2759	A
and it it's apparently almost- almost like a a calendar they they've got it	2759	A
pretty precise now that they can go back and look at in terms of growth in a hair when you used and and that type of thing	2759	A
so	2759	A
yeah	2759	A
so i guess if they perfect that and then it's not quite as cumbersome as having to go fill a bottle or give blood or something like that	2759	A
uh-huh	2759	A
yeah	2759	A
well i did too	2759	A
uh-huh bye bye	2759	A
{alrighty} i think one of the most significant changes that have happened is that they've changed from homemaker to the work market and for several reasons probably some of that is divorce	2741	A
and some is they're more educated than they used to be i think	2741	A
um i think sometimes uh leaders in government they've become more uh adroit in that area too instead of just men all the time have more women in government	2741	A
and now i'll let you say something	2741	A
very limited	2741	A
uh-huh	2741	A
yes	2741	A
um-hum	2741	A
um-hum	2741	A
right	2741	A
i think that's right	2741	A
um-hum	2741	A
right	2741	A
i really think women have so much more responsibility than you know as far as everything	2741	A
and like you said um one women today have so many uh the average today of having a a single family you know with the mother as the head is just really um	2741	A
so commonplace nowadays	2741	A
uh-huh	2741	A
right right	2741	A
um-hum	2741	A
you know isn't that funny uh because the same thing happened to us except i was twelve and my mother had a nursing degree and was able to make it in her profession and was isn't that funny	2741	A
uh but just that they were able to do it you know and even today i think the chance for education is is so much uh better for all of our girls and and boys too but but the girls especially	2741	A
a lot of things yeah	2741	A
right	2741	A
yeah and i also think that in the future that uh it's gonna continue that we're not gonna see a lax off of women in the work force i think they're going to stay there and i think that they're gonna	2741	A
uh be really responsible and and do everything just like what you said you know make make it the grade and and make it so women can be the top people in their in their field	2741	A
oh i think so	2741	A
right	2741	A
right	2741	A
exactly exactly	2741	A
that's right and i think that is happening more and more i think it's just gonna take a little bit longer	2741	A
well great okay	2741	A
good to talk to you Sally thanks bye-bye	2741	A
okay	2741	B
um-hum	2741	B
um-hum	2741	B
um-hum	2741	B
um-hum	2741	B
well uh i probably a little bit older than you are so what i see um is the change that i see the most is the is that um	2741	B
women have much more many more occupations and careers to choose from than when i went- went to college when i went to college you could be a teacher or maybe a nurse or a secretary or	2741	B
but there were very few women in business at that time a few but they were the oddity and	2741	B
yes and now i see and and i see for my daughter which is wonderful she's thirteen and i see a whole wonderful world out there that she can choose from so many different jobs which i think is terrific because	2741	B
i'm a teacher and i mean i love teaching but though i think there are a lot of other things i would have liked better and um	2741	B
not that i would give the career up because it's it's a safe career plus because_1 i always have a job plus i am a single parent too and i and i need the income	2741	B
but uh and i think that's a reason why a lot of women have have started to work too is because economically it's just a must	2741	B
uh you just it's very difficult to get along on one income unless uh the male uh has an extraordinarily good job	2741	B
and especially men who teach school they don't make that much money and and most all they always either have they're either moonlighting or else their their wife works too	2741	B
um it's just an economic need now	2741	B
oh definitely	2741	B
um-hum	2741	B
oh yes exactly we have uh quite a few teachers at our school that are single parents and	2741	B
uh the majority is uh married couple with children but still there's a lot more than there used to be and see you never picture yourself in a situation like this when i married i thought i'd be married the rest of my life	2741	B
and uh but i'm all i'm really grateful that i went to college my mother always said you know get an education in case you need one because my father died when we were i have a twin sister and we were eleven when he died	2741	B
she had a nursing degree and she was able to make it but she said in just- you never know what's going to happen and i thank God that i did go to college and got a degree because otherwise i don't know how i would be able to raise my children	2741	B
isn't that something	2741	B
yes	2741	B
yes	2741	B
oh yes	2741	B
yeah i do too but i think it needs to continue to change and i mean- i think it there's still not equality as far as uh paychecks for men and women i think that the we still have a long way to go	2741	B
um-hum and i think that uh uh i think by the year two thousand it we're going to see some uh a lot more changes uh hopefully that women are you know able to get the the executive jobs and hold positions that men	2741	B
men do because they can do it just as well you know if they want to dedicate their uh most of their time to that they're they're they can do it	2741	B
hum-um	2741	B
exactly exactly and i think that's the way it should be i think it i mean not that i- i think that i'm equal to men because there's a lot of things that men can do that i	2741	B
could never do {strengthwise} and so forth but also there's some things women can do like have children that men can't do	2741	B
so you know it- it- i don't want- i don't want to be equal but i- i want to be i want to get what i deserve and i want to be able to be on the same level with them if i can do a job as well as i man i think i should get the same pay you know	2741	B
yeah and i just i'm not a women's libber i really am not but i- i think that well- that we have	2741	B
just as many rights as they do and i feel like if there's a qualified woman to do the job and if she's good or better than a man then she they should get the job with the same pay	2741	B
i do too	2741	B
oh i do too definitely definitely	2741	B
well it was good to talk to you	2741	B
all right bye-bye	2741	B
um-hum	2778	A
um-hum	2778	A
um-hum um-hum	2778	A
um-hum	2778	A
um-hum so do you recycle up those products	2778	A
uh-huh	2778	A
yeah yeah	2778	A
um-hum um-hum um-hum	2778	A
yeah probably	2778	A
well they're uh out i'm out in uh California recycling has been in for a while i mean it's yes it's very important now i think it's actually always been important we're just recognizing it now that things are starting to run out um	2778	A
it's um	2778	A
the main key to making recycling is to make it more convenient for people i think	2778	A
and	2778	A
the community i was just in not the one i just moved to uh had basically whenever you took your trash out you could just throw another bin of	2778	A
recyclable refuse out and not to be very you know you could have cans and aluminum cans and tin cans and bottles and everything and apparently they sorted it out	2778	A
which increased their labor costs tremendously	2778	A
but uh that sure made it easy i mean there was like no excuse not to recycle you just need two trash cans and if it's recyclable you throw it in one and if it's not you throw it in the other and take both out	2778	A
um so that seemed to have been working quite well um seems like the other thing to make recycling more viable is to make it more economically uh	2778	A
you know increase the economic incentive uh like news recycled- recycled newsprint isn't worth very much right now	2778	A
because there's a lot of it available and trees are still cheap	2778	A
so from a purely economic standpoint i'd say recycling- one way to increase- to increase the viability of recycling is to increase the cost of the raw materials	2778	A
uh through selective taxation or whatever currently most things like aluminum only cost what it costs the company to produce them	2778	A
um without any charge for you know long-term effects on the land or	2778	A
you know with with minimal- minimal taxation for replenishing- replenishing- replenishing the land after the mine is gone or	2778	A
health costs or all sorts of things like that or for that matter anytime you take aluminum out of the ground you can view it as you're stealing if from future generations	2778	A
and and no one ever pays them you know basically you run out of these things and uh	2778	A
and then you have to start using something else yeah it seems like we're using up a lot of the abundant materials- minerals right now i mean petroleum will be gone in about three decades	2778	A
at the rate we're going and it it just seems like increasing the raw cost of those would uh	2778	A
through you know more sensitivity of what the long term costs would be rather than just the extraction costs would	2778	A
yeah	2778	A
um-hum	2778	A
yeah	2778	A
uh uh-huh	2778	A
well things are changing i mean i've been really encouraged i've i mean i come from a family that's been recycling for thirty years	2778	A
and uh has always been you know concerned about these things and i'm just now starting to see you know significant social movement towards recycling	2778	A
um the community the Berkeley City Council coined a term called {precycling} which i liked which is the idea of well you can recycle all these little aluminum cans and all this and that but you can also	2778	A
purchase products in the first place which uh use less resources	2778	A
you know not buy those styrofoam cups not buy individual aluminum cans if you're going to buy soda but get some you know larger reusable cheaper container and things like that	2778	A
uh they call it precycling in other words keep {recycling} but minimize the original consumption too	2778	A
well it's funny because_1 plastic is incredibly recyclable	2778	A
um the problem is there's so many different types of plastic and they can't be mixed together	2778	A
but any one type of plastic can be recycled just about easier than anything because_1 it melts down real easily and so forth can be	2778	A
um there are a number of laws about that some things can't be recycled back into the same products for health concerns even though they're not scientifically valid health concerns	2778	A
i mean because_1 some you know anything will get killed when you melt down plastic uh	2778	A
but and other things made to be uh can go back you know glass can go back into glass bottles and stuff	2778	A
but if it's mixed plastic it can only go to certain uses it can make actually plastic lumber for like uh park benches and things like that out of mixed plastic	2778	A
uh-huh	2778	A
um-hum um-hum	2778	A
um-hum	2778	A
so if we can do more things with those that would be helpful	2778	A
yeah yeah and more efficient pickups and everything	2778	A
um-hum um-hum	2778	A
um-hum	2778	A
sure some kind of recycling chutes or something	2778	A
well that would be admirable i- i think that's wonderful	2778	A
well great uh oh the last thing as long as i've got an audience is the uh i really want to see more recycling of batteries	2778	A
because_1 batteries have all kinds of toxins in them_1 and they're quite recyclable and most people just throw them in the trash or they leak into the ground water or all kinds of stuff	2778	A
but most people aren't even aware that batteries are something you shouldn't throw away in the trash	2778	A
i mean like Japan it's illegal to throw batteries away in the trash	2778	A
well those are the worst defenders it's because_1 they're biggest but even some of the small ones	2778	A
need to be disposed of properly just your basic ten cell batteries um once they rust out there's some pretty nasty things in them especially_1 the mercury ones	2778	A
but um it's it's it's a regular trash item in this country	2778	A
um despite the fact that if you were if you were a company throwing that kind of stuff away the EPA could give you a major fine because it's a toxin	2778	A
okay well nice talking with you bye-bye	2778	A
i- i think that uh recycling is uh is real important right now or or you know for our future of the ecology and everything	2778	B
uh Richardson has uh started recently a newspaper recycling program	2778	B
where uh they pick up newspapers in their is they're part of the regular garbage pickup	2778	B
on uh Wednesdays every week	2778	B
and then we have recycling centers around you know for aluminum and glass and that kind of stuff	2778	B
well i have not uh	2778	B
i haven't been doing much in the way of glass and that kind of stuff i have started recycling aluminum cans because of	2778	B
you know i just keep those and then take them to one the sale there's a centers around that buy those	2778	B
and and yes i do stack the newspapers and put them out in the alley	2778	B
i did notice uh	2778	B
this Wednesday when i put them_1 out i must have gotten them_1 out late because they didn't pick them up so they probably picked them_1 up with the regular garbage yesterday	2778	B
yeah	2778	B
right	2778	B
right	2778	B
uh-huh	2778	B
yeah i guess that's a one way to look at it	2778	B
i guess uh i- my main concern with uh with the recycling is that we should be	2778	B
more geared to recycling or to eliminating the use of so much stuff that	2778	B
does not uh return to it's original uh is not biodegradable uh the plastics and the	2778	B
styrofoams and things like that uh i really think we need to to really concentrate a lot more on on limiting those- the use of those	2778	B
uh i'm finding i'm i'm almost offended when i go into a restaurant now and they try to give me a styrofoam cup for coffee or something you know	2778	B
but uh i think there's there's got to be a better way	2778	B
yeah	2778	B
um-hum	2778	B
right	2778	B
right yeah	2778	B
i guess that's a a good idea i do i would like to see uh we talk about buying the larger containers i'd like to see those larger containers not the	2778	B
uh not the plastic bottles i guess is the main thing	2778	B
right yeah	2778	B
yeah it's got to but it's got to go back to	2778	B
to the same product or is that is that the way it works	2778	B
yeah	2778	B
um-hum	2778	B
yeah	2778	B
yeah i saw a uh an advertisement on television yesterday for a garden hose it's a a soaker hose	2778	B
it's made out of recycled tires	2778	B
and uh i thought that was a was an interesting idea i had not	2778	B
i had not heard of that before but i you know i knew that tires were recycled quite you know quite a bit for different things	2778	B
right	2778	B
yeah	2778	B
yeah	2778	B
but uh i think- you know i think that uh that the future should be that uh home builders and you know designers and everybody should be	2778	B
really gearing you know the the home to have a recycling center in it	2778	B
and uh	2778	B
that's	2778	B
yeah	2778	B
we're uh my wife and i are are looking at you know designing a new house now and uh probably you know some years away before we'll be ready to build it but	2778	B
that uh that's one of the things that we're looking at is you know where we where are we going to put the recycling bins	2778	B
uh-huh	2778	B
right so uh we're going to have that designed you know where you know that in mind when we	2778	B
do our floor plans	2778	B
yeah	2778	B
yeah	2778	B
okay it's been	2778	B
oh yeah	2778	B
right	2778	B
yeah	2778	B
when you say batteries do you mean uh automobile batteries or	2778	B
so	2778	B
hum	2778	B
yeah	2778	B
yeah	2778	B
yeah so	2778	B
well that's uh that was some interesting ideas anyway and uh	2778	B
if i get a chance i'll uh pass those along okay uh-huh nice talking to you bye	2778	B
uh my first comments on the budget	2708	B
i would say there has	2708	B
surprisingly no	2708	B
i would i would cut the prison systems and let them self-support	2708	B
hm	2708	B
you mean the prisons	2708	B
i hadn't heard that	2708	B
right	2708	B
but to me	2708	B
well see the other way i'm thinking about is they should be self-supporting like um the prisoners make	2708	B
license plates or farm or small industry inside the prisons anything to where they can be self-supporting within themselves in other words they're in there for a purpose put them to work	2708	B
rather than sitting there it's the same thing like the whole criminal i shouldn't say criminal but the whole police department of the United States i feel the same way	2708	B
uh someone gets picked up for drunk driving he should put enough in there that goes back into paying for that policeman being out there	2708	B
so it's self defense- you know self-defense on that point	2708	B
um	2708	B
as far as my defense	2708	B
budget	2708	B
uh they're cutting it back now what twenty five percent i wouldn't want to see it cut any more than that	2708	B
but again i'd like to see something on the other end back into education but not in the education we have today	2708	B
so i'm lost on that one	2708	B
i would like to be a little more	2708	B
into investigating some of the other countries in the world and their educational problems	2708	B
and to come up with something a little better than what we've got	2708	B
well not so much pay i'm not trying to see the government put out any more	2708	B
yeah but see we don't even push the fact to the high school kids that there's other means of education out there rather than college	2708	B
to go either as an apprentice which they they do in other countries just doing this which i think would bring the education back up	2708	B
you know why not an apprentice out to a	2708	B
a company and learn from down on the bottom as a wood worker or	2708	B
you know just a technician	2708	B
you can learn on the job	2708	B
which of course again which mean- would mean again our education budget will go down if this is in a few years i mean it's not going to be overnight	2708	B
but that would come down	2708	B
excuse me i see it being done i know of a friend that works for my lawyer that has had no training whatsoever and she's training her	2708	B
yes wow	2708	B
yeah it sounded you were calling from around the world somewhere	2708	B
well-	2708	B
um-hum	2708	B
well that's something about what Germany's supposed to be doing something similar to that right now	2708	B
and uh they have jobs out on you know bulletin boards so people know what is open for an apprentices in different fields	2708	B
but see that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up our education with the people at people per at high school level	2708	B
which i would like to see rather than so many kids getting out of school they're they go on the unemployment list before we have turn around	2708	B
because they don't have any education i don't mean college and i'm for college but there's a lot of people that don't want their higher education as far as quote quote college is concerned they've had it	2708	B
um-hum	2708	B
oh yeah but	2708	B
there's a lot of them out there that haven't	2708	B
so that's	2708	B
well it seems to me that kids that are- get out of high school that parents have gone to college and college here and college there that are really not interested in going to college and forced into it	2708	B
usually are your drop outs where if they're said hey it's just as advisable to go into something you enjoy and you like	2708	B
because you can get just as far as being a journeyman carpenter or an electrician or plumber or anything else like that make as much money and if they enjoy it more they'll make a lot- happier life for themselves	2708	B
question you threw that question on me about the deficit put it on your shoe now what would you do	2708	B
were you watching i think uh one of the news stations i couldn't even tell you which one i watched but they had on there where the	2708	B
the output from the United States was basically from smaller businesses rather than the larger ones are exporting	2708	B
anyway what are your what are your first comments on that	2708	A
subject	2708	A
what would you start cutting first- what would be the first thing you'd cut	2708	A
defense	2708	A
mean private enterprise	2708	A
have private enterprise- enterprise do it	2708	A
uh-huh they're already talking about it i mean they're talking about um	2708	A
having it uh as a	2708	A
you know business	2708	A
uh to	2708	A
uh you know to so the you know the government doesn't have to deal with it	2708	A
but uh yeah because i think it's all funded either state or federally funded so or uh obviously- so	2708	A
but um	2708	A
but see they're	2708	A
they don't have enough um	2708	A
um	2708	A
you know there's there's not enough room in these prisons and that and that uh to continue funding it they think they need to	2708	A
maybe have uh you know private you know business	2708	A
private enterprise come in so	2708	A
um-hum	2708	A
um-hum	2708	A
yeah	2708	A
um-hum	2708	A
yeah its tough to to say what um	2708	A
you know what uh as far as this that good or bad or what but uh i was just talking to somebody else and	2708	A
all those European countries they pay all the way through college and stuff like that	2708	A
they so uh	2708	A
no yeah i know what you are saying but i'm just saying that even the differences uh is that you know some countries pay for students to go to through college and etcetera but here	2708	A
it you know it's just up to high school	2708	A
hum-um	2708	A
um-hum	2708	A
yeah	2708	A
i think the program- you know that's one reason uh	2708	A
you know we do have the education is that what it takes for these companies to bring somebody on board uh	2708	A
they're not willing to you know to put that you know	2708	A
the training for only a certain amount so	2708	A
um it's you know	2708	A
as far as the technical side	2708	A
but uh	2708	A
even like one one of the biggest things now is like	2708	A
paralegals and stuff i mean they they're trying to get more people into that field but they can't just bring somebody in	2708	A
without even having gone to you know school in that area before they can work	2708	A
you know for a lawyer as a paralegal	2708	A
um-hum well yeah i i'm well yeah- i you know i'm assuming that it can be done uh my perspective is that you know i've been with a couple of big companies now and it's like they'd are unwilling to put the time in	2708	A
you know they want somebody you know when they then when they bring them off	2708	A
bring them in that they have something you know a certain amount to contribute obviously there's uh uh you know there's a lot to learn	2708	A
uh after that but	2708	A
but uh that's true i'm i'm sure there's a lot of um	2708	A
you know businesses are small you know small businesses that could uh let me change my channel i've got a cordless phone let me see if that clears this up	2708	A
is that better	2708	A
okay	2708	A
and-	2708	A
yeah it was a cordless phone and all of a sudden we had a bad uh frequency there or something so we had some interference so i changed that	2708	A
anyway so um	2708	A
but uh you know i think uh	2708	A
they maybe they need to uh help promote that more give incentives like uh if they do bring somebody on they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is you know for them to train people	2708	A
you know stuff like that programs like that you know i don't know you know what kind of options they've got	2708	A
uh-huh	2708	A
um-hum	2708	A
yeah i think i just heard something the other day it was like only	2708	A
it was either sixty percent or forty percent	2708	A
go to college	2708	A
and then out of that percentage only so many	2708	A
can get their degree	2708	A
so i thought that was interesting	2708	A
but uh you know most people i knew have gone and got their degree so	2708	A
yeah well i just- you know i uh was basic in a you know middle upper middle class area and	2708	A
yeah so i think uh that demographic area there you know a lot of them do go on	2708	A
and they go to college etcetera	2708	A
yeah	2708	A
well as as far as the you know the deficit that's a whole nother	2708	A
uh my perception of the budget you know the government and they have so much to spend and there's not enough money to spread around but the deficit basically is that the trade surplus between the other countries	2708	A
and that we have more money or goods- you know more money going out and too many goods coming into this country you know and um	2708	A
you know part of that problem i think is still you know uh like Japan still does not let us compete fairly in their country	2708	A
and and obviously the the demand for their goods is quite high here so they can get their goods in here	2708	A
and um you know to start even that out we need to continue to you know at least threaten that you know we're going to give them higher tariffs etcetera to raise their prices to you know ours	2708	A
but um	2708	A
it's just that uh	2708	A
they're in	2708	A
i think you're you're going to find that just because the United States you know there is such a demand here the market you know and uh	2708	A
uh the money- you know money being spent and the goods flow in and we don't sell you know we don't uh	2708	A
sell products abroad as much as we bring in so	2708	A
hum-um	2708	A
okay	2766	B
okay	2766	B
i guess so	2766	B
oh dear that's a hard one that's really hard for me because	2766	B
uh you know i really i have a son that's sixteen and i think you know eventually you know he'll be of of drafting age and i think oh gosh do i want him to go and yet i'm proud to be an American and i know that we have a	2766	B
a country that you know people would give anything to live in a lot of people anyway because we have so many wonderful things that they don't have and yet i don't know whether i'd be willing to give his life for for this country and yet	2766	B
and yet i know that i that and i- i when i was in school it was always the tired the tired excuse that we went to war to save us against communism	2766	B
but i'm not sure that- that that's the reason anymore	2766	B
i mean not sure that communism is is as strong as it once was and i'm not sure that that that's the reason why we're involved- like we were in Vietnam supposedly so	2766	B
well with the	2766	B
well it's because of oil isn't it	2766	B
um-hum	2766	B
oh yes i agree with that	2766	B
oh yeah well yeah he's uh a bad person very definitely	2766	B
yeah	2766	B
oh sure sure	2766	B
um-hum	2766	B
um-hum	2766	B
um-hum	2766	B
yeah many years	2766	B
um-hum	2766	B
well	2766	B
um-hum	2766	B
certainly but what at at what cost you know that's the the thing it came out wonderfully- it came out wonderfully supposedly i mean everything is and we won	2766	B
yeah and that that's wonderful but what if if that wasn't the case what if we would have lost thousands of young men would that would it have been too much of a price to pay for that i don't know and i think there are a lot of things that we don't know but	2766	B
the American people	2766	B
oh sure well and there's a lot that we	2766	B
yeah i think that's true but i think there's a lot that we the public doesn't need to know i think there's some things that we shouldn't know just for national national security sake	2766	B
and i you know i think that if we did know i think there would be a a lot more chaos than there is because i don't i don't think people could handle it so i think there are things that we should not know that the masses shouldn't know but i also agree that there are a lot of crooks and liars too	2766	B
um-hum	2766	B
um-hum	2766	B
um-hum	2766	B
um-hum	2766	B
um-hum	2766	B
oh my gosh oh	2766	B
oh i have a lawyer background yeah have a law background you're right	2766	B
yeah that's true yeah that's true	2766	B
see and i don't know i don't know i can't tell the future that's what scares me so much about it i mean i thought the war was going to go on and on i really was surprised when it ended so quickly and	2766	B
i know yeah	2766	B
um-hum um-hum	2766	B
right	2766	B
um-hum um-hum	2766	B
um right	2766	B
um-hum	2766	B
yeah they're right they were	2766	B
oh sure sure	2766	B
um-hum	2766	B
um-hum	2766	B
yeah yeah	2766	B
yeah that is very it's very strange uh and yet you know see that's another thing that that's difficult for Americans their culture is so much different than ours that	2766	B
you know i've heard from many people that we could not even begin- begin to understand how they feel about things because their values and their perceptions are so much different than ours	2766	B
and um they just don't think the same way we do their culture is completely different and almost opposite	2766	B
um-hum	2766	B
yeah that's true	2766	B
huh i didn't realize that	2766	B
oh my word	2766	B
hum yeah see and that's another question you have to ask is this our job is are we should we still be there even you know	2766	B
i don't know the answers to that those questions i think they're tough and i think you know it's i don't know that anybody knows the answers i think they know what they believe but i'm not sure they really are one hundred percent sure	2766	B
um-hum	2766	B
you're kidding that's unreal	2766	B
no	2766	B
no and don't plan on having one either ever so	2766	B
oh i'd love to have one but you know	2766	B
sure sure that's right that's right	2766	B
uh no i wasn't i didn't wasn't aware of that no	2766	B
for doing nothing yeah	2766	B
um-hum um-hum	2766	B
we're supposed to talk about the Middle East crisis and should we be involved and uh what's it going to cost us in the long run	2766	A
are you ready	2766	A
the Middle East crisis should we be there	2766	A
well you realize why we were	2766	A
in the Middle East why we invaded Iraq why we were in Saudi why we attacked Kuwait and why we're why we are still fighting Iraq	2766	A
no i really believe it's because	2766	A
i think it has something to do with oil don't get me wrong	2766	A
but Saddam is Saddam is a madman	2766	A
anyone that would	2766	A
use chemical weapons to fight his own people	2766	A
and	2766	A
obviously that has something to do with it	2766	A
and	2766	A
and if you know i can see that	2766	A
he was in Kuwait	2766	A
Kuwait was the non aggressor	2766	A
and	2766	A
the Saudis are our allies	2766	A
we have several treaties and several alliances	2766	A
with the Saudis that range back for probably forty years	2766	A
you know they've been our friends through thick and thin	2766	A
they were at the Saudi border	2766	A
and ready to storm into Saudi	2766	A
shouldn't we try and help our friends	2766	A
what did we lose forty one Americans lives	2766	A
oh of course our government is full of liars thieves and crooks	2766	A
and that's our own fault because we elected them	2766	A
you know	2766	A
it's uh	2766	A
i went on jury duty here not long back	2766	A
and uh	2766	A
one of the	2766	A
guys that was on the jury they were asking him if if you could believe a lawyer or if a lawyer's reputation was so tainted that he couldn't be believed	2766	A
and one guy being selected	2766	A
snickered and couldn't keep his head up you know and	2766	A
guy said well can you share it with us what what you find so funny he says well i already told you my sons a lawyer	2766	A
he said that when he graduated the day after he passed his bar examine there in Houston	2766	A
he told him	2766	A
dad you know how to tell when a lawyers lying to you his lips are moving	2766	A
and ninety percent of all politicians are lawyers	2766	A
so by definition all lawyers and politicians are liars	2766	A
the fact that they take our money	2766	A
and don't do what we think is right makes them_1 thieves	2766	A
so what's it going to cost us in the long run there in Saudi	2766	A
are we going to lose more lives there	2766	A
well we hit them	2766	A
with more	2766	A
in one month	2766	A
than we used in three years the last three years of Vietnam	2766	A
and whenever	2766	A
you strike on open terrain with that sheer volume	2766	A
there's	2766	A
nothing they can do about it	2766	A
you know it's not like we	2766	A
threw	2766	A
eight aircraft over there all by ourselves and said this is wrong	2766	A
we were there the Brits were there the French were there this is with UN backing	2766	A
and to some level even Russia was behind us	2766	A
so	2766	A
honestly if	2766	A
there is was	2766	A
a well perceived war world wide this was it	2766	A
but	2766	A
what i can't understand is	2766	A
then many of the Kuwaiti youth	2766	A
didn't fight wouldn't fight	2766	A
it's okay for us to go expend our	2766	A
youth's	2766	A
lives like so much water in the desert	2766	A
and it's not their job to fight for their own land	2766	A
and really from all i can indicate- from all indications the Iraqi	2766	A
beliefs if you will	2766	A
are more similar to our own	2766	A
and	2766	A
the Kuwaitis aren't even helping rebuild their own country	2766	A
the Kuwaiti	2766	A
young	2766	A
won't rebuild anything they won't work	2766	A
yeah it was on the news last night	2766	A
the uh	2766	A
US Army is doing it all	2766	A
well they talked to uh one Kuwaiti woman yesterday	2766	A
and her biggest concern in life was	2766	A
that she couldn't get a housekeeper	2766	A
and do you have a housekeeper	2766	A
well i wouldn't mind having one	2766	A
but you know i'd like to uh make sure that i have a job tomorrow first	2766	A
it it astound you realize that the Kuwaiti government gives every Kuwaiti man woman and child money	2766	A
for nothing	2766	A
for nothing- for- for for doing nothing for sitting on there keisters	2766	A
ooh that ought to give their programming trouble shouldn't it	2766	A
uh	2766	A
they do nothing they hand them money each year and they're part of	2766	A
hi	2743	B
well the only thing we've taken back recently are plants shrubbery that were guaranteed and we had no problem with it we got our money- got our money back	2743	B
well	2743	B
i believe they're better	2743	B
i think so i don't think that shoddy not as shoddy electrical appliances i think are pretty good reliable- reliable	2743	B
right	2743	B
oh did you return it	2743	B
no	2743	B
uh-huh	2743	B
huh so either you or your husband can be warm but not both	2743	B
oh	2743	B
no huh-uh did they replace it	2743	B
uh-huh Wal-Mart i was going to say it must have been Wal-Mart	2743	B
i haven't bought any new clothes- well	2743	B
the last thing i bought was a dress last summer	2743	B
and the buttons turned on it over- over the winter the buttons tarnished slightly and i have not gone back about it	2743	B
i think it is too and it was an expensive dress	2743	B
yes it was	2743	B
that's right that's what i think too and one belt loop the one- um you know like the chain link chain belt loop	2743	B
half of it raveled out	2743	B
and that was i believe a Leslie Faye dress and it was	2743	B
i think over a hundred dollars	2743	B
yep i don't usually but i did that one	2743	B
but i think it should've been better than that for that money is what i mean	2743	B
okay i think so	2743	B
good talking to you too i've enjoyed it ah	2743	B
well we'll be talking to you later bye-bye	2743	B
okay hi Norma have you uh taken anything back lately uh that you've bought	2743	A
well why	2743	A
very good	2743	A
good well what- do you think that uh consumer goods goods are generally getting better or worse in quality	2743	A
i do too	2743	A
i believe about ten years ago that we went through a terrible time	2743	A
but i don't i- i believe that they're better now than they were	2743	A
however i didn't like it very well when the transmission went out on my car with sixty three thousand miles on it	2743	A
and i don't like it very well if when my electric blanket that was only one year old went out at uh on one side	2743	A
no i had moved away	2743	A
i had taken the first one back i didn't think that it heated well enough it never did get anything but just moderately warm	2743	A
took it back and um the people told me well that's the way it's supposed to be and i fell for it and uh when i got this one	2743	A
it did a little- it heated a little bit warmer and then after one year it started heating only on one side	2743	A
also i took an iron back after having it only one year	2743	A
now i figure that- uh anybody that is dumb enough to iron	2743	A
needs to have an iron that will last a long time and one year of ironing only once a week is not long enough for it to last	2743	A
well without even any question but i think it was the store	2743	A
Wal-Mart	2743	A
yes and uh well- well have you been buying any clothes lately any new clothes	2743	A
that was poor quality i think	2743	A
i wondered if it weren't expensive and they should have put buttons on it that would last forever	2743	A
yes	2743	A
the	2743	A
do- you spend that much on your dresses	2743	A
you're really divulging very personal information	2743	A
oh of course i do too	2743	A
well i believe that we've been talking about five minutes and Norma it is just wonderful to talk to you	2743	A
you are a good one to talk about consumer goods because you keep up on it all the time	2743	A
bye-bye	2743	A
what's uh	2733	A
right now we i've got a uh four year old Subaru and a two year old Honda	2733	A
oh goodness	2733	A
really	2733	A
um-hum	2733	A
uh-huh	2733	A
i bet i bet	2733	A
yep	2733	A
um-hum	2733	A
no	2733	A
um-hum	2733	A
um-hum i-	2733	A
well yeah we had uh we had these are the first cars that my husband and i have ever purchased ourselves the others were hand-me-downs through the families	2733	A
and those were always GM cars uh Buicks and Chevrolets and um we were real happy with them_1 but all the ones that we ever had were the you know eight cylinder	2733	A
really rugged GM cars	2733	A
and all we had heard was was a lot of negative press about the smaller cars and we both drive well forty five miles round trip every day	2733	A
and so we wanted a smaller car when we got ready to buy we needed a smaller car to get better gas mileage and quite frankly we were afraid of the of the GM small cars	2733	A
you know as far as durability so we kind of	2733	A
when- when we had our larger cars we didn't mind um	2733	A
keeping them up you know doing the maintenance and everything on them as long as we didn't have to do it very often	2733	A
but once they got over a hundred thousand miles on them_1 all of them_1 you know it just kind of seemed to be the magic number for them_1	2733	A
yeah exactly-	2733	A
um-hum	2733	A
um-hum	2733	A
right	2733	A
um-hum	2733	A
it's like a yacht	2733	A
yeah what we had- we sold our our we we traded in our Le Sabre for our Subaru	2733	A
yeah it was a great car it just we ran- ran the wheels right off of it	2733	A
um-hum	2733	A
um-hum	2733	A
that's right	2733	A
um-hum	2733	A
um-hum	2733	A
hm	2733	A
no i wouldn't wanna have to pay for the gas either	2733	A
um-hum	2733	A
um-hum	2733	A
it's a nice car	2733	A
no time soon um we're	2733	A
our our kids- we won't have anymore licensed drivers for about thirteen years yes so we um so we don't plan on purchasing anymore anytime soon both of our cars are getting	2733	A
oh around sixty thousand miles on them_1 we drive a lot	2733	A
um-hum	2733	A
um-hum	2733	A
a pickup	2733	A
um-hum	2733	A
um-hum	2733	A
really	2733	A
um-hum	2733	A
i think that'd be a good idea	2733	A
yeah i've we've	2733	A
we've we've kind of been the types that will say this is what we intend to spend this is the car we want will you sell me this car for that price	2733	A
um-hum	2733	A
um-hum	2733	A
um-hum	2733	A
um-hum	2733	A
goodness	2733	A
that's right	2733	A
well what what kind of cars do you drive- do you usually drive	2733	B
oh my goodness well we're we're we're sort of sort of a General Motors family i guess that's the way we were raised	2733	B
and uh uh we were overseas for TI for a number of years and when we came back we suddenly find out we've got five licensed drivers in the family	2733	B
yeah and four cars and we bought some year old cars from National Car Rental at- at least two of them we bought an Olds Calais and a Buick Skylark	2733	B
uh for you know they each had twenty one thousand miles or something like that and turns out that's a pretty good place to buy cars because they maintain them_1 and they can show you the records they've gotten all their maintenance on schedule and everything like that	2733	B
uh then we've got an eighty six Chevy Spectrum that we bought new my daughter was a freshman in college when we bought it for her	2733	B
and we've got a eighty four Toyota that we bought used so we've got four cars for our five licensed drivers it's like musical chairs	2733	B
yeah one short and uh but you know it's interesting the two even though my dad uh was a Chevrolet man forever and ever ever and we were in the retail milk business and he had all Chevrolet milk trucks and	2733	B
and we bought automobiles and all that and it was almost like and a Chevrolet dealer was our friend and it was almost like the minute we got old and bought anything like a but a Chevrolet it'd be like going and spitting on his grave but uh	2733	B
and we got older and got away and then we thought well you know you still could buy General Motors products and it was probably not that bad but uh we lived in Malaysia for TI in nineteen uh eighty one two three and four	2733	B
and uh we bought a uh we lived in the Philippines for TI in eighty five eighty six and eighty seven and we bought a uh Ford Telstar which is somewhat similar to the Taurus it's sold in the in uh the Far Eastern countries- Far East countries more	2733	B
then here but we really liked that and have you had experience with cars other than the ones you've had	2733	B
um-hum	2733	B
yeah	2733	B
yeah	2733	B
um-hum	2733	B
oh yeah the big- the big yeah	2733	B
um-hum	2733	B
sure sure	2733	B
yeah	2733	B
um-hum um-hum	2733	B
right	2733	B
um-hum	2733	B
yeah	2733	B
yeah yeah it seems that something goes every month	2733	B
and i'm afraid we're gonna be in that in another year with all of ours you know we got three eighty sixes and an eighty four and we'll probably be there with all of them_1 you know it's the same thing you know i don't know whether you uh classify the Skylark and the Calais as small i guess they're intermediates	2733	B
uh but uh we went on a family trip to Massachusetts and there were five of us and uh five five of us never go anywhere together here	2733	B
everybody- everybody's heading off in their own direction and i rented a Buick Le Sabre	2733	B
and it's the first big car i had since i had my nine passenger Impala station wagon from seventy six to eighty and it made all the i- i had forgotten what driving a big car was like	2733	B
it was just nice it floated	2733	B
oh yeah	2733	B
yeah	2733	B
yeah yeah and	2733	B
and uh you know i've read i'm in the quality business at TI i'm a quality manager and we're we're uh we deal we sell i'm in the semiconductor group and we sell to uh Ford Chrysler and GM uh GM Delco	2733	B
and there is a amazing i am just uh really impressed with the with the quality consciousness that these- those- these companies have put into their procurement and it's uh it's come about as a result of the competition from the Japanese	2733	B
and uh uh i and you know we used to think Ford products were tinny i mean i was growing up	2733	B
that Ford is putting on us and the way they come into our plants and they're really	2733	B
uh uh stressing this partnerships in quality and you know GM and Chrysler are doing that but i really think Ford's got a leadership- -leadership position in this right now and i think it's showing up in their automobiles their automobiles are getting a very good quality reputation right now	2733	B
and uh uh we went to uh Austin a while back to a basketball tournament and we were gonna be meeting some of my wife's relatives down there so we decided rather than drive one of our cars down we'd rent	2733	B
one and we went up to the local Budget and we were gonna get a Olds Eighty Eight or something he said i'll tell you what for a dollar a day more i'll give you a Lincoln Towncar	2733	B
and we drove that down and i hated to turn that back in when we got back we had that for three days and i absolutely loved- except i wouldn't wanna have to park it in tight places all the time	2733	B
uh but i absolutely loved that automobile and you know it wasn't that i'd driving around down there we might have got sixteen to eighteen miles per gallon but on the trip down and back i filled up	2733	B
both coming and going so i knew what i actually got on the trip and it was about twenty four miles a gallon	2733	B
uh and you know we just got it out on the highway and put it in cruise control at about sixty and let it let it float	2733	B
and it was pretty nice are you- are you are you planning on getting any additional or other cars	2733	B
hm oh yeah yours is small	2733	B
um-hum	2733	B
oh yeah yeah you probably got another another thirty or forty thousand if you maintain them_1 uh	2733	B
we've got probably we'll get something in the next couple years my son will graduate from high school this year and and he's gonna go to Richland College one year behind us	2733	B
it's right you know in fact our house is adjacent- adjacent to the Richland property he wants to go to Texas Tech and he's probably gonna have to go to Richland a year to get some grades in order but uh the next year when he goes out to Tech he wants a pickup	2733	B
and i want a pickup i may get one and not let him have it but we have been looking at these red Chevrolet- they they're very popular around here	2733	B
these uh red- uh red Chevy pickups and uh we'll probably do something like that uh uh incidentally uh	2733	B
uh i don't know uh the uh the credit union has got a deal now where you decide what you want and you call this number and uh they go negotiate the price for you	2733	B
and and or or send you to a guy with whom they've already got a deal	2733	B
and uh my boss just bought a Chevy pickup and he got three thousand dollars off the sticker price doing it this way	2733	B
yeah and uh uh you know you you figure out the options go around look at the dealers and get the best price you can and then go call this guy and and tell him what you want and he'll put you in touch with a certain guy a certain person at that dealer's place	2733	B
so i'm gonna try that the next time i buy one	2733	B
and and so you know i can go around and comparison shop and see if i can get a better negotiation on my own but once uh one thing that's a pain in the neck buying automobiles is negotiating	2733	B
yeah	2733	B
yeah	2733	B
and for that price	2733	B
we'll go somewhere else yeah	2733	B
yeah and uh and i- i think that's probably the way you got to do it when when i was young	2733	B
i went in and bought a uh or made a deal on a sixty this is nineteen sixty i'd first come to Texas and made a deal on a sixty red Impala convertible	2733	B
that i just loved and this guy gave me this deal you know i told how much i wanted to pay and for every fifty dollars he'd have to go in and check with the boss and then i'd have to sign something saying that if he could get this rate	2733	B
uh we would go ahead and buy uh uh if he could get this rate i promised to buy and i left there on a Saturday afternoon just totally exhausted i- i was only twenty five years old or something and i- i left there and i	2733	B
i uh i'd never done this before because_1 i'd always bought my previous cars from the guy my dad bought his milk trucks from and uh uh so	2733	B
i- i got back and a salesman that lived in the apartment i did asked me uh uh if he'd heard i was gonna get a car and asked me what i paid for it he said well hey uh before you go buying anything he says call this friend of mine at Will's Point	2733	B
it was a guy that owned a Chevrolet dealership up there and i called the guy and made an appointment to come up Monday morning	2733	B
and just driving fifty miles out of town it was a difference and i mean it was a difference of four hundred dollars but this was four hundred dollars on only twenty five hundred is all we paid for cars in those days and uh	2733	B
uh so i called back the guy in Dallas and i told him that i'd left him a check for tax title and license and everything and i said i wanna cancel my order and and don't try to cash the check because_1 i'm gonna i've stopped payment on it already	2733	B
and he says oh somebody's taking he said what did you get a deal for Bill and i told him he says somebody's taking you for a ride and i said no somebody took me for a ride	2733	B
last Saturday and uh uh and i- i find that uh and for the longest time then i drove up to Will's Point and the and the and the fellow died since then and and some of his relatives taken over the business and- but and since then i hadn't really-	2733	B
um-hum	2722	B
sure	2722	B
and then if something that struck your fancy then you pay attention more to that kind of topic then when you get the newspaper	2722	B
um-hum um-hum	2722	B
um-hum yes	2722	B
well basically the same thing i- i know uh my husband's favorite radio station in all the world is KRLD	2722	B
i do want to keep up and know what's going on and	2722	B
it helps i don't often uh have time to sit down and watch the evening news kind of thing but	2722	B
if i'm around during the daytime and have a chance i'll switch on CNN	2722	B
always have watched CNN ever since we	2722	B
got the cable	2722	B
uh you know coverage that provided for that and have always enjoyed it and am glad to see them getting a little uh boost these days since the uh war a little more uh recognition and credibility	2722	B
i've i uh	2722	B
have access to Time and Newsweek and The Wall Street Journal all of which i	2722	B
rely on more i think than what i get over network	2722	B
TV news	2722	B
and like you you know knowledgeable friends i work for a fellow who is uh in the oil industry internationally	2722	B
and travels a lot to third world countries and all around and i feel like a lot of times what we get from his contacts is far more valid	2722	B
then you know but that's only in a real specialized area you know that's not- that's just political it's not the medical arena it's not technology particularly although sometimes it overlaps	2722	B
into those kinds of things but i don't think i would be satisfied if all i had was just television	2722	B
you know the uh the newspapers i think	2722	B
you know they uh i think a lot of the meat of what i get out out of the newspaper's not on the front page	2722	B
yeah yeah i uh	2722	B
i have really enjoyed being able to have access to that the last couple of years it uh	2722	B
yes	2722	B
um-hum um-hum	2722	B
well and you know you just take a a newspaper just your your regular daily average big city newspaper	2722	B
there's more information in one	2722	B
than an entire month magazine you know monthly periodical	2722	B
and	2722	B
a lot of times i'll just take the whole thing soon as i get it and i take out the sections i want trash the rest otherwise you like you say the the stack of paper is so large	2722	B
it's unmanageable just in your home situation	2722	B
you know	2722	B
um-hum	2722	B
that's right yeah	2722	B
i- i'm not familiar with that one	2722	B
um-hum um-hum	2722	B
uh-huh	2722	B
well i'm a nonfiction oriented kind of person anyway oh i enjoy a good novel	2722	B
but you know given the choice in the doctor's office when they're all lined up i'm much more apt to grab the	2722	B
Time or Newsweek or US News and World Reports than i ever would People or	2722	B
McCall's or although i've you know i read those kinds of things too occasionally and and and find things that are current and	2722	B
updated but i don't know i just just my particular	2722	B
predisposition i	2722	B
i tend more the other way so i try not to ever find myself in a situation without something to read because my reading time comes in	2722	B
little snatches i have five kids	2722	B
so by the time i get around to	2722	B
actually reading i have- you know i may have ten or fifteen minutes of slot	2722	B
to read so	2722	B
uh-huh	2722	B
well they're good kids	2722	B
and this you know this is another reason though i think that ah	2722	B
makes me real aware and encouraging because i know there's always a a a tidbit of information that's going to come across some	2722	B
i'm either gonna read it or i'm gonna hear it that they can turn right around and use in a report	2722	B
so if i hear a statistic that's interesting or whatnot even just driving in the car i'll make a little note and uh	2722	B
you know of where that came from and the time i heard it and whatnot so they can use that in a bibliography	2722	B
i hope so i hope so i think kids tend to watch news for the sensationalism	2722	B
my kids love to watch the news but it's not always you know you wonder if it's for the right reason	2722	B
yeah yeah but i think it's a good habit to	2722	B
to establish uh	2722	B
thank you so much and uh	2722	B
i'll uh just be anxious to tell my daughter's friend that there's a nice lady out there	2722	B
well my daughter hopes to come visit before too long so we're uh we're anxious to point that way sometime take care and have a good day	2722	B
bye-bye	2722	B
okay	2722	A
i will i guess i will start and say that i keep up uh with current events	2722	A
mostly from three or four areas	2722	A
and i'll tell you what they are and uh then you uh would you please uh tell me how you do it	2722	A
i think i keep up better with what's going on in the world from the newspaper but i usually am introduced to subjects by television	2722	A
exactly in more detail	2722	A
i also take uh Time magazine and i enjoy that a lot and uh i get a lot of uh i think pretty good detail there	2722	A
and uh i'm pretty i'm pretty satisfied with i think those and some friends who are who are very knowledgeable	2722	A
and how how do you	2722	A
yes	2722	A
yes	2722	A
yes	2722	A
yes	2722	A
wonderful	2722	A
of course	2722	A
no	2722	A
i think that's right too well especially The Wall Street Journal	2722	A
don't you find though that it's hard to find time	2722	A
to yeah to the reading is The Wall Street Journal if i don't read it the day that it comes in then if they start piling up on me then i have to just forget about about it usually	2722	A
yes	2722	A
really	2722	A
it really is and especially if you're trying to	2722	A
save papers for recycling	2722	A
just terrible job	2722	A
but uh i think i enjoy uh Time and i- i get Insight and i don't like that magazine very much	2722	A
it looks like a little Time	2722	A
but it is not written as well as Time staff uh writers do	2722	A
but i- i like some of those magazines because they just choose certain subjects i guess	2722	A
and deal with a	2722	A
uh	2722	A
well	2722	A
yes	2722	A
right	2722	A
i guess you have five children well	2722	A
uh	2722	A
oh well of course	2722	A
exactly	2722	A
well you are passing good information on to them aren't you	2722	A
yes	2722	A
right	2722	A
they've heard it though	2722	A
sure it is	2722	A
it has been nice talking to you	2722	A
enjoyed it a great deal	2722	A
there really is it's beautiful	2722	A
it really is beautiful you will enjoy- i know she will enjoy it	2722	A
oh	2722	A
good	2722	A
thank you you too	2722	A
okay	2754	B
well uh anyways i'm not exactly sure i i wasn't really uh paying attention as to what particular uh parts of capital punishment we're supposed to talk about but it was uh basically what's your views on whether you thought there was certain cases that should be used that sort of thing	2754	B
right and uh	2754	B
i don't know i've i've always thought that any uh crime that uh	2754	B
that uh intentionally where someone goes out and premeditatively takes another life	2754	B
would be the ones where i think that capital punishment would be necessary to keep that person from perhaps uh doing it again and even more so to get people on the outside who are professionals to realize that	2754	B
you know there's a a very steep penalty to uh be paid	2754	B
when that's done	2754	B
and uh	2754	B
yeah how do you feel about it	2754	B
uh-huh	2754	B
uh-huh	2754	B
uh-huh	2754	B
right exactly	2754	B
uh-huh	2754	B
right if the if the evidence wasn't overwhelming right	2754	B
uh-huh	2754	B
well i think that should be likewise decided by the jury you know because	2754	B
i don't know i think a jury would be less likely to just send a man to death just for any reason i don't know a judge might be a little more cold-blooded about it	2754	B
yeah i don't think we	2754	B
no huh-uh	2754	B
no we don't	2754	B
yeah	2754	B
uh-huh	2754	B
oh yeah they're always doing it in Florida Florida and Louisiana i think and uh some of the other southern states	2754	B
but they have such a crime problem because they have such a unemployment- unemployment rate you get that unemployment way up so then people you know tend towards crime and then they they start stiffening the penalties	2754	B
well in Florida seems like uh two or three times a year it's constantly on the	2754	B
yeah	2754	B
no that's true course they have a requirement that uh that every single appeal must be permitted	2754	B
so of course the the attorneys take them through the whole chain	2754	B
you know even if the case is open and closed they go all the way up to the Supreme Court you know	2754	B
they almost always get thrown right back out again but they have to have every single appeal made open to them	2754	B
and you know it's sort of strange because it almost	2754	B
it almost seems like the attorneys are doing it for the money or something because i mean the guy knows that	2754	B
whether it's	2754	B
you know a a month or two or six years he's still going to get you know the chair when it comes around	2754	B
you know	2754	B
some of these guys are	2754	B
really uh	2754	B
you know violent Son of Sam killers and stuff like that you know	2754	B
i mean they everyone knows they're going get not going to get out	2754	B
yeah	2754	B
uh-huh	2754	B
uh-huh	2754	B
i think so uh a lot of the the the other violent crimes i don't really feel that strongly about although you know stiffer sentences and lessening the effects of parole i mean	2754	B
these guys are certainly not going to uh be they can't i mean they're getting into drugs and fights and all that stuff in prison i don't think the parole system is really helping that much	2754	B
reduce the violence in the prisons i think that's its only purpose	2754	B
is	2754	B
is you know to reduce uh the violence in the prisons so people behave themselves a little bit better if they think they're going to get off early	2754	B
off earlier but some of these guys just don't care you know	2754	B
and so uh	2754	B
yeah right uh-huh	2754	B
um that's possible i guess	2754	B
um so where do you live in Pennsylvania	2754	B
oh okay i don't think i really know that	2754	B
because uh you know that all depends too on where you are at that's uh sort of interesting to get opinions as to where different parts of the country are because_1 the more grass root country uh parts of the country tend to	2754	B
to support capital punishment where the places that are you know less in contact with crime you know the the more more urban i mean less	2754	B
uh-huh	2754	B
two hours where	2754	B
oh okay near Polk	2754	B
Polk Institute	2754	B
it's uh an old uh university that turned into a place for the mentally retarded uh	2754	B
very old uh historical place there	2754	B
Sharon Pennsylvania's up there	2754	B
yeah	2754	B
oh okay	2754	B
in that case maybe you know	2754	B
right	2754	B
that's true yeah well it it you know you get certain circumstances where you hear about these people that have you know stolen kids and	2754	B
you know done terrible things to them and killed them and you know that sort of thing	2754	B
you just like i don't want that person sharing the Earth with me you know i mean that is just terrible	2754	B
and uh you know we had a case like that here and on the other hand you know people are saying that because the	2754	B
he knows because the the criminals know that the uh penalties can be very severe they uh there's less criminals that are you know turning themselves in or you know	2754	B
pleading or whatever	2754	B
because they know that the judge you know if they find them guilty is you know has the the opportunity to sentence them you know for for the death sentence	2754	B
yeah well i'm just saying that that that's what the the client lawyers are saying they're saying that you know you know more of my clients would have pleaded guilty if they would have gotten a light sentence instead of possibly having to	2754	B
to to get a death sentence because you can't plea bargain what the sentence is going to be you can plea bargain what you're guilty of but	2754	B
you know	2754	B
but not how they're going to sentence it	2754	B
right uh-huh	2754	B
yeah right	2754	B
uh-huh i was just saying that way what they're saying is that they can't get people to turn themselves in then	2754	B
and so we have to go through a trial then to prove the person's guilty and perhaps we can and perhaps we can't and so the guy might get off	2754	B
and uh	2754	B
although usually the guys that are turning themselves in are are guys that are you know going to get caught anyways but	2754	B
there's always a few of those people that are you know lost their head or whatever	2754	B
anyways	2754	B
but uh	2754	B
yeah we just had a terrible case in Virginia where some girl disappeared and and the guy like i said he just uh	2754	B
said that he took her but he won't admit that she died or whatever and he won't say where the body is because he knows the penalty's very severe- severe- you know mandatory life sentences for murder	2754	B
okay	2754	A
yeah	2754	A
uh-huh	2754	A
um i believe in it too	2754	A
uh i'm Catholic and we're not supposed to but uh i feel that it like you you know on the premeditated murders i feel if you're you know i mean if it's beyond a doubt that you did it	2754	A
you know i would say go ahead and execute that person as well	2754	A
but it's the cases you know like sometimes you you know you hear of people that they say they went to jail falsely you know they really didn't do it well you know	2754	A
you you got you got that point well how- you know what what if a mistake is made and you put someone	2754	A
you know to death that really didn't do it	2754	A
there's always that chance i don't know but	2754	A
i would say that you know for that many people to all of them agree that you did it and it was premeditated it would be kind of hard for you know	2754	A
you know what i'm saying like	2754	A
yeah	2754	A
so uh i	2754	A
uh-huh	2754	A
exactly	2754	A
uh i'm not sure about Pennsylvania whether we have it or not for some reason i was thinking that we do but it's you know it's not very often i think maybe last year was the first time in like eighteen years or something like that	2754	A
that anyone	2754	A
anyone from Pennsylvania had gotten it i don't do you know if Virginia has it	2754	A
uh-huh	2754	A
i know Florida has it	2754	A
uh-huh	2754	A
yeah	2754	A
uh you know	2754	A
yeah but it's funny that uh i mean	2754	A
like you know like i said i think last year was the first time in like eighteen years for Pennsylvania i'm not even sure of that but for some reason	2754	A
i think that you know it was something like that and it surprised and even Florida i know they have it and you don't really hear about it real often how many people	2754	A
yeah but you you think that i mean if you think of how many premeditated murders are committed	2754	A
you know compared to that and to how many people are being sent that doesn't seem like very many	2754	A
yeah	2754	A
everyone would appeal	2754	A
that's true too	2754	A
uh-huh	2754	A
uh-huh	2754	A
yeah	2754	A
yeah uh-huh and then they get out	2754	A
yeah they get out in three years on probation and they do it again you know	2754	A
it's like a slap on the fingers for them	2754	A
i don't i don't	2754	A
uh i- i don't i think that it should be i mean if it's beyond a doubt that someone did premeditate someone a murder then i think you know that they should likewise you know someone should take their life also but uh	2754	A
but are are you would you draw the line there with just the premeditated murder	2754	A
yeah	2754	A
uh-huh	2754	A
yeah	2754	A
uh-huh	2754	A
yeah	2754	A
i think some of them would rather be in jail	2754	A
yeah they probably have it better in jail than what they would out in the streets	2754	A
i don't know uh i was just going to say something i forgot what it was	2754	A
oh i don't even remember what it was now	2754	A
in Clarion well i live in Butler but i'm at college- i'm at college i'm at Clarion University	2754	A
yeah	2754	A
uh-huh	2754	A
see yeah okay well see i'm i'm in kind i'm in kind okay uh we only have	2754	A
seven thousand students in the entire campus	2754	A
yeah and that would be pushing it so i mean this is definitely a college town um we're about two hours north of Pittsburgh if that would help you out any um	2754	A
north of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania	2754	A
oh i've never heard of Polk but	2754	A
oh i never heard of that	2754	A
it might have a new name	2754	A
yeah yeah we're probably about an hour away from Sharon	2754	A
uh-huh uh	2754	A
so i most of the kids here i you know like you know just from dorm mates and stuff they'll say that they don't believe in it but then after i would say my point of view then they'll say well yeah you know you know	2754	A
yeah you know i think people can be persuaded one way or another i've never seriously ran into someone i mean like other than my priest you know who definitely says you can't take a you know you can't take anyone's life um	2754	A
anyone that is like so against it that you couldn't persuade them in any instance	2754	A
um-hum	2754	A
exactly yeah uh-huh	2754	A
yeah but you know i look at that and say well they should have thought about that beforehand	2754	A
you know	2754	A
uh-huh	2754	A
uh-huh	2754	A
yeah	2754	A
so i don't think that they deserve anything less	2754	A
it's just i don't i don't know i just	2754	A
uh-huh and that costs money yeah	2754	A
uh-huh	2754	A
yeah	2754	A
okay	2761	A
what are your suggestions in making a family reunion successful	2761	A
well i guess so	2761	A
have you had any in the last- how- well how old are you	2761	A
okay so	2761	A
you have- you have been to some family reunions perhaps	2761	A
now how long in advance do they uh let them know	2761	A
uh-huh	2761	A
so they all know it	2761	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2761	A
yes	2761	A
well that sounds like fun do they all have the small children too that come	2761	A
so all ages	2761	A
well my husband has uh on one side has an extended family	2761	A
and they don't ever plan it like- as like you do i think if you can count on it every four years then	2761	A
people have it in mind so they have to start talking about it or getting their act together about six months ahead to get in touch with everybody because they're rather socially active too	2761	A
and so it has it seems that by doing it about six months ahead they can pretty much get everybody there	2761	A
if they don't you know they'll say oh we're planning to go so and so that go to to a certain place that weekend with somebody else and we're already locked in	2761	A
but six months ahead has seemed to be okay for them	2761	A
my family uh my parents are the youngest of very large families	2761	A
therefore they don't have many people left	2761	A
and uh the few previous ones i've had uh i haven't known many of those people but uh in the last few years it really has just been our immediate family	2761	A
and that's been very nice with uh i have one sister and three brothers	2761	A
and they're only three out of five of us who have children	2761	A
so uh we get to spend a lot of quality time with each other and that's kind of nice because my husband's family reunions are so large	2761	A
and they don't see each other very often we don't really know many of them	2761	A
it really is they're fun they're a lot of fun but uh still uh they're not done on a regular basis	2761	A
and uh you kind of forget what happened and who they were from the time before	2761	A
uh those are the ones that are in Texas	2761	A
or you go to Indiana on that	2761	A
uh-huh where in Indiana	2761	A
Lafayette i don't know where i used to live in Indianapolis	2761	A
yeah yeah it's very pretty country in there i think it's gorgeous	2761	A
well i uh when is your next one uh scheduled now	2761	A
yes well and do you think you'll have a baby to take back with you	2761	A
maybe	2761	A
i mean you need another milestone you know	2761	A
yes well i'm sure and have- then all of your family probably has not met your husband	2761	A
oh is he	2761	A
and and he's living your both living in Sherman	2761	A
do you work to TI uh-huh and does he	2761	A
uh-huh	2761	A
well we don't either but uh i have a friend who uh is working on this project	2761	A
yes and	2761	A
well i don't know uh i- i have a hard time getting uh people on the telephone	2761	A
uh-huh getting through to anybody sometimes i call off and on all day	2761	A
but anyway uh i guess we're supposed to be talking about family reunions aren't we but i got off that	2761	A
yes well um i think we have been talking probably about four and a half minutes	2761	A
and uh uh we both look forward to going to our next reunions i'm sure	2761	A
but it has been fun talking to you	2761	A
thank you	2761	A
okay good bye-bye	2761	A
have a big family i guess that's a start	2761	B
twenty five so i just got married	2761	B
right every four years on one side of my family they plan on having um like my parents- grandparents and all their brothers and sisters and then all their kids and grandkids	2761	B
well we plan on it it's like the third weekend in August so it's every four years and so	2761	B
yeah and then you know arrangements are made like during the Summer for you know	2761	B
um food and whose whose staying where because_1 a lot of people from- are from down here in Texas and uh a lot of my family is in Indiana that's where i'm originally from	2761	B
so um we usually meet like at my uncle's cottage in the um at the lake and uh make a couple days of it	2761	B
yeah pretty much	2761	B
yeah and uh	2761	B
you know there's some my age and then there are some a lot younger an about_1 four generations i guess	2761	B
uh-huh	2761	B
uh-huh	2761	B
uh-huh	2761	B
yeah	2761	B
uh-huh	2761	B
oh	2761	B
yeah	2761	B
uh-huh	2761	B
oh	2761	B
yeah	2761	B
uh-huh	2761	B
yeah that's kind of bad	2761	B
yeah	2761	B
yeah	2761	B
yeah it's it's fun getting together with immediate family a lot of my cousins are real close and we always get together during holidays and weddings and stuff like that so	2761	B
um no the ones in Indiana uh-huh	2761	B
Lafayette	2761	B
yeah it's a little north of Indianapolis about an hour	2761	B
uh-huh	2761	B
so	2761	B
uh-huh well it's like the last one was my high school graduation the next one was when i graduated from college so i guess about two more years	2761	B
uh maybe i don't know two more years i don't know probably	2761	B
yeah i guess that's that's what i mean i've been married now for about nine months so that was another milestone i guess	2761	B
um yeah he's from Indiana so they all met yeah	2761	B
yeah	2761	B
uh-huh	2761	B
no he's trying to get in med school	2761	B
so	2761	B
oh really	2761	B
are they getting all the data they need	2761	B
oh really	2761	B
huh	2761	B
well we've kind of exhausted everything i guess	2761	B
oh okay	2761	B
oh yeah	2761	B
well you too and maybe i'll talk to you again okay bye-bye	2761	B
uh-huh um i think that there is something definitely wrong with our school system just because of the results that you see coming out of the school system as far as uh people dropping out of school uh	2744	A
grades on test scores being low uh more and more people taking GEDs trying to get out of high school instead of just going through high school you know something must be wrong as far as uh maybe-	2744	A
not just the teaching techniques but just motivation	2744	A
within within the schools themselves	2744	A
um-hum	2744	A
oh it's okay	2744	A
um-hum	2744	A
um-hum	2744	A
yeah	2744	A
uh-huh	2744	A
right and i know uh i work around you know a lot of teachers and i understand- i understand how uh	2744	A
supportive they are of their students and how excited they are but some how i don't think the students are getting excited	2744	A
oh yes definitely um-hum	2744	A
um-hum	2744	A
right	2744	A
right	2744	A
uh-huh	2744	A
progress um-hum	2744	A
yeah not not even that much probably yeah	2744	A
um-hum	2744	A
um-hum	2744	A
right	2744	A
um-hum	2744	A
um-hum	2744	A
um-hum	2744	A
and speaking and speaking of doing what you want uh just in society today being that it's nineteen ninety one um a lot of the teenagers and young people	2744	A
have a lot more freedom as far as what they do as far as you know even even something as simple as staying up late	2744	A
um watching television late um going out late start dating you start dating too early you know just little things like that that do start in the home	2744	A
that can that plays a big part because you spend eight hours of your day or more in school	2744	A
and so any other part of your life that's going to definitely affect your school life because you spend so much time there	2744	A
uh-huh	2744	A
right	2744	A
um-hum	2744	A
um-hum	2744	A
um-hum	2744	A
um-hum	2744	A
right	2744	A
i talked to a guy the other day and he is now in in a program that's trying to get him out of high school	2744	A
because he he fell back several years ago and he's going to he he will have gone to school five years	2744	A
um and the reason that he was doing so badly a couple of years ago was because his mother died	2744	A
and he was having to uh support his entire family take care of his brothers and sisters you know and all that had an adverse affect on his school life	2744	A
and yeah and that and that's a perfect example of how your home life you know plays a definite part	2744	A
and you know any other aspect of your life an but now now that he's in this program and you know he's i guess okay he's he's making straight A's	2744	A
and you know it just it it was there it was just	2744	A
i guess school was not a number one priority for him at that time	2744	A
uh-huh	2744	A
um-hum	2744	A
right	2744	A
exactly	2744	A
um-hum	2744	A
exactly-	2744	A
exactly	2744	A
um	2744	A
um-hum	2744	A
um-hum	2744	A
um-hum	2744	A
um-hum	2744	A
right	2744	A
um-hum	2744	A
when people start talking about programs that help for me i don't care if it's socialist or i don't care	2744	A
as long as it's something that's going to do some good or that looks like it could be beneficial i mean that's the point i'm at now	2744	A
i mean that's the point we all should be at if you like finding some solution i mean you know nothing totally radical but if it's something that	2744	A
you know might help you know because there's not a lot being done	2744	A
um-hum um-hum	2744	A
right	2744	A
um-hum	2744	A
take them_1 out yeah	2744	A
hm not very far at all	2744	A
um-hum	2744	A
um-hum i mean it's it's almost like	2744	A
um-hum	2744	A
right right	2744	A
right	2744	A
um-hum	2744	A
and a lot of the	2744	A
a lot of the parents now are so young you know that they're they're still they still don't know what's going on and how are they supposed to	2744	A
you know teach their kids that are coming up you know what's going on i mean it's just it's a vicious cycle	2744	A
that we're you know dead smack dead in the center of and we have to try to swim out you know kind of like the Bermuda Triangle we're just sinking and it's almost impossible to swim back up	2744	A
but um yeah there's definitely problems it's just the solutions that you know they're going to be in our political system they're going to be on everyone's minds for quite a while too long	2744	A
um um-hum	2744	A
um-hum	2744	A
right	2744	A
um-hum	2744	A
um um-hum	2744	A
um-hum um-hum	2744	A
right	2744	A
yeah there's there's	2744	A
right	2744	A
there's definitely too much leeway as far as i mean i've only been out of i've been out of college only two years and	2744	A
you were saying that you don't appreciate education until you get out and i i already you know i really didn't i really don't see myself going back to school or anything but i appreciate more what i had	2744	A
and i had all these classes and all this knowledge and this big library across the street from my dorm and i just didn't take as much advantage of it as i should have and	2744	A
no i went to UT at Austin uh-huh so i mean all kinds of resources and you know just there	2744	A
and i'd give anything to have that right now in my in my regular life- i mean you you have everything given to you i don't see why	2744	A
people wouldn't want that i don't know i but then if i was young i wouldn't see it but you know now that it's gone i	2744	A
right	2744	A
um-hum	2744	A
um-hum	2744	A
right	2744	A
yeah i did a lot and i experienced a lot and i i feel like i got a good college education but just when i got out i feel like i should have spent more time in the library i should have	2744	A
taken those continuing educations classes or whatever they were you know the informal classes that you don't get credit for you know	2744	A
that sounded like one	2744	B
um-hum	2744	B
yeah	2744	B
yeah	2744	B
yeah	2744	B
excuse me just a minute <b_aside> uh i'm on the other line Karen <e_aside>	2744	B
i'm sorry okay uh she uh	2744	B
uh yeah- yeah- yeah well the results- the results i i hear what you're	2744	B
you're saying about the results	2744	B
and uh uh it's	2744	B
what to do about it i guess is the the big thing i'm i'm in a kind of an interesting situation in that my my wife teaches school here in Plano	2744	B
and i know that uh the results that they get out of the system sometime is- is is certainly not	2744	B
-because- you know up to what the effort they put into it you know i've seen that for years yeah	2744	B
um-hum	2744	B
yeah i've often wondered if it doesn't come back to the the home environment	2744	B
and uh it if uh	2744	B
no matter what they do in the in the classroom if they go home at night and you know it's all totally undone uh	2744	B
the the thing that uh uh that Karen my wife has has run into so often is that you run into a group of kids that are going to succeed	2744	B
no matter what no matter how bad their teachers are no matter what a lousy system they're in or anything else these people somehow manage to uh	2744	B
you know push on through and are successful	2744	B
it's uh unfortunately probably what maybe twenty five or thirty percent of them_1 do that	2744	B
well yeah- that would be that'd be at the absolute most and uh	2744	B
you know those- those that you know come out you know fall out of the system that are	2744	B
are real trouble i i wonder whether that's just a uh	2744	B
uh a part of the system you know if you know in a democracy where you know people have kind of uh a freedom to sort of do what they want you know there's- there's an inefficiency there	2744	B
and you've got to let those you know those you- you-	2744	B
um-hum	2744	B
oh	2744	B
oh yeah	2744	B
um-hum	2744	B
um-hum	2744	B
yeah	2744	B
yeah	2744	B
yeah	2744	B
and sometimes in some systems they make everything so competitive you know you from the minute that you walk in until you	2744	B
until you leave you're you're competing against somebody else or you're competing against uh a system or or something you know and then	2744	B
a lot of there- there is a personality type i believe that is really non competitive they're cooperative rather than competitive	2744	B
and when they get into a real competitive system they just say oh well what the heck and uh	2744	B
tend not to	2744	B
you know do too awful well	2744	B
um-hum	2744	B
yeah	2744	B
um-hum	2744	B
um-hum	2744	B
i would think so yeah	2744	B
yeah	2744	B
yeah	2744	B
you know education's wasted on the youth anyway you don't you don't really appreciate it until you're much older anyway i know when i went to school	2744	B
uh my attitude was kind of one of you know these people are you know taking a tremendous amount of my time you know and i've got better things to be doing than sitting here listening to this stuff over and over again	2744	B
i guess today that would be uh somehow or rather there would be a program of some sort that would take care of that sort of thing but	2744	B
the uh the cures- some of the cures that i've heard for this that that sort of make sense uh	2744	B
most teachers after they've taught for a very long especially at the the lower grades can spot a problem almost immediately	2744	B
and uh it's kind of these intervention programs now a lot of people will get to looking at these and say hey that's socialism and that's communism and that's you know and then it gets political	2744	B
but uh boy yeah	2744	B
um-hum	2744	B
yeah	2744	B
um yeah	2744	B
well you know the the radical programs in some cases are just totally unacceptable there are kids families that should just simply be taken out of the homes	2744	B
you know and uh uh	2744	B
you know uh just removed from those situations or they're never going to get anywhere but yet politically that is not a very popular	2744	B
view i'm sure that if you you know ran on a platform of you know we're going to find the kids that are having trouble at home and we're going to take them_1 out of the home and all yeah you know how far you're going to get with that	2744	B
uh but unfortunately it's it's something like that in lieu of that you know is the intervention programs in school where the these kids are are spotted	2744	B
fairly early on and uh you know there's	2744	B
well that's get to be a problem in Texas you know because different school systems have got more- more or less money to take care of that sort of thing you've got counselors and	2744	B
all that but you know you can counsel a kid eight hours a day and then he goes home and	2744	B
and uh uh you know in the in worst cases he's got parents either on drugs or	2744	B
or something like that or they don't care you know mamma what- guess what i did in school today well who cares you know	2744	B
true	2744	B
um-hum	2744	B
yeah	2744	B
yeah	2744	B
yeah i'm	2744	B
um	2744	B
i don't know if you've ever had too much to do with uh	2744	B
oh especially Asian Japanese families coming here in Plano we've got uh quite a few	2744	B
uh engineering types people who have come from Japan and they put their kids in the US schools and they're appalled	2744	B
you know not so much at what the schools are teaching but what they let the kids get away with you know they they see most	2744	B
uh they're they're quite upset about the uh the disruptive	2744	B
influence of school most of them_1 would say you know those people should be removed from the school system and in Japan they would be you know	2744	B
but uh here again you get back into a political thing where uh	2744	B
um-hum	2744	B
um-hum	2744	B
um-hum	2744	B
yeah were you at Baylor	2744	B
yeah did- you go to Baylor	2744	B
oh oh okay i'm uh	2744	B
yeah	2744	B
um-hum well that's- that's it you don't- you you don't have uh you don't have the view	2744	B
i graduated from Texas Tech more than two years ago i guarantee and you know i kind of look back at it sometimes well that was a lot of fun but well- you know i'm not sure that	2744	B
that i took the greatest advantage of you know what i went through there	2744	B
um-hum	2744	B
um-hum	2744	B
yeah	2744	B
uh yeah they've sort of left a bad taste in my mouth too i've been sort of	2764	A
irresponsible a couple of years ago and i'm still paying for the the my own stupidity	2764	A
uh-huh	2764	A
oh you're	2764	A
uh-huh	2764	A
if the other person doesn't	2764	A
yeah	2764	A
oh i'd i'd say so and isn't it now on those those cards was it	2764	A
um	2764	A
mostly her that that ran up the bills yeah	2764	A
twenty thousand	2764	A
wholly smokes	2764	A
yeah that's got to be like	2764	A
close to	2764	A
what a thousand bucks a month	2764	A
uh-huh	2764	A
right	2764	A
yeah you might be worth your while to	2764	A
run one of them	2764	A
thirty dollar uh	2764	A
credit checks just to	2764	A
find out what it says	2764	A
yeah	2764	A
i need to find i need my credit card mostly for uh just government travel you know um	2764	A
uh program manager for the Air Force and uh	2764	A
i uh i have to go on	2764	A
uh travel quite a bit to contractors facilities and when i do i have to have the hotel and all that kind of stuff but i've been trying to	2764	A
curtail my use of it to to nothing except- with the exception of uh	2764	A
of them those type things	2764	A
yeah	2764	A
no i'm not	2764	A
uh-huh	2764	A
yeah	2764	A
oh gee	2764	A
right	2764	A
sounds like it so the the credit card was inactive	2764	A
when you	2764	A
right	2764	A
right	2764	A
oh my gosh	2764	A
yeah	2764	A
guess the the bottom line is uh	2764	A
you got to be	2764	A
darn sure you're marrying the right person when you	2764	A
when you do that too but uh	2764	A
i guess a divorce in any	2764	A
circumstance doesn't normally they're	2764	A
sir	2764	A
yeah	2764	A
that's for sure i know i happen to know of a different guy who um a girl i used to date her brother and- his- his wife ran up	2764	A
thousands of dollars in credit well i guess they're they are both responsible for the stupid things but um	2764	A
had a similar situation and then	2764	A
it was almost like he couldn't get a divorce	2764	A
because uh	2764	A
uh i guess she didn't even work or anything and then he would've been	2764	A
strapped with everything	2764	A
i	2764	A
i remember	2764	A
uh-huh	2764	A
yeah	2764	A
well	2764	A
i know i'm	2764	A
about uh	2764	A
thinking about doing a getting a consolidation loan just to	2764	A
lump everything together so that and it's down to one payment and then just get rid of all these old accounts and just work on a cash only	2764	A
system because uh i'm just i am very- sort of irked at this	2764	A
at these credit card companies and	2764	A
you know they got you	2764	A
and	2764	A
right	2764	A
no no	2764	A
right	2764	A
right	2764	A
yeah	2764	A
yeah i remember uh	2764	A
was it two years ago or they did away with it last year right	2764	A
yeah	2764	A
uh-huh	2764	A
yeah	2764	A
well remember my	2764	A
refund on my income tax was a lot bigger	2764	A
uh two years ago than it was this year	2764	A
that's for sure	2764	A
right	2764	A
right	2764	A
i	2764	A
i can't even declare that here because- uh in my situation because it's uh	2764	A
uh	2764	A
not until i sell it	2764	A
the way- the way it works for me because i own it as	2764	A
jointly with my father	2764	A
and uh	2764	A
the	2764	A
they've changed those or it's a ends up getting classified as a rental property and it's not	2764	A
classified as a regular family dwelling so there's some reason we can't	2764	A
declare any mortgage interest	2764	A
um do you mean do we do i live in it or	2764	A
what	2764	A
what does that mean	2764	A
oh oh and	2764	A
well that would be an interesting situation because i'm a resident of Pennsylvania and uh because i'm in the Air Force and um i'm living here in New York so i can- i can't even vote here	2764	A
a property owner but i can't vote	2764	A
so	2764	A
yeah	2764	A
well that's only fair because the reason i'm a	2764	A
resident- resident of Pennsylvania is because they don't charge military income tax	2764	A
so and so it's like Texas Texas doesn't either	2764	A
uh	2764	A
yeah or	2764	A
yeah	2764	A
uh-huh	2764	A
right	2764	A
huh	2764	A
sure	2764	A
well	2764	A
i don't know	2764	A
just	2764	A
getting back to the subject of credit cards i think the best uh	2764	A
thing	2764	A
maybe is that even though the American Express charges the annual fee is the American Express card is it makes you pay it every month	2764	A
yeah	2764	A
yeah i've got a Diner's Club through the government as well yeah they	2764	A
they force us to have yeah	2764	A
uh government Diner's Club and i had an American Express of my own i probably if i was smart i'd get rid of the American Express and get	2764	A
stop paying that annual fee on it but	2764	A
ooh	2764	A
yeah	2764	A
that that's not good	2764	A
yeah oh jeez	2764	A
really	2764	A
no	2764	A
right	2764	A
yeah it's like going oh i'll have that money by the end of the month and then end of the month comes around and you get your insurance bill comes and	2764	A
few other things and then you're like oh jeez	2764	A
yeah i know that feeling	2764	A
yeah oh well i'm getting to just about to that point myself so	2764	A
yeah really they've been	2764	A
oh really i haven't i- i we've actually haven't timed any of them i just kind of go into conversation	2764	A
ends on it's own or uh or that uh that they do come in with that so well anyway it was nice	2764	A
yeah it's nice talking to you Jerry and uh	2764	A
okay credit cards they leave a bad taste in my mouth	2764	B
yeah	2764	B
yeah	2764	B
well the thing i hate about them i went through a divorce	2764	B
and i will never own another joint credit card	2764	B
because uh even if in the divorce decree one is agrees to pay it	2764	B
if you're a cosigner on it they'll still come after you	2764	B
if the other person doesn't	2764	B
and boy that that's that's a rotten deal	2764	B
yeah	2764	B
yeah	2764	B
about twenty thousand dollars worth	2764	B
i can't imagine any- anybody letting somebody charge that much on a credit card	2764	B
but uh they call me i sent them a copy of the divorce decree and told them i refuse to pay it	2764	B
and	2764	B
yeah	2764	B
and they said well i'm sorry even though the card is in her name you you're a cosigner on it	2764	B
and i i threatened you know legal action and everything i i don't know i've sent them a letter and i said i want this removed from from my credit	2764	B
rating and uh haven't heard anything back but i haven't run a credit check either	2764	B
yeah	2764	B
yeah	2764	B
but uh	2764	B
that's uh i'll never own another joint	2764	B
credit card	2764	B
yeah	2764	B
yeah	2764	B
and i also found out something else uh for your information and i don't know if you're married or not	2764	B
but uh one of the credit cards the uh the account was paid off	2764	B
oh it was paid off for a couple of years never even used it	2764	B
and then all of a sudden i got a phone call from them saying uh uh she's behind in her payments and i said well i don't care she's my ex-wife	2764	B
and uh they said well your name is still on file as cosigner	2764	B
so even dormant	2764	B
credit cards you have	2764	B
uh you you have to go and send them a copy and tell them you're not responsible for any bills	2764	B
but uh it it can turn into a mess	2764	B
yeah it was inactive and i never sent them a copy of the divorce decree or anything because they wasn't even mentioned in the divorce decree as to which party would pay what- what	2764	B
because the the	2764	B
credit card was zero it was you know don't and it was dormant	2764	B
that's right	2764	B
yeah	2764	B
either that or make or each each party have their own own uh credit card not a joint	2764	B
yeah	2764	B
yeah	2764	B
yeah he would have been stuck with everything	2764	B
yeah	2764	B
about the only credit cards i have now are are gas cards	2764	B
but they're in my name only	2764	B
yeah	2764	B
little yeah	2764	B
yeah and uh you'll get letters in the mail where they want to increase your credit line	2764	B
and uh	2764	B
and it also makes it bad because you can't deduct that interest now	2764	B
you know at least you used to get some relief by being able to deduct deduct all that interest and finance charges	2764	B
can't even do that anymore	2764	B
yeah	2764	B
well you uh this last year was ten percent	2764	B
this next time it's zero	2764	B
yeah	2764	B
yeah about only- the only interest you can deduct now are is a house payment mortgage interest and uh	2764	B
and taxes	2764	B
but uh	2764	B
credit cards you can	2764	B
uh-huh	2764	B
yeah	2764	B
right	2764	B
right	2764	B
do you do you or your father either one have it homesteaded	2764	B
no no homesteaded	2764	B
uh in Texas	2764	B
uh you get a uh	2764	B
a big tax break if you- if you	2764	B
call what they homestead it you have to sign a piece of paper that says this is my primary residence and and i live here	2764	B
oh	2764	B
yeah	2764	B
huh	2764	B
yeah	2764	B
that's crazy	2764	B
oh that's so	2764	B
yeah	2764	B
at least now	2764	B
they're they're talking	2764	B
about instituting a uh state income tax	2764	B
everything else that that would bring in money the	2764	B
uh the the people want it but the uh the congress- or Texas	2764	B
State Congress and so forth won't pass a bill to do it like a uh lottery	2764	B
they've been trying to get a lottery- i think the last poll they had here	2764	B
seventy percent of the population voted wanted a lottery	2764	B
and yet the uh the House voted it down the Texas House voted it down	2764	B
they all they want to do is increase property taxes and	2764	B
put a income tax in	2764	B
it makes you	2764	B
right it makes you pay it	2764	B
i i do have an American Express but i got it through uh TI	2764	B
it's a it's a yeah it's a	2764	B
yeah it's a corporate	2764	B
uh	2764	B
yeah	2764	B
yeah and if you're late on this on my American Express they write TI	2764	B
since it's a corporate corporate American Express	2764	B
and if you don't pay it you get a call from your supervisor saying why hasn't this been paid	2764	B
so you don't dare run up anything on it that you can't you know that you can't pay that's that's the problem with credit cards it it's	2764	B
people don't think of it as cash	2764	B
they think of it like uh monopoly money that hey i can just charge this and	2764	B
pay it wherever i feel like it	2764	B
yeah	2764	B
right	2764	B
yeah	2764	B
huh	2764	B
so i guess the the secret's not to have credit cards	2764	B
well i guess we've been i'm surprised they hadn't beeped in and said your ten minutes is up	2764	B
they've been uh even before ten minutes here lately they've been saying	2764	B
you should cut it off	2764	B
well listen i've enjoyed talking with you	2764	B
okay Kate uh do you play golf	2737	A
uh-huh	2737	A
yeah yeah	2737	A
right	2737	A
that's very similar to me	2737	A
i just uh haven't taken the time to learn the fundamentals of the game i just go out and try to be Joe Athlete and think that i can just	2737	A
you know use transfer skills from like you said softball or baseball	2737	A
and i've got that baseball swing and i hook everything viciously so i have to aim like forty five degrees off to the to the right and hopefully it curves back in and usually i end up uh	2737	A
going from one side of the fairway to the other and not straight down the middle	2737	A
yeah	2737	A
uh-huh	2737	A
yeah	2737	A
uh-huh yeah	2737	A
do you watch golf on TV a lot	2737	A
uh-huh	2737	A
yeah	2737	A
uh-huh	2737	A
oh yeah yeah i we don't have a TV so we don't watch much golf	2737	A
yeah so we don't go out to the local uh uh golf course and watch amateurs very often so uh uh but you know when i was younger when i was into it i'd watch it	2737	A
every now and then if if baseball or basketball or something else wasn't on and golf was always the uh	2737	A
the if nothing else is on i'll watch golf	2737	A
because i don't know it's it's pretty it's neat watching i really enjoy watching the highlights like on ESPN Sports Center when they show the great shots and everything i mean that's fun but i don't i'm not up for watching the whole game like i do for baseball or basketball	2737	A
yeah	2737	A
huh	2737	A
yeah so you've been in the gallery before	2737	A
so who'd you follow	2737	A
yeah	2737	A
was it like a big name with a big gallery or was it one of the younger pros or something	2737	A
yeah	2737	A
yeah well yeah you're outdoors and you know it's kind of neat that's the only thing that's what draws me to golf is just you know being outside on a large wide open space pretty much	2737	A
and uh well down here it's so expensive i'm from Indiana and up there	2737	A
i i went to Purdue and you have Purdue golf course and if you're a student i mean you can play eighteen holes for like seven bucks	2737	A
on a really you know it's a big ten championship course so it's really well kept and everything else but you know down here it's it's incredible i've	2737	A
i've never golfed down here because it's you know nine holes for ten bucks or something and	2737	A
and by the time i i drill a you know a half dozen balls into a pond or something you know that's that's an extra five bucks right there and so	2737	A
you know it gets kind of expensive for the young college graduate	2737	A
uh-huh	2737	A
yeah	2737	A
golf clock	2737	A
has a subscription to Golf Magazine or something	2737	A
that's funny	2737	A
yeah so uh has he always been like that or just in the later years	2737	A
yeah	2737	A
yeah	2737	A
um-hum	2737	A
well if nothing else just get out there and rub shoulders with the boys	2737	A
yeah	2737	A
well that's neat	2737	A
so uh you don't see you uh	2737	A
taking up you know and charging being the avid golfer in the near future huh	2737	A
oh volleyball	2737	A
yeah	2737	A
i've never really well Sherman's a smaller plant but i've never really seen	2737	A
a golf club but okay i've seen a golf club that's funny but uh golfing club uh	2737	A
uh-huh	2737	A
yeah	2737	A
well i don't- know there just not that many places to play around here from what i hear there's a private club maybe one and there's uh there's uh	2737	A
the local junior college has a golf course because it used to be an Air Force base so they've got the old Air Force base golf course and it's like	2737	A
playing on dirt i mean there's no grass so uh you know it's not too many golfers like there are in Dallas probably	2737	A
with more courses and more people and probably higher money better kept	2737	A
but	2737	A
i don't know i'm i'm just kind of glad my wife's kind of in to it she's she'll play in it about once or twice a year but that's about it	2737	A
well if it's genetic you'd better be careful	2737	A
likewise and uh maybe we'll get hooked up again sometime all right take care bye	2737	A
um i have played golf in the past i'm not very good at it even though i'm pretty well sports minded um there's something about holding that club in my hand that i want to hold it like a baseball bat	2737	B
so i can putt but i have a terrible time driving	2737	B
uh-hum	2737	B
uh-huh	2737	B
uh-huh	2737	B
sure	2737	B
um-hum	2737	B
uh-huh	2737	B
yeah yeah like you're supposed to well i even uh took a golf lesson	2737	B
six weeks i guess worth of golf lessons and and i had a terrible time trying to remember uh where your hands are supposed to be and over this way and under that way and keep your legs this way and it was	2737	B
extremely difficult considering how easy it looks when the pros do it and so uh i played for a while that way but i can go play Putt Putt Golf really well that's the kind of that's the kind of stuff i can go for	2737	B
um i watch some of the things because my father is an avid golf fan he he watches every game he goes out every single day his whole stance	2737	B
the way he walks is a golfer's walk if there is such a thing and so he uh he's gotten me interested in it	2737	B
so i have my own putters and and you know some some equipment but um the only thing that i would probably watch is like things that are local like the Byron Nelson Classic that's coming up	2737	B
um and then there's another one out let me see off of one twenty one coming up pretty soon so i like to watch things that are close uh by to see if there's any names that are familiar with Texas	2737	B
uh-huh no i can't imagine watching much golf without a TV	2737	B
um-hum um-hum	2737	B
um-hum	2737	B
yeah	2737	B
yes yes um-hum	2737	B
right right yeah well at least with now with the with the sports uh and and the TV is um they can get the camera's	2737	B
just at the time the people are starting to swing so it makes it a little bit faster and um a little bit more interesting but i think it's it's more interesting to go out and watch them	2737	B
uh than it is on the TV and and to follow like one or two people along on the golf course and then you you almost feel like you are	2737	B
in doing exactly what they are doing uh it it's so much more interesting i thought than um uh sitting and watching it on TV i think it's kind of boring yeah	2737	B
um-hum uh on the Byron Nelson Classics um was it no it wasn't last year it was the year before	2737	B
uh gosh i can't even remember you know all those names kind of go together after a while	2737	B
um let me see because i followed several	2737	B
and i'm trying to think who it is that i was um going along with i don't remember now	2737	B
uh watching than it was to watch it on TV	2737	B
um-hum	2737	B
um-hum um-hum	2737	B
um-hum	2737	B
oh wow	2737	B
um-hum	2737	B
um-hum	2737	B
yeah	2737	B
sure sure well i know uh	2737	B
uh since it's warmer weather down here and you can	2737	B
play almost year round then yeah that's the reason is there's so many people who want to get out and go play golf	2737	B
see my parents live in Ohio and my dad what he'll do is uh he will come down here or go someplace else in the South to where it's warm so he can continue playing golf i mean this is what an avid golf person does	2737	B
it is just so fascinating and then everything we get for him is all golf junk you know the golf hat the golf you know clock everything because_1 he's he's just he is he is a freak when it comes to golfing	2737	B
yeah he uh he's he's really something	2737	B
no see he um it's only been in about the past five years	2737	B
and he's so good we keep telling him he needs to get into some of those senior tournaments and he says oh i can't get in there with Arnold Palmer and all those other good people	2737	B
but i'm saying yes you could you know and then that's where you usually can make a little money and and profit this way uh because his handicap has gotten lower and lower and lower every single year	2737	B
so uh but no he hasn't gone to do that yet but we wish he would you know make a little mega bucks and pass it along you know to the family	2737	B
that's right i know get to meet all these stars because i remember sitting on his lap when i was a little girl watching golf he has loved golf really all of his life and but i remember watching it golf with him	2737	B
so yeah this is something that uh he can go and see all these people he's uh got to watch on TV for years and years and years and years so	2737	B
yeah i think so too	2737	B
no i think some of my brothers are going to do that i'm a volleyball person myself yeah yeah i love volleyball so i'm on a TI league	2737	B
and uh play with a group of people from here at work but i don't even think TI has well they may have a golfing	2737	B
i don't know they may have a golfing club you know it's possible	2737	B
um-hum	2737	B
golfing club yeah there you go i bet you they do but i just	2737	B
you know i hear about things like the tennis- the tennis um teams and uh volleyball and baseball but i haven't heard of golf but i'm sure they probably do	2737	B
uh-huh	2737	B
oh	2737	B
oh no uh-huh	2737	B
uh um-hum	2737	B
uh-huh	2737	B
yeah yeah yeah me too it's not uh not something like uh that obsession i think my father has	2737	B
i know that's true well it was nice talking with you	2737	B
okay	2737	B
okay take care bye-bye	2737	B
yes	2710	A
um-hum	2710	A
right	2710	A
you have a lot of discipline they make it really easy for people to uh to get credit cards especially college students	2710	A
i have uh two daughters who who both are in college or in fact one has finished now but they both have a lot of credit cards	2710	A
and	2710	A
uh-huh	2710	A
uh right	2710	A
and then they they give you uh uh the credit limit and then you're always seemingly- seemingly up to that limit now i have quite a few credit cards that i'm always almost up to the limit on most of them_1	2710	A
and that's that's how a lot of people get into trouble	2710	A
um-hum	2710	A
right	2710	A
yeah	2710	A
yeah well you have a lot of discipline i uh	2710	A
i'm trying my best right now to pay off some of mine i i've paid off about four credit cards this year and uh	2710	A
but still i have some that are are up to the limit and especially the Visa card that you can go and get cash on it seems like every time i'm short of cash i just go get get it from Visa	2710	A
uh-huh	2710	A
uh	2710	A
it well uh you can go in a bank and just hand them the Visa Card and say i want a cash advance	2710	A
or if they've sent you a uh a number that you can use you know a a personal identification number that you can use in the uh Impact machines or whatever you you can do that	2710	A
because_1 i have one that i don't have a pin number for	2710	A
you know sometimes you have to ask them for that	2710	A
and then i have one that uh just gave me the pin number automatically	2710	A
um-hum	2710	A
right	2710	A
oh wow	2710	A
well they they do that a lot if you have good credit and you have been paying your bills on time everybody in the world will offer you a a credit card	2710	A
um-hum	2710	A
um-hum	2710	A
right well you know the way the economy's going and inflation and the recession and all that i think we we really need to try to stay out of debt as much as possible that's	2710	A
that's why i've i've really started to try to to pay off mine and get out of debt because	2710	A
we never know when we might you know get laid off or something especially me i work for Texas Instruments and they've had had a lot of of uh you know layoffs lately	2710	A
you do	2710	A
where are you	2710	A
Johnson City uh-huh i know they're selling out somebody in Colorado Springs	2710	A
yeah	2710	A
it it certainly is	2710	A
i've um	2710	A
i have worked on a part part time job um	2710	A
where i was a collector for um	2710	A
uh uh a jewelry company	2710	A
people um	2710	A
that they just had this jewelry account it was Zales Jewelry in fact and uh	2710	A
a whole bunch of people- i mean they have	2710	A
about a thousand collectors i guess	2710	A
and uh	2710	A
there's just so many people that have bought jewelry which is really a luxury item and then they they just can't pay for it something something happens you know you hear so many stories listening to them like	2710	A
uh you know they lost their job or uh they they've signed for a friend	2710	A
you know they got it in their name but they got it for a friend and then the friend wouldn't pay them_1 and now they're stuck with the bill and it's ruining their credit and	2710	A
you really have to watch it this you know because_1 yeah because every every month all of these credit cards report to the credit bureau you know automatically most- most of them_1 do	2710	A
yeah and if you if you're uh	2710	A
it's bad because if you you know your bill is due on the fifteenth then you're you're not past due until the fifteenth of the next month but	2710	A
you know if you if you pay one day after that fifteenth you're not one day late you're thirty days late	2710	A
right	2710	A
right and anyway we need to watch our credit reports and all that kind of	2710	A
um-hum well you know you you can do that i believe it costs about ten dollars	2710	A
oh yeah it is it is you might even find somebody's been reporting on you and you didn't even know it you know you i mean you might think you're paying something on time or	2710	A
and you by that day and you're thirty- thirty days is not real bad though anyway	2710	A
if you've got a charge off on your credit report- report or something like that that's when it really gets bad or something you haven't paid in sixty days or ninety days you know	2710	A
things like that	2710	A
um-hum	2710	A
do they charge a lot of interest on that card i don't	2710	A
uh-huh	2710	A
um-hum	2710	A
yeah	2710	A
well always watch out for somebody- anybody who bills you out of Atlanta Georgia or there's a couple of other places that are able to charge us like twenty one and twenty two percent interest	2710	A
i know i had a charge with uh Spiegel	2710	A
and i hadn't read the uh terms of the credit agreement really and uh when i did i you know i realized that that it just looked seemed like i was never paying the balance	2710	A
off you know and i looked at the credit card agreement one day	2710	A
and it was like twenty three percent interest	2710	A
and that's the one bill that i hurry up hurried and paid up and and i've always watched it since then you really have to watch those interest rates	2710	A
that's true so anyway they can't bill you any higher than eighteen percent i think in in Texas but there there are a couple of states that can	2710	A
and one to watch out for is anybody that bills you out of Atlanta Atlanta Georgia	2710	A
well	2710	A
um-hum	2710	A
um-hum	2710	A
um-hum	2710	A
ooh	2710	A
wow	2710	A
i wonder if they	2710	A
i started when i was in college you know they always offer credit cards for college students	2710	B
so i went ahead and and accepted every one that i was offered because i knew it would be easier to go ahead and get them and establish credit early	2710	B
so i pack- i pack around a lot of them but i only use a few of them	2710	B
yeah	2710	B
and they give you such high credit limits it's it's easy to get caught up	2710	B
in the minimum payment trap	2710	B
yeah i've got i've got two that i you know that usually i'll have a a balance on	2710	B
and then all of the others i just try to use kind of like you would an American Express card and and pay it off every month that way i feel like i'm getting you know a thirty day loan	2710	B
but i don't have to worry about you know running them up too high except at Christmas then they usually go then they usually get run up pretty good	2710	B
uh-huh	2710	B
yeah	2710	B
now that's one that's i've never used my Visa for cash before	2710	B
can you use it like at a bank machine or	2710	B
yeah	2710	B
oh okay	2710	B
yeah	2710	B
now we got that's that's funny you said that because we got a credit card um my husband and i got credit cards in the mail one day that we hadn't even applied for	2710	B
then a couple of weeks later we got we got pin numbers	2710	B
and then we got a a bill saying you know uh the yearly fee it was like forty dollars and we we cut them_1 up and sent them back because we we hadn't even applied for them and we didn't want them	2710	B
but they they had just automatically approved us and sent them without even contacting us	2710	B
so i thought man i don't know if i trust this or not	2710	B
it's like let's see if we can get her to run up her bills	2710	B
but it's hard i mean it's it's tempting when you see something to say well i'll just charge it	2710	B
and sometimes i'll do that but usually i- i will try to pay everything off the next month or the ones that that usually have an outstanding balance all the time i'll i'll pay more than the minimum payment	2710	B
just i feel- i feel like even that little bit helps	2710	B
i know it	2710	B
well i work for TI too	2710	B
and i think they're getting ready to to probably sell us out our division	2710	B
in Johnson City Tennessee	2710	B
yeah	2710	B
yeah they just they just announced that didn't they	2710	B
so i mean it's it's kind of a bad time to be a slave to your credit cards	2710	B
uh-huh	2710	B
man	2710	B
yeah	2710	B
ooh	2710	B
didn't pay them	2710	B
man	2710	B
that's scary	2710	B
i didn't realize that	2710	B
yeah	2710	B
oh okay	2710	B
they don't they don't recognize any time difference do they	2710	B
ooh that's scary	2710	B
that's something i never thought about getting you know checking with to see what what your credit report looked like	2710	B
might be worth it for peace of mind	2710	B
yeah	2710	B
really	2710	B
i think that Discover card has a good idea with you know giving you a little cash back incentive for each amount you you purchase as long as you don't go crazy trying to get cash back	2710	B
and since they don't have the yearly fee	2710	B
i don't know i've never i haven't gotten one just because it's i- i felt like with Visa and MasterCard and American Express you didn't need another one	2710	B
i would think it wouldn't be you know much more than the eighteen or nineteen percent everyone else charges	2710	B
so that that wouldn't be too bad	2710	B
yeah	2710	B
holy cow	2710	B
definitely that's awful	2710	B
i mean there's no point in giving them any more money than we have to so	2710	B
well that's great	2710	B
i'll try to remember that one	2710	B
oh	2710	B
well	2710	B
see i was trying to think if there was anything else	2710	B
um	2710	B
so i guess the worst problem i ever had with with a credit card though was um i got a an item on my bill that i had never purchased	2710	B
i had ordered a sofa and had filled out the paperwork but they weren't supposed to process it until they delivered it and i changed my mind but then they went ahead and charged it on my account	2710	B
and it took me about eighteen months	2710	B
to get that all of that mess off of my account	2710	B
so that's that's probably the worst thing i've ever had happen with a credit card	2710	B
well	2735	B
i think we have a lot of laws on the books right now that if they were	2735	B
kept and followed would take care of a lot of the problems we have	2735	B
pardon	2735	B
yes	2735	B
the gun the gun control	2735	B
uh-huh	2735	B
right	2735	B
uh-huh	2735	B
we require permits like if you're going to carry a pistol for protection or for whatever reason you you know have you to have a permit for that	2735	B
uh-huh	2735	B
uh-huh	2735	B
uh-huh	2735	B
i- i just i just don't feel that uh a stronger restrictions is going to stop a person who really wants to have one for misuse	2735	B
i really don't personally feel that it's going to help	2735	B
well those we don't need	2735	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2735	B
uh-huh	2735	B
no no no	2735	B
somebody's who's into into shooting though like you say sharpshooters or uh that type of thing wouldn't be so bad but uh	2735	B
uh-huh	2735	B
uh-huh	2735	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2735	B
i don't think the laws	2735	B
are going to keep them from getting them if they really want one	2735	B
i just i really don't believe that	2735	B
uh-huh	2735	B
oh definitely definitely	2735	B
uh-huh that's i say if they would use the laws they have on the books	2735	B
i think it would stop quite a bit of what goes on	2735	B
but they're i don't know it it sometimes seems like they're too lenient with some things but yet if a guy steals a loaf of bread for their family	2735	B
he's in worse trouble than they are	2735	B
yeah	2735	B
um-hum	2735	B
uh-huh	2735	B
uh-huh	2735	B
uh-huh	2735	B
uh-huh	2735	B
yeah	2735	B
yeah it's kind of a cop out	2735	B
uh-huh	2735	B
oh you definitely	2735	B
yeah yeah	2735	B
i think a lot of people put themselves in the place- in the place of the person that has done the crime	2735	B
and they think of how they would react and then they don't think anybody could do the things that this person is accused of doing	2735	B
and i think that sometimes colors some of their feelings on uh	2735	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2735	B
right right	2735	B
right right	2735	B
uh-huh	2735	B
they should be kept there and overcrowding of course that has a lot to do with i think a lot of times with uh the type of sentence that's given	2735	B
you know what's available for keeping them	2735	B
what	2735	B
uh-huh	2735	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2735	B
i don't have a my my my husband and my one boy he hunted uh	2735	B
so	2735	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2735	B
um-hum	2735	B
um-hum	2735	B
um-hum um-hum	2735	B
uh-huh	2735	B
well some people have no sense at all in shooting to know how far to be away from buildings and that to shoot i mean	2735	B
some of them use no sense at all	2735	B
uh-huh well we've had that happen in our area also um-hum	2735	B
uh-huh	2735	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2735	B
uh-huh	2735	B
well i think it depends on the community now we're rural also and our houses are not	2735	B
they're not that close like we have a shooting range across the road from our home	2735	B
but it's far enough away we have fields around it	2735	B
and it's	2735	B
it's far enough away from you know houses and	2735	B
that type of thing that uh	2735	B
no it's just our own personal	2735	B
we just have a a personal lot yeah yeah	2735	B
now we do have a sportsman's uh club who has a an indoor shooting range	2735	B
and it's very nice our our one boy was a sharpshooter	2735	B
he was interested yeah he was interested in that then uh	2735	B
did a	2735	B
uh no not really he doesn't do it now because he's not here he lives in Pittsburgh	2735	B
now and so he he really hasn't been doing too much shooting lately	2735	B
but he he really did enjoy it	2735	B
um	2735	B
i don't think they had to have not for shooting not for their rifles and that	2735	B
it would be just like uh going hunting you don't need a permit to carry you know you're not allowed to carry them loaded or anything like that	2735	B
uh	2735	B
no no i don't think so uh the rifles that they use like in their uh	2735	B
uh ROTC	2735	B
now i think they had to they i think they had to do a little bit more when they use them they also had a club at the college here	2735	B
that he shot in and	2735	B
they had a few more restrictions there	2735	B
right right	2735	B
yeah there's no there's really no call for	2735	B
for that that type of weapon	2735	B
uh-huh	2735	B
uh-huh now the lady said they she wanted us to rate from one to ten as to how we felt on a one being uh	2735	B
yeah	2735	B
ten ten would be no regulations at all let's see no wait how was it	2735	B
okay	2735	B
yeah	2735	B
yeah	2735	B
i would go along with that	2735	B
a happy medium so to speak	2735	B
uh-huh	2735	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2735	B
yeah yeah	2735	B
i don't know if we solved it but it is a problem and it unfortunately uh	2735	B
i'm not real crazy about guns myself but being from hunting families i	2735	B
tolerate them	2735	B
and i like i like them to learn their safety rules and that and and i think that is good that they have to have a uh now here at least	2735	B
they have a hunter's safety course that the the young people have to take before they're allowed to hunt yes	2735	B
they they have to do that before they can get a license to hunt	2735	B
um-hum um-hum	2735	B
okay Jean um could you tell me what you what you think about uh gun control	2735	A
as as far as firearms go	2735	A
or as far as firearms going or is it just uh the	2735	A
gun controls yeah i'm not really all that sure on on	2735	A
uh what the federal regulations are but it seems like each state has their own	2735	A
or at at least that's what my belief is is that each state has their own regulations	2735	A
you know some require uh uh a permit	2735	A
and some don't some require waiting periods and some don't um	2735	A
right that's	2735	A
that's what it is up here it's like that too you need uh as far as a rifle or anything like that no you can just go out and buy it um	2735	A
no unless it's a like one of those automatic weapons	2735	A
you know i can see there are uh gun collectors that you know go out and collect all these and there are people that go out and fire on ranges and things	2735	A
um if you want an automatic weapon just for that because you certainly-	2735	A
don't need it going out hunting	2735	A
um then i think	2735	A
yep	2735	A
i yeah i think that should be regulated	2735	A
those types of weapons as far as a pistol	2735	A
anybody and uh	2735	A
and their uncle can get a pistol anytime they want um	2735	A
no no what i	2735	A
what i think should happen is uh any violent crime with a weapon with a with a pistol	2735	A
or or a rifle for that matter	2735	A
i think they should prosecute to the fullest extent of the law	2735	A
and that's that's what they're not doing now	2735	A
right they crucify him	2735	A
um	2735	A
but yeah i don't know if it's i don't know if it's the judicial system like the judges that are too lenient	2735	A
because there are precedents saying you know well it's	2735	A
he really didn't mean to do it it was a fit of anger or or uh he had too much to drink or he was on dope and he didn't know what he was doing	2735	A
uh i don't really buy that i mean	2735	A
if he if he drank too much he knew he drank too much or or if he was on dope he knew he was he was what was going to happen when he when he took it	2735	A
yeah	2735	A
but yet i've seen some	2735	A
jury trials where the people feel sorry for the whoever did whatever they did	2735	A
and they and they're lenient they go lenient on them and then after they sit there and i read the paper and i say she you know	2735	A
um	2735	A
yep yeah	2735	A
you're probably right uh a lot of cases too it is	2735	A
um in a fit of anger people do things that they regret for the rest of their life	2735	A
but yet	2735	A
there are also the others	2735	A
that commit crimes over and over and over again and	2735	A
they're out on the street after a short sentence	2735	A
those are the ones that you know should get the book thrown at them on	2735	A
yeah	2735	A
let's	2735	A
yeah um	2735	A
i grew up in a rural area and we've always uh we've always hunted i've hunted for years until i got older and then i- i just hung my guns up and i just kind of	2735	A
you know i'd rather go out with a camera now and- and shoot the animals	2735	A
yeah well we we passed a or the town passed an ordinance that it's against the law now to to shoot a firearm off in the town and it's it's still a rural area and it's still farms and orchards and	2735	A
and we live	2735	A
right down by next to the reservoir so there's a lot of ducks and you know there's all kinds of wild animals	2735	A
and for years it was like a shooting gallery down there	2735	A
right	2735	A
yep yep because we didn't but a neighbor of ours had uh uh a bullet came came through right right through the side of the house and it	2735	A
so but since they've done that since they've limited hunting	2735	A
it's been uh the birds are back the animals are back it's uh it's peaceful	2735	A
so our town got together	2735	A
so maybe uh communities have to do that if you	2735	A
it's a regular oh but	2735	A
yeah	2735	A
it's a what is it like a rod and gun club	2735	A
oh okay so it's	2735	A
it's for you oh okay	2735	A
oh isn't that good yeah	2735	A
so what is he does he have to follow certain rules and regulations because he's a uh sharpshooter or	2735	A
yep	2735	A
but	2735	A
but he had to have a special permit to carry a gun from place to place	2735	A
oh okay yeah i know	2735	A
right yeah	2735	A
so you just need a hunting license	2735	A
oh okay yep	2735	A
ah okay	2735	A
yeah so he was probably following	2735	A
whatever the protocol was for the military	2735	A
yeah	2735	A
so i kind of agree with you then that uh uh the only the only thing i would like to see them regulate is is the automatic weapons	2735	A
but as far as everything else uh if they	2735	A
if they followed the rules and regulations and the laws that were already in place	2735	A
i think that uh uh	2735	A
that would suffice we wouldn't have to go any further we wouldn't have to put more regulations out there	2735	A
that's right a a total ban	2735	A
on on	2735	A
yeah right ten was no no restrictions whatsoever and one being was uh	2735	A
uh a total ban	2735	A
you know or totally restrictive	2735	A
i kind of think uh	2735	A
probably a six i would go with	2735	A
uh that's	2735	A
yeah i'd like to see them restrict just those like i said before those new automatic weapons but the rest of it i don't think they need anymore	2735	A
okay so i guess we kind of we've solved that problem right	2735	A
yeah yeah well that's	2735	A
have to take before they ah that's good that is	2735	A
yeah and any responsible person or any responsible hunter is going to is going to go through some kind of a a course like that um	2735	A
uh-huh	2768	B
yeah	2768	B
right	2768	B
yeah yeah i agree with you i um a group that i'm a part of goes once a month to a um	2768	B
they call it the Heritage House it's it's a nursing home for elderly people and this particular one has people that are in pretty bad shape a lot of them have had	2768	B
um limbs amputated or um have serious illnesses you know that kind of thing and	2768	B
um i watched the interesting thing was i watched this particular one change hands it started out just being a terrible place for the people and then a new company bought it	2768	B
and came in and remodeled the whole place hired new nurses and uh just really just redid it you know	2768	B
well to me it was dirty for one thing uh when you would walk in the smell was just awful though you know the floors you could just	2768	B
if you're walking on them feel how filthy they were um there were a lot of people just kind of up and down the halls laying in their beds hollering and you know crying and	2768	B
of course i don't know how many of them were you know just not in their right mind or how many were	2768	B
you know yeah yeah i just really don't know but i feel like they were neglected and um	2768	B
right	2768	B
right	2768	B
right i don't really think anyone was being you know cruel or or trying to mistreat them or anything i just think they were	2768	B
just not doing anymore you know than they had to do and um just kind of letting everybody live	2768	B
in a not very good environment	2768	B
but this new company came in and they like i said they remodeled the place and it smells nice when you walk in and it looks nice and	2768	B
they got like several new color TV's for the people and and redid the dining room where they made it you know a lot more interesting place for them to be they made a little patio area where they can go outside and	2768	B
yeah just you know just small things that make it seem a lot more	2768	B
yeah and it's like it's a lot more like an apartment place instead of just uh horrible	2768	B
right	2768	B
right	2768	B
right	2768	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2768	B
right	2768	B
right with nothing you know	2768	B
yeah	2768	B
right	2768	B
right	2768	B
um	2768	B
right	2768	B
yeah	2768	B
well they uh this this place that we visit it's really neat they have everyday they have schedules of groups that come in and	2768	B
they will do bingo our group does a church service once a month and and then other service- other groups come in and do the services you know other Sundays so that they have at least one service every Sunday and	2768	B
so there are a lot of things there are places that have a lot of things for them to do	2768	B
but you really do have to kind of seek it out you know and	2768	B
and make sure that it's not a place like this one was	2768	B
yeah yeah yeah it is it's real nice and um i know our church does it and there are a lot of other churches and they are just like civic organizations that do	2768	B
and uh i have other friends it's kinds of neat they take um animals over and let the people pet them like they also have a dog that maybe needs a home and they will wash it all up and	2768	B
make sure it's a friendly animal you know and take it in and let just let the old elderly people pet the dogs	2768	B
yeah	2768	B
yeah	2768	B
yeah yeah	2768	B
yeah yeah i thought that was a real unusual thing for someone to do so	2768	B
yeah it there's a lot that can be done it's just a matter of people not being lazy	2768	B
and you know doing the best they can but again i don't know what i'd do if it was my own mother or grandmother you know uh that would be	2768	B
right yeah	2768	B
right	2768	B
uh-huh	2768	B
yeah	2768	B
yeah	2768	B
yeah yeah i would too	2768	B
yeah right yeah	2768	B
yeah i know i know what you mean	2768	B
yeah well i have interesting conversations with a lot of these people because um	2768	B
um many of them of course their minds are not good	2768	B
and so a lot of them have told me exactly the same story you know every time i visit them	2768	B
they'll tell me they'll reminisce about childhood and tell me something that they did and then the next time i go it's the same thing you know but	2768	B
just somebody to listen to them uh just seems to really make them_1 feel good	2768	B
right i'll tell you the people i feel the the sorriest for there's a a a guy at this particular one i go to that i think that he's really an intelligent person but he has cerebral palsy so bad that he just cannot communicate	2768	B
and um he's blind and he's um has seizures you know i mean he's just he's like in a world of his own and yet he wants so much to be around people	2768	B
and if you come over to him if he can touch your hand he'll grab it and kiss it and oh he's always got a smile i mean he really tries to	2768	B
to brighten up your life oh it's just amazing um but he can't say anything he can just kind of make noises you know	2768	B
yeah	2768	B
yeah	2768	B
me too	2768	B
yeah uh-huh	2768	B
i know	2768	B
i know	2768	B
i know	2768	B
uh-huh	2768	B
uh-huh	2768	B
um	2768	B
um	2768	B
yeah yeah	2768	B
oh yeah	2768	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2768	B
yeah yeah	2768	B
oh it does yeah	2768	B
yeah yeah it is it's really hard and	2768	B
but the one of the neatest things i think though is we always take our kids i have a three year old and a six year old and they um	2768	B
have gotten comfortable being around these people because they've always gone with us	2768	B
and the people love them and	2768	B
they want the children you know to hug them or hold their hand and so far my kids will do it just real easily	2768	B
and i think it's because they've gone since they were real little and they've never been afraid but um that's something to me children	2768	B
you know need to people need to take groups of children because the kids just brighten up their lives they	2768	B
as we walk through the the lobby they'll all say bring her here i want to see her you know i want to hold her and	2768	B
uh-huh	2768	B
yeah	2768	B
that's true	2768	B
yeah	2768	B
yeah well me too	2768	B
yeah it's quite an experience	2768	B
yeah yeah there are and and uh it really helps those people i think	2768	B
but like you said i'd i'd really have a lot of second thoughts before i put any of my own family members there i	2768	B
would be a last resort	2768	B
oh i know i'm always afraid like oh no what if i lose my mind am i going to end up in a place like that	2768	B
yeah	2768	B
yeah that's right	2768	B
well	2768	B
yeah you too Tonya thanks for calling bye	2768	B
okay um i don't have any i guess definite views about elderly care um	2768	A
the first thing that comes to mind is kind of those horror movies that you see where elderly people are abused and things like that i think that's one thing that i would look at if i was	2768	A
um putting my grandmother or my mother uh	2768	A
in some sort of home the first thing that i would look at would be their history	2768	A
as far as any court cases that came out of there um the history of you know their doctors their nurses and things like that	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
i'm just out of curiosity what what kinds of things were they doing when they were considered a bad place what	2768	A
huh uh-huh	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
uh	2768	A
oh my goodness	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
in pain or something yeah	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
yeah that's what i was going to say it sounds like to just neglect all over neglect you know to clean up and	2768	A
right right	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
huh	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
that's great	2768	A
homely yeah	2768	A
i would i would personally hate to know that my mother or grandmother or	2768	A
anyone is in a home like that and my biggest fear would that they would be is that they would be lonely	2768	A
and i would like to know that there are	2768	A
you know just a lot of activities like you said you know just putting a plant in a room you know Just makes just brightens and and and just makes them just a little more active television	2768	A
they they can go outside and just to know that they're not you know laying in a room looking at gray walls you know that that would	2768	A
that that's what would just really kill me i'd like to know that you know they have friends there and they you know have little conversations and things i'd like to know there's a lot of interaction and	2768	A
maybe some kind of of activity little field trips or something i don't know how they would do that but	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
oh	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
wow	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
uh-huh i didn't realize that there were groups that go in like that that's really neat that's really neat	2768	A
right uh-huh	2768	A
oh	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
that is great for that that will be something you know they would look forward to if they knew that you know that the puppy is coming on Wednesday	2768	A
you know that would be something to look for that's really neat that really is	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
right	2768	A
yeah	2768	A
putting putting any of my family in an elderly	2768	A
home to me would be a very- the very last resort you know it	2768	A
um and i know it's hard for you know a lot of families if you're trying to to work or trying to take care of your own family it's kind of hard to	2768	A
to to because an elderly person sometimes can be	2768	A
totally dependent you know on you and i know that's hard sometimes and but it would really have to be a last resort because that would just i- i would feel so guilty	2768	A
just i don't know unless i knew that they were somewhere just really	2768	A
i mean just really great like you know that they were really enjoying	2768	A
i don't know anyone personally that's in an an elderly home	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
yeah yeah	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
yeah	2768	A
yeah uh-huh	2768	A
to nod their head and smile at them	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
um	2768	A
um	2768	A
right	2768	A
oh	2768	A
oh	2768	A
that's something that i mean if i had to work	2768	A
in an elderly home i think- i don't think i could do it	2768	A
like i i would really like to be a teacher	2768	A
but i don't think i could do it because i'm very very emotional	2768	A
and the minute i mean the minute something happens i mean i cry on i mean you know Hallmark commercials but i'm just that's just the end of me	2768	A
and so i mean something real life i just i'm	2768	A
i uh interview a lot of children i'm an education reporter	2768	A
and i always go you know everyday i'm doing an education things and	2768	A
i meet these kids who are you know dropping out of school left and right and all the sudden they're in this program they're making straight A's they're going to graduate early	2768	A
and i'm just i just want to hug them and go you are just fantastic and you know if i can i can just imagine you know working in a home like that	2768	A
and those people they just they're so sweet and and so genuine	2768	A
you know and all they want is just for everything to be happy and you know	2768	A
and so that would probably just tear me apart everyday yeah i mean in a good way but you know	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
i'm sure	2768	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2768	A
yeah	2768	A
right yeah	2768	A
yeah	2768	A
and children i mean	2768	A
usually a lot of elderly people like to	2768	A
they like to uh share their experiences with the younger children they'll be telling them all kinds of stories that they don't even know what they mean but	2768	A
you know they feel like they've lived life so they need to share it and i'm sure i'll be like that too	2768	A
yeah	2768	A
but that's great i didn't know there were such groups	2768	A
uh-huh	2768	A
yeah yeah	2768	A
and i would hate it if anyone put me in one women	2768	A
yeah	2768	A
somebody take care of me	2768	A
oh goodness	2768	A
okay	2768	A
okay well nice to talk to you	2768	A
okay uh-huh bye-bye	2768	A
and uh what part of Virginia um	2756	A
Blacksburg okay i've been	2756	A
sounds vaguely familiar	2756	A
yeah okay	2756	A
yeah i- i hadn't been down in that part of the state really	2756	A
so	2756	A
uh i wish we did	2756	A
oh okay	2756	A
where all you guys go	2756	A
um-hum	2756	A
um-hum	2756	A
huh	2756	A
all these places that i've never been	2756	A
um	2756	A
well it really depends i mean uh	2756	A
seems like i do a lot in the Midwest lately um my um my fiancee's family's from Wisconsin	2756	A
and so we've been out there a couple of times and um i uh i went to Purdue for a couple of years so i've gone up to Indianapolis on occasion to visit friends	2756	A
and um	2756	A
uh	2756	A
i'm a real big baseball fan so i usually try to combine it with uh catching a couple of games somewhere	2756	A
i'm uh i'm a big Red Sox fan but uh i uh oh you're- you're a Red Sox fan too	2756	A
uh i usually try to catch whoever's in town though i don't specifically i you know go to Cleveland to see them play the Red- the Indians play the Red Sox	2756	A
um	2756	A
uh that's about it we don't i mean we do a lot of little trips around here um and um	2756	A
not that much we've gone out to um uh a place in western Pennsylvania called Falling Water uh	2756	A
have you ever heard of it	2756	A
yeah it's it's really neat it's this house built on on a waterfall and it's uh really cool um of course we keep picking crummy weather to go out there uh the first time we went out there was uh the day after hurricane Hugo had come through	2756	A
so i mean they they didn't have any power and it was really cold and and rainy and uh we went up about a year later and it was better but not a whole lot better	2756	A
so um where else did we go um	2756	A
we've gone to Richland last year and uh had a good time down there	2756	A
um my girlfriend has with her sisters but i haven't been down there um i hear that's nice we're going to get down probably down Norfork sometime this Summer just to see why catch a baseball game actually	2756	A
hum spend a day and a lot of money	2756	A
yeah i've heard uh i'm not real interested in Williamsburg because of the of the price attached to it we just we i	2756	A
hum	2756	A
yeah we all do that	2756	A
oh okay so i can wander around without	2756	A
oh okay i just have it pay somebody to get into the buildings	2756	A
oh okay i didn't know that yeah i think um	2756	A
you know they do the whole thing with you know paying a ridiculous amount of money to get get into one thing or another but they had a good time so	2756	A
hm	2756	A
um	2756	A
um-hum	2756	A
yeah i was um we use it live in California and um my um up up around San Francisco and um there was one year when my father was uh	2756	A
my father's company was starting to- to do stuff down in Los Angeles so my father was working down in Los Angeles for like um six months or so	2756	A
um actually it's closer to i think to a full year and you know we'd he'd fly down there on Mondays and fly back on Fridays well any time we had a school vacation or something like that we went down to Los Angeles so	2756	A
i saw i went to Disneyland about five times in one year and i really have no great urge to go back now	2756	A
oh it was great because uh well the times that were really fun were when uh we had vacation but the kids in Los Angeles didn't so we basically had run of the park um	2756	A
Disneyland i mean there's still a lot of people at Disneyland but there was another um another amusement park down there Busch Gardens um there was nobody there when we were there we got we won a log floating ride like five straight times we just get get done with them and they go oh do you want to go again and we'd say sure	2756	A
no i'd like to sometime but	2756	A
yeah i've never been the farthest south i've been on the East Coast is Charlotte so i um keep wanting to get south- further you know i thought i would go to Florida a couple summers ago but never did it	2756	A
my um my sister who lives in Charlotte and they've gone to Charleston a couple of times and had a real good time	2756	A
um	2756	A
yeah one of these days we'll get down there although	2756	A
i don't know when we're going to have vacation to do it	2756	A
we're um we're planning- getting married in about a year and our um our honeymoon we're going up to this um	2756	A
um place in Wisconsin called Door County it's up by Green Bay it's a place my girlfriend's also wanted to go and um	2756	A
it's um	2756	A
uh i don't if you've ever seen a map of Wisconsin but there's kind of like a little	2756	A
a little thing sticking out uh in the Lake Michigan that's Door County	2756	A
so	2756	A
yeah they call it the Cape Cod of the uh the Midwest so um	2756	A
we're thinking that'll be a lot of fun she um she had this uh book of pictures from it that were really nice kind of like a travel guide	2756	A
so um that that should be a lot of fun	2756	A
ooh	2756	A
oh boy	2756	A
oh that'll be fun	2756	A
well yeah you won't even notice it though	2756	A
yeah is that is that how you got into this uh this you know uh on the data base	2756	A
oh okay	2756	A
yeah i was i was just i mean most of the people i've talk to are from are from Texas so when i you know when i heard you were from Virginia i was like oh okay there's somebody different and you said oh i got somebody down in Texas i go okay that the connection right there	2756	A
um i um most people talk to Texas there's been a couple of other the people um most of whom are like me that work in in speech labs that are going to use the data base eventually	2756	A
so um it was fun i actually yesterday i ended up talking to somebody else from the same lab i'm in	2756	A
ooh	2756	A
um-hum	2756	A
um-hum	2756	A
uh that's neat i haven't uh i haven't had something like that happen just uh just getting the one guy from the lab	2756	A
um	2756	A
you're sure have a nice town uh my uh my sister lives on Lake Norman	2756	A
just	2756	A
yeah um we keep wanting to get down there and visit them over the summer and it's never really works out	2756	A
yeah	2756	A

uh-huh yeah it's real pretty	2756	B
well	2756	B

oh there's one in Salem Salem Rebels	2756	B
Salem Rebels	2756	B
Buccaneers oh okay	2756	B
oh is that right up there in Frederick uh-huh	2756	B
i've never been up there i've never visited Baltimore i'd like to go just sight see a little bit sometime	2756	B
uh-huh	2756	B
well uh we have done some minor repairs we're getting the house ready to sell	2746	A
and but i mean i really minor kinds of things you know like painting the painting the the smudge marks and uh uh	2746	A
gosh we haven't done anything uh real major	2746	A
um did some gardening did some landscaping i don't know that that counts as home repair	2746	A
um	2746	A
i would guess so i think the last thing we really did was was uh we had some gutters put up um	2746	A
and uh that made a big difference in terms of i mean the water was coming off the roof and just destroying the lawn	2746	A
i we moved here from- uh from New England about uh three years ago	2746	A
and uh we weren't quite prepared for the kinds of rains that uh you can get down here and uh	2746	A
but the gutter the the uh gutters made a big difference	2746	A
how about you	2746	A
no it well we bought the house new and uh it was kind of the you know you get what you pay for	2746	A
and uh we didn't invest in the gutters at the time	2746	A
no no	2746	A
definitely not in fact we still don't have them in the back yard yeah	2746	A
right	2746	A
oh yeah	2746	A
yeah	2746	A
yeah	2746	A
i don't think you	2746	A
yeah that's it i don't think you ever you're ever completely done	2746	A
um i know we had there's a lot of things we would have done if we'd stayed here uh we could use a shed out in the back	2746	A
and uh need to build could use- the kids could use some shelves in their rooms um	2746	A
but i don't think you know being a new home we wouldn't do any kind of major remodeling like redoing the kitchen or anything like that	2746	A
uh maybe in the new maybe in the new house	2746	A
the next house uh	2746	A
well we're we're going to stay in the area uh and uh	2746	A
uh we just it it turns out that this house was much bigger and more expensive than than we wanted to to invest in	2746	A
and uh so we decided that uh instead of throwing all our money- money into the house we'd uh we'd try to invest it a little better and uh that way uh uh uh	2746	A
you know it's it's it's just doesn't make sense to be house poor in these economic times you know what i mean	2746	A
it seems to be yeah it seems to be um	2746	A
the interest rates just went down i don't know i would imagine that's going to encourage more people to uh to look to buy a house	2746	A
um	2746	A
so uh	2746	A
well see	2746	A
i never had uh my wife uh parents did that they uh my wife's from New Hampshire	2746	A
and they bought this big old farm house	2746	A
which you know didn't even have indoor plumbing kind of thing	2746	A
and uh they converted the barn into a garage and built a couple of rooms above the barn	2746	A
and uh they did a lot of remodeling in that house and of course had plumbing put in	2746	A
and in fact our our first apartment- well our second apartment was what they did was they took a corner of the house and converted it into an apartment	2746	A
and my wife's grandfather is just really handy with uh tools and and and as a handyman kind of thing In fact he built his own house from scratch	2746	A
and and the funny thing about it is you you know you ask him well where did you learn to do that and he says well i read it in a book	2746	A
and so course course	2746	A
at the time that he lived that's when all the neighbors used to pitch in and help with that kind of thing and so	2746	A
i do too boy	2746	A
right yeah that would be uh and and he had it was a really nice house he did a really nice job but he he built an apartment for us	2746	A
built the whole kitchen and the whole thing i mean we had a a whole- whole uh uh	2746	A
self-contained apartment so uh and it was nice- nice	2746	A
i'm going to sneeze in a second i'm going wonder how they're going to uh record that um	2746	A
they uh	2746	A
have you it's uh pollen season i guess	2746	A
but uh what he did was this house is so big that now that he's retired and everything what they do is they have a home in Florida	2746	A
and he completed- and they in the Summer when it's just too hot to stay in Florida they go up to New Hampshire and he built himself an apartment in another corner of the house	2746	A
and he and his uh wife stay up there and then in the winter they go back to Florida and they live in a little trailer home in Florida	2746	A
yeah	2746	A
oh yeah	2746	A
yeah of course he's he built the shelves in the in the garage for me	2746	A
yeah yeah i'm sure he'd i'm sure he'd love to uh he he's getting a little impatient now because	2746	A
i guess he's uh in his early eighties now and uh he's still you know very active and uh but you know the hand's just not as steady as it used to be	2746	A
and drawing those lines they just don't seem to come out as straight as they used to and it frustrates him	2746	A
i mean this guy i mean i used to think it was amazing when he was in his sixties and seventies he used to climb out on the roof and do stuff and and uh i think if you didn't stop him he'd still do it today	2746	A
yeah	2746	A
yeah it's a lot of fun um our first house uh a real small house	2746	A
and uh i i did you know a lot of little things there i put put up my own gutters there and uh	2746	A
the uh being that it was in New England uh it was one of these little houses that was all electric	2746	A
and uh and New Hampshire at the time had the highest utility costs in the country	2746	A
so I was I mean we were just paying incredible bills during the long cold Winters	2746	A
so i had a uh wood stove put in big old wood stove put in in the basement and i built and i uh put in uh registers in the floors and stuff	2746	A
and it was a small house so that wood stove heated up the whole house and-	2746	A
oh yeah and uh the nice thing about up there is you know you could buy the wood pretty cheap	2746	A
in fact what you did was during the spring you'd order the wood when it was green and then by wintertime it had dried out and you could use it	2746	A
and you could get it really cheap when it was green	2746	A
so that was the trick where where where do you live	2746	A
oh okay	2746	A
yeah	2746	A
yeah	2746	A
right	2746	A
yeah that i think that that's always fun and and you know you can save a lot of money if you buy buy one of these homes that need some fixing up so long as it doesn't have foundation problems	2746	A
and uh you can do a lot of nice stuff	2746	A
you can uh i mean it can really be your home because you've put your touch on it you know	2746	A
if that's that's that was the nice thing about having a house built	2746	A
was that you got to pick you know the the floor plan and you got to pick the color of the carpet and and all this kind of stuff	2746	A
but uh yeah that's fun	2746	A
how long did you say you've been married	2746	A
oh	2746	A
oh those were the days i've got three kids now	2746	A
and they're getting to the point that's that's that's fun too you know talk about fixing up they're getting to the point where they're old enough to start pitching in	2746	A
and uh and helping with that kind of stuff	2746	A
oh	2746	A
yeah	2746	A
yeah that's nice i'd started to redo the basement in uh in our house in New Hampshire i was going to make it into like a family room	2746	A
and i'd started putting the flooring in and stuff but i never finished it the uh the uh	2746	A
we got transferred out here	2746	A
or actually got i i took the job out here and they moved me out here so uh	2746	A
excuse the buzzer	2746	A
oh that was the that's the hardest thing for us too	2746	A
yeah yeah	2746	A
oh yeah my my wife's uh house in New Hampshire had a pool table that	2746	A
okay	2746	B
so what is your latest home repair	2746	B
uh-huh	2746	B
right	2746	B
oh yeah	2746	B

uh-huh	2746	B
oh yeah	2746	B
and your house didn't have it on there before	2746	B
uh-huh	2746	B
huh	2746	B
i figures that was something they put on all houses i don't know	2746	B
oh really	2746	B

yeah i remember i've i've	2746	B
i just got married so i've only lived in an apartment and a duplex so i've you know	2746	B
have not owned a home yet	2746	B
but i remember my parents built their home and	2746	B
they had to they had a lot of lot of work in fact it was fifteen years ago and they're still uh	2746	B
trying to finish the basement and up you know it's a never ending process	2746	B
uh-huh	2746	B
yeah	2746	B
right	2746	B
where are you moving to	2746	B
uh-huh	2746	B

uh-huh	2746	B
um	2746	B
uh-huh	2746	B
oh cool	2746	B
oh wow	2746	B
yeah	2746	B
wish it was that way now don't you	2746	B
everybody could build each other's house for dirt	2746	B
huh	2746	B
okay	2746	B
i've been sneezing all day so	2746	B
yeah	2746	B
um	2746	B
uh-huh that's always nice to have	2746	B
to know somebody like that	2746	B
that can that's handy	2746	B
you ought to have him come down for a visit when you get your new house	2746	B
uh-huh	2746	B
um	2746	B
um-hum	2746	B
oh i'm looking forward to owning a house or	2746	B
getting a a small house that meets our needs and then fixing it up	2746	B
huh	2746	B
um	2746	B
yeah	2746	B
yeah my parents have one of those they do and they get really hot	2746	B
uh-huh	2746	B
huh	2746	B
i live in Sherman now i'm from Indiana	2746	B
so i've lived in Sherman three years	2746	B
work for TI	2746	B
and uh	2746	B
like i said i'm looking forward to maybe buying a house while the interest rate's still cheap and fixing it up	2746	B
yeah	2746	B
seems to be a lot of that	2746	B
uh-huh	2746	B
yeah	2746	B
uh not even a year yet	2746	B
oh really	2746	B
yeah	2746	B
my parents just got done fixing the house up again because_1 for	2746	B
our wedding you know and then my brother's graduation they finally finished the basement after like living there fifteen years they had an occasion to finish it so	2746	B
it was kind of neat to see it finally all come together	2746	B
uh-huh	2746	B
i i couldn't get used to the fact that houses down in Texas don't have basements	2746	B
because i love like big rec rooms you know and	2746	B
uh-huh	2746	B
oh	2713	B
oh okay what building do you work in	2713	B
oh okay okay	2713	B
oh okay okay	2713	B
i've only made a few um	2713	B
okay our topic for today is invasion of privacy so i got a good one	2713	B
when the phone rings and you've got a recording and this always happens like around five or six o'clock at night it rings and you get this recording and then it won't go away and any any of the type of solicitation that where they call all the time you know	2713	B
there are evenings especially Friday nights Thursday and Friday nights well we must get in the neighborhood of anywhere from three to six calls about that time of night more people call that's where you want to jerk the phone out of the wall you know your sitting down to eat and the phone rings and it's like	2713	B
i don't want anything thank you very much	2713	B
um-hum	2713	B
um-hum oh yeah	2713	B
yeah	2713	B
that's- that's that's real irritating to me	2713	B
uh-huh	2713	B
they can leave their whole spiel on it	2713	B
um yeah that a	2713	B
yeah that's that's a high irritant for me drives me crazy	2713	B
and it doesn't matter if you have an unlisted number or not because a lot of times these computer things	2713	B
will just	2713	B
make up numbers at random and just call them	2713	B
and so it really	2713	B
really doesn't make much difference as to whether or not	2713	B
you know you have a unlisted number or not and they pass around uh cards that have everybody's name on it like if you order something through a mail order catalog	2713	B
you know then you'll start getting a bunch of stuff in and a bunch of stuff and a bunch of stuff because they sell their customer list or they sell their catalog list of people to different companies	2713	B
and everything	2713	B
right right	2713	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2713	B
um-hum	2713	B
oh yeah oh yeah	2713	B
let's see i'm trying to think oh have you heard that that i'm trying to think of what company it was there was a company that was going to	2713	B
uh be giving out information	2713	B
about your financial status	2713	B
well um i work in the computer science center and so we hear a lot about things that are that computers are capable of doing	2713	B
and uh this was a software program	2713	B
that a company was developing that was going to have X amount of million peoples financial history and information on it	2713	B
and they were going to sell it to companies who would up in turn solicit you for business et cetera et cetera	2713	B
and uh they finally uh stopped production of it because of all the hullabaloo it caused because it was such a big deal and i wouldn't have been too thrilled about it either i mean there was a lot of stuff going on about it	2713	B
okay	2713	B
um-hum	2713	B
um-hum	2713	B
um	2713	B
um-hum	2713	B
um-hum	2713	B
um-hum well that's real interesting i know that a lot of times they ask for information that they don't really need on several things and	2713	B
you know your credit application- and that- all all they ever need you to do is give them permission to to pull a credit thing on on yourself and there it is that's all they really care about they just want that credit history to see if you're a liable person	2713	B
if you're going to go ahead and pay your bills on time and things like that	2713	B
kind of blow it off but so	2713	B
so i think i think the people who've who've been down that route or have had it to deal with anything like that have learned you know	2713	B
it's just one of those things you just do it and be done with it and don't worry about you know but i do know that there are several sites i didn't i wasn't aware that Austin was one of them but i think Johnson City was one	2713	B
yeah there's there's several of the cities that have been having real trouble with the issue	2713	B
and the but also on things that i'd heard too from a stockholders meeting was that	2713	B
there were people	2713	B
uh there were the same places where they had a real bad problem with people fighting it were also places they had a big bad problem with the drug usage too	2713	B
um-hum	2713	B
um-hum	2713	B
oh i don't think it's a	2713	B
necessary thing to publish it they just need to deal with it and on an individual basis i mean if they're going to do it just deal with it and be done with it	2713	B
um-hum	2713	B
um or	2713	B
well i think it's a safety factor too because you know when people are inebriated whether it's alcohol or drugs or whatever they are very unsafe for the their coworkers you know it's like	2713	B
you know my father was a fireman and i can just imagine if you know you know some guy being on drugs they go out there and and you know you've got somebody that's supposed to take care of you and they fall they fall out because of the drug issue you know	2713	B
i mean you can forgive somebody because all of a sudden they maybe get hurt or whatever that that you can understand but the blatant use of drugs or anything like that	2713	B
will uh be a problem	2713	B
i'm actually at work	2713	A
i- i'm in facilities and happen to have uh weekend duty here	2713	A
i'm in the South Building	2713	A
we we pull mostly evenings we are having there's three of us uh facilities managers are covering the off shifts	2713	A
just to have somebody here uh from management to uh	2713	A
see if they need anything	2713	A
oh the how many calls have you made	2713	A
okay i'm uh getting close to twenty this is the	2713	A
yeah hopefully you have a lot to talk about in this one but i don't really have a lot in this one usually i can talk for hours on most of the subjects they pick go ahead you first	2713	A
okay good	2713	A
oh yeah	2713	A
right	2713	A
yeah i the worst one i guess is like you when it's a recording i think- i don't mind so much someone calls and it's uh	2713	A
and it's a salesperson at least you can chat or whatever and say okay now we want to go and then when when they actually start off with a a computer and expect you to talk to a computer uh that's where i draw the line i just hang up immediately you know	2713	A
uh	2713	A
shut my other radio off here	2713	A
uh	2713	A
uh i guess they get their name i'm i'm amazed the i was- i was- question about that uh	2713	A
my concern would be everyone seems to have an answering machine and i have one too and they say that they can tie up your answering machine and just have a big long	2713	A
if they catch your answering machine	2713	A
yeah they have they they can erase all your others you know because if you have	2713	A
i think that's the way it is no mine i guess if it's full it it will not take it i'm not sure but they can certainly uh	2713	A
block your answering machine so someone else calls you uh and your answering machine is full you know it won't erase	2713	A
but your right that was a good one	2713	A
uh-huh	2713	A
uh-huh	2713	A
yeah	2713	A
i've got one it's not really an invasion of privacy but it's uh annoyance for me in the office with uh speaker phones you know i they're- they're great for an office but this one guy next to me who's not here just so i could talk about him	2713	A
he uses his speaker phone all the time and it carries over and so not only would you hear it seems to me that you talk longer for one thing- you kind of yell into it	2713	A
uh	2713	A
and so he yells into it and you hear the other person too so it's kind of a double annoyance he actually uh ruins my privacy you might say because the- the TI offices are so open anyway	2713	A
uh that i'm amazed that in fact i'm i'm about ready to say something uh if he's even thought of that that's a real	2713	A
uncourteous thing an an invasion of everyone else's time and and concentration to just be loud i don't know whether that's an invasion of privacy just being loud and	2713	A
and annoying you know uh that's perhaps not quite an invasion of privacy but i think it is and you- we both picked phone items there	2713	A
go ahead do you have any more	2713	A
oh yeah that's that's a good one too yeah i heard something about not that exactly but go ahead	2713	A
yeah	2713	A
uh-huh	2713	A
uh-huh	2713	A
well i uh heard something similar to that i listen to i'm a uh uh	2713	A
a talk show person	2713	A
and other words when i when i do my chores i put the radio- i'm a radio person i guess is what i mean and so i listened to was it five seventy which has continuous talk on the weekends	2713	A
and Neil Sperry and everybody i mean the lawyers and veterinarians and all that and uh i don't know if it was a lawyer or whatever it was talking about when you make out a financial- a financial application	2713	A
all that information on there is really not necessarily even a your social security number you know they you should just put down the basics and put N A where you don't want to answer	2713	A
whether it's your personal salary or whatever uh if your just making out a credit card application you don't need to put down	2713	A
and i was curious as to what- you know what specific things you- you did have to put down but he says social security you don't need to put that down there which i thought was surprising so maybe there's something along that same line where you know in all these	2713	A
financial uh applications that you make out you don't have to put all that stuff down there it would be nice to know what's what was	2713	A
of course of course they could say well i can't give you a card and you could say fine but you know some things will be private you know but he said just put N A and he said usually you'll get approved anyway because they just want your	2713	A
but if you don't feel like putting it down just put N A you know	2713	A
yeah yeah	2713	A
yeah	2713	A
i haven't i don't have any friends down at the the Austin plant but i heard that they were really upset about the drug thing and we seem to up here have just breezed through that and apparently some other companies are having trouble that i don't have any trouble with it	2713	A
uh it's kind of unusual here we are in Dallas you know	2713	A
the biggest location and and it just breezed through and wasn't really no one was i guess was really too concerned about it uh	2713	A
yet in Austin there there were whether it was a class action or how far it got i don't really know because TI	2713	A
only had a few things on TI News i think about it that they were objecting to but uh some people object to that which i don't mind	2713	A
uh problem at all you know	2713	A
hum	2713	A
yeah right	2713	A
right	2713	A
i know	2713	A
i know yeah i served my time too yeah	2713	A
yeah	2713	A
oh did- they object too	2713	A
um-hum	2713	A
yeah well i'm i'm all for it i	2713	A
uh it doesn't bother me that whether they do it in high schools or or you know carry it to wherever you want to carry it really uh	2713	A
uh of course that would really be a big thing in a public school but uh i'm saying certainly at work i have no problem with it uh	2713	A
uh and i think it is they they found that it's been very low really	2713	A
i guess maybe at the locations though i don't know if they have it done but done it by location i don't really know if uh they need to publish that really	2713	A
right	2713	A
right	2713	A
right	2713	A
but i think that was an actually- actually a good thing that happened uh i never considered it i guess it's an invasion of your privacy but it's something that is for the good of so many people you know to have everyone uh take the test randomly and uh	2713	A
and hopefully maybe some people will convince other people that are on drugs that well uh i might as well get off you know if i want to stay so uh you know if that was an invasion of privacy maybe it was good	2713	A
oh sure	2713	A
right	2713	A
um-hum	2713	A
right	2713	A
go ahead you got me more i this is this is a tough one i don't really haven't thought about any of this they had gardening yesterday and auto repairs and boy i could	2713	A
okay	2703	A
um well i'm not i mean i read a lot but i don't i don't read a whole i mean uh uh i i i i tend to read like only out of a couple	2703	A
you know groups uh i'm a and i'm uh i'm a big baseball fan so i tend to read a lot of uh baseball books and	2703	A
oh okay and uh i read a lot of science fiction	2703	A
um-hum	2703	A
um-hum	2703	A
um-hum	2703	A
um-hum	2703	A
yeah i um	2703	A
i don't really i probably i probably should i don't really read the self-improvement books or things like that i uh	2703	A
um i'll get like uh books on history and stuff like that that look interesting and i uh of course i don't ever get around to reading them	2703	A
you know i got uh um i belong- i belong to Quality Paperback Book Club	2703	A
and i'll get get stuff out of that like i got Battle Cry of Freedom you know like a couple of years ago and i started reading and got about sixty pages into it and it's like eight hundred pages and i was like	2703	A
uh i want to read something else for a while	2703	A
yeah	2703	A
yeah well especially you know well Battle Cry of Freedom starts off you know in the eighteen forties you know and it's like wait the war wasn't until the eighteen- you know it's like okay yeah realize these things drag- you know these things take awhile like to move up but it's	2703	A
you know it's hard sometimes	2703	A
i read a lot of science fiction yeah	2703	A
yeah that and i i did the same thing i	2703	A
yeah uh there's one science fiction writer named uh Allen Dean Foster	2703	A
oh okay yeah he um	2703	A
i must have like fifty or sixty books by him	2703	A
i mean i have- you know i have everything he's ever well almost everything he's ever done	2703	A
and um you know i i know that when i you know when i get his book i'm i'm usually going to enjoy it	2703	A
um so it's really you know it's it's fun to to do that um	2703	A
yeah well he does a lot of like um uh movie adaptations and things like that	2703	A
yeah and um his adaptations are usually really good um it's- it's funny he um	2703	A
the the novelization of Star Wars was listed- you know it it was out in the uh in the stores as being by George Lucas but it turns out that uh Foster actually uh ghost wrote it for him	2703	A
which you know when i read it i should have realized that because_1 i mean it had Foster's style written all over it yeah	2703	A
oh i'm sure he does	2703	A
i'd hope so well i mean he's doing all right probably	2703	A
yeah that's true	2703	A
oh yeah you you're a baseball fan you're you're aware of that kind of thing	2703	A
um-hum	2703	A
yeah i had a uh had a subscription to that last year but i'm uh i'm mostly a baseball fan so i'm i'm not as interested- you know the other stuff is interesting but um i was mostly interested in the baseball stuff	2703	A
uh actually i'm a Red Sox fan more than anything yeah	2703	A
um but uh i i i do like the Orioles also	2703	A
yeah	2703	A
Toledo	2703	A
i was in Toledo last summer went to a uh to a Mud Hens double header	2703	A
yeah it-	2703	A
yeah- i saved that issue actually um that's when i had the subscription yeah it was a lot of fun	2703	A
they don't exist anymore i don't	2703	A
think at least not by that name the the Iowa Cubs but i don't know if they play in the same location	2703	A
um-hum	2703	A
i minor league baseball i think is a lot more fun than major league baseball-	2703	A
and it's a lot cheaper	2703	A
yeah there's um there's a city just west of Frederick- of um Baltimore called Frederick it's about forty miles west and they have a minor league team and	2703	A
i go out there almost as much as the Orioles and um i it's just a lot of fun i mean it's free parking and three bucks- three- you know uh four bucks now to get in and you know the hot dogs are a dollar and and it's just great	2703	A
Oriole game if you park in the lot across the street from the stadium it's four bucks	2703	A
the ticket the cheapest- the cheapest ticket you can normally get is like six fifty to seven fifty	2703	A
yeah and um	2703	A
hot dogs like start at a dollar fifty	2703	A
oh that's nice	2703	A
yeah	2703	A
um-hum	2703	A
well how much are the box seats there do you know offhand	2703	A
yeah that's um	2703	A
that's a little steeper i think the most expensive seats in Memorial are eleven bucks but we're getting a new stadium next year so	2703	A
yeah it'll go up and	2703	A
if it well if it	2703	A
it's uh something we're really irritated about around here or some people are really irritated about they're they're building this new stadium- they built the new stadium downtown and they're saying how there's going to be a lot more parking for the stadium	2703	A
but i park for free up at at Memorial Stadium because i know where i can do it for free	2703	A
and um i'm not going to be able to do that downtown	2703	A
yeah we	2703	A
um-hum	2703	A
um-hum	2703	A
weren't you guys supposed to get a stadium downtown Dallas	2703	A
oh it didn't- it didn't go through	2703	A
oh okay	2703	A
um-hum	2703	A
yeah	2703	A
um-hum	2703	A
um-hum	2703	A
yeah that's that's what i'd always heard i've um	2703	A
um-hum	2703	A
yeah that's about what it takes me to get to Memorial	2703	A
um it's actually it's actually funny that um i live just outside of Baltimore and it takes me almost the same amount of time to go to Frederick that as it does to go to the to ballpark in Memorial- in uh Baltimore	2703	A
because um to go out to Frederick i just jump on the Interstate and because_1 i live just south of the Interstate hop- hop on the Interstate and the stadium's right off the Interstate	2703	A
so it's like i drive west and i'm there and you know and and then to go into Baltimore i mean it well it's fewer miles but i've got to go stop and go traffic and everything	2703	A
do you read um i guess you read Sports Illustrated but you don't read many sports books or	2703	A
um-hum	2703	A
um	2703	A
huh	2703	A
there was uh i understand there was a really good basketball book- book called uh A Season on the Brink	2703	A
yeah i'm not sure i don't know	2703	A
i i'm trying to think of the guy's name it was like John Feinstein or something like that wrote it i just heard about it the other night uh i was listening to something on the radio about uh	2703	A
you know a talk show about sports books and they and they mentioned that one	2703	A
yeah and uh i was thinking about there was a i saw a book kicking around on the history of the ABA which	2703	A
yeah i get in to even when i don't like the sport so much i get interested in the history of sports franchises and stuff-	2703	A
okay	2703	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2703	B
i'm a big baseball fan too	2703	B
exactly- well i like i teach school and so during the school year i just don't have time to read and i	2703	B
you know i would love to to be able to read more because i i enjoy it so much but with correcting papers and and i two of kids of my own i just don't have time but in the summer i try to read a lot	2703	B
and and of course being a woman i like romance novels and stuff like that a whole lot i just i really enjoy that because_1 it's kind of a	2703	B
of getaway type thing so i i read a lot of that but i also love sports and um	2703	B
uh i like- i i don't have time to read in but i do read Sports Illustrated in- during the the year because_1 my son gets that	2703	B
and uh but uh i don't read a lot of nonfiction and i really should because there's so many self-improvement books out right now that would would be benefit me greatly but i just don't	2703	B
yeah yeah	2703	B
oh do you	2703	B
uh-huh	2703	B
uh-huh	2703	B
oh my word	2703	B
yeah it's it's- some of those books are real tough to get into but after you get into them_1 they're really good	2703	B
but it's just tough to get through that first two hundred pages or so	2703	B
yes	2703	B
um-hum	2703	B
it's right that's right i find though that if when i find an author uh and you don't read a lot of fiction you said but when i find a do you	2703	B
when i find an author i really like i try- try to read everything they write	2703	B
because	2703	B
because you you get used to their style and you really enjoy it	2703	B
uh	2703	B
uh-huh i've heard of him	2703	B
is that right	2703	B
um-hum	2703	B
um-hum um-hum	2703	B
oh does he really	2703	B
oh	2703	B
is that right	2703	B
is that right uh-huh	2703	B
well i i have never read anything of his but i've heard about him but wouldn't you think he would does he get some royalties from that hopefully	2703	B
well i would think he would	2703	B
oh i'm sure he is i'm sure he is but sometimes the more you get the more you want too so yeah so	2703	B
oh yeah oh right right right	2703	B
i in fact i'm a sports fan period we i mean that's- that's why i like to read Sports Illustrated so much because_1 there's everything in it	2703	B
oh	2703	B
so you're probably uh a Baltimore fan right an Oriole fan	2703	B
is that right Boston oh well that's good too	2703	B
i'm- i'm sure you do well i'm a Ranger fan simply because_1 i live here but i i was uh i'm not from here i'm originally from Ohio so i've always	2703	B
followed the Tigers because you i was born and raised in Toledo yeah	2703	B
oh i love the Mud Hens they're great i love the name and there was a big- really big article on the Mud Hens in Sports Illustrated last year	2703	B
did you	2703	B
oh	2703	B
yeah	2703	B
yeah i like- i really enjoy that team i used- we used to go there all the time i used to live in Iowa too and they have the Iowa Oaks and we used to go go to their games all the time and	2703	B
i know i know they don't	2703	B
oh they must they must have changed then because it used well i haven't lived there for long- i've been here for like twelve years now so	2703	B
and i haven't been back to Des Moines in a long time but	2703	B
we used to always go to their games and it was kind of fun it's almost uh more fun than going to a major league game i don't know i just really enjoy the	2703	B
the farm teams	2703	B
yeah- yeah it is it's not quite so serious you know	2703	B
that's for sure that's for sure	2703	B
is that right	2703	B
is that right	2703	B
well how like how much is an Oriole game	2703	B
oh gosh see it's higher than the Rangers	2703	B
oh yeah and the food here is outrageous but uh you can get a good seat for uh well it used to be three dollars but i think it's gone up to four- four dollars this year	2703	B
but you know it's in the bleachers way out in the you know center field but it's still nice you still can see well	2703	B
box seats run from oh like eight dollars to twelve dollars	2703	B
oh	2703	B
oh	2703	B
oh so it'll go up	2703	B
um-hum	2703	B
oh oh	2703	B
uh that's yeah that's a bummer	2703	B
well see baseball here though is the cheapest game in town because the Cowboys it's outrageous- it's outrageous to go to the Cowboy game	2703	B
and the Mavericks are too- it's high too so baseball's cheap compared to other games	2703	B
well that didn't go so- over now they they they decided you know George Bush who who's the main- main owner of the Rangers decided that uh	2703	B
they'd stay in Arlington so Arlington's going to build a stadium a bigger one	2703	B
so we're going to stay- they're going to stay there and which is fine because Arlington's got a lot of things to offer and	2703	B
and that was their main main money making you know deal for the city and it would have devastated them_1 if they would have taken it away	2703	B
because everything there's Six Flags right by the stadium there's a Wet'n Wild uh and it you know that's all the tourists come there and	2703	B
and they it would have been devastated they would have collapsed so i'm kind of glad they're staying there because it's right in the middle of Fort Worth Dallas and you know	2703	B
yeah	2703	B
we you know we like- i like it there and i think Dallas has enough to offer that they don't have to hog everything so i'm glad that they're staying in Arlington	2703	B
and it's takes us maybe uh well- well thirty five to forty minutes to get there from Plano which is not bad at all	2703	B
yeah so	2703	B
is that right	2703	B
uh-huh	2703	B
oh gosh	2703	B
yeah	2703	B
yeah yeah	2703	B
well not really now my son does i have i have a son that just turned sixteen and he reads everything he gets he gets his get his hands on he's reading a Dick Vitelle book right now because_1 he's a real big Dick Vitelle fan he's a basketball fan because_1 he	2703	B
he plays for the high school he goes to and uh just loves Dick- Dick Vitelle which not many people do so but he's reading it and he's reading- and he says he's so interesting mom you just can't believe all the things he's done and	2703	B
he's really enjoying that i and he said mom you need to read it after i get finished so maybe i will	2703	B
never heard that one	2703	B
um-hum	2703	B
hm	2703	B
um-hum	2703	B
i'll have to tell my son about that i'm sure he'd like it	2703	B
oh that would be good	2703	B
okay Nancy what do you think about drug testing	2763	A
uh-huh	2763	A
all right	2763	A
yeah	2763	A
yeah do you feel that	2763	A
but	2763	A
right	2763	A
what do you think company should do if they find someone that	2763	A
tests positive	2763	A
um	2763	A
would you help them_1 get into a drug rehab program	2763	A
uh-huh	2763	A
uh probably about the same thing just uh	2763	A
give them_1 a chance you know with a positive have them_1 sit down with their boss and their boss's boss and uh you know just talk with them about	2763	A
what happened what the problem was	2763	A
possibility- there's a possibility that uh	2763	A
you know you've got to give somebody a benefit of the doubt because everybody would probably say oh well that's just you know i just tried it once to see what it'd be like	2763	A
yeah so you pretty much got to give everybody one shot	2763	A
and then after that you might want to	2763	A
and and if they admit to having a problem or something you know i would help them_1 out as as long as they wanted help and would stay in the program i'd you know help them_1 out	2763	A
yeah	2763	A
right	2763	A
yeah	2763	A
what if along a similar topic straying from the drug thing what about	2763	A
what do you think about AIDS testing for	2763	A
uh say you're a physician and uh a patient comes in and wants treated should you have the right to test them for AIDS	2763	A
yeah	2763	A
in advanced cases yes	2763	A
right	2763	A
see that's a question i'm wondering because i'm pursuing a career in medicine	2763	A
and you know they're deciding that in the courts you know as i'm continuing my education	2763	A
so it would- you know by the time i get out and begin practicing then	2763	A
i don't know you you know- or could be either way i would definitely want to know if these people have AIDS i mean i'm the	2763	A
but	2763	A
and	2763	A
that's	2763	A
it's such a tough issue i- i just wanted to throw that out to you to make the conversation a little more interesting because_1 since we both agree it's kind of hard to	2763	A
yeah	2763	A
huh	2763	A
yeah	2763	A
uh you work for TI	2763	A
oh oh	2763	A
uh	2763	A
is that how you got on the	2763	A
phone program	2763	A
my wife works for TI yeah	2763	A
yeah	2763	A
yeah wow	2763	A
yeah	2763	A
yeah	2763	A
yeah	2763	A
right	2763	A
uh-huh	2763	A
huh	2763	A
well it's pretty serious	2763	A
yeah a lot of it is for sure	2763	A
that's right	2763	A
yeah	2763	A
right	2763	A
well that's good	2763	A
yeah good	2763	A
huh	2763	A
wow	2763	A
well that's good	2763	A
well Nancy it's been good talking to you	2763	A
well thank you and uh i guess i'll brace myself for a heavy storm coming my way	2763	A
all righty	2763	A
bye	2763	A
i'm all for it	2763	B
because i- i think if you don't do it you don't have anything to worry about it	2763	B
you shouldn't do it and that's in a nutshell and i think you know i say if you if you don't do it you really- really don't have to worry about it	2763	B
well i you- just uh like i say i just think it's a a fine idea and i the companies that i've heard that had a random testing i think it's a great idea uh where i work they don't	2763	B
do random testing and uh now when i hired in i had to have a uh	2763	B
a drug test which was fine with me i- i wasn't worried at all about that but and then i think that's perfectly i don't think it's infringing on your rights or i think the company has a right to have employees that are drug free	2763	B
well	2763	B
i guess i'd give them_1	2763	B
i'd give them_1 one chance maybe i- i don't know person i'd fire- if it was my company i'd fire them_1 right then but not- you know in today's society you can't do that yeah i guess you guess have to give them a a warning and then then the second time they'd be terminated	2763	B
if they tested positive	2763	B
and i really would watch them_1 after that but uh	2763	B
i'd probably send them_1 on a EAT program you know Employee Assistance Program i'd i'd make them_1 go through that	2763	B
and uh the first time they'd have to go through the EAT program	2763	B
and i think most companies have those now i think they have it must be a law or something because_1 awful lot of companies have them_1	2763	B
and i'd make them_1 do that	2763	B
and if they refused to do that then they'd be fired	2763	B
way i'd do it what would you do	2763	B
yeah	2763	B
or maybe it's a my antihistamine i was on that you know tested positive i- i don't do it you know you never know if they're telling the truth or not	2763	B
second chance- yeah yeah	2763	B
yeah	2763	B
right	2763	B
right	2763	B
but if they flat refused you know and said no i won't then i'd say well then i'm sorry then you can't say we're not going to have druggies in our payroll the way i'd look at it	2763	B
fortunately i've never had to worry about that since i- i have never even	2763	B
tried uh a puff or whatever it uh you know and if somebody gave me a thousand dollars and said Nancy go by some dope- i wouldn't even know where to go buy it i'm sure you can at any high school or any street corner they tell me but i don't know	2763	B
uh	2763	B
i guess if he suspected sure i wouldn't- because if i was a physician i wouldn't want to	2763	B
test them_1 i mean i wouldn't want to treat them_1 for fear that they would you know i i'd get that but	2763	B
i think if if you suspect it and i'm sure a doctor can look at somebody and suspect don't you think by looking at them_1	2763	B
yeah not probably not at the first i don't know	2763	B
i don't know if you if they have the right or not	2763	B
i never- had never really thought of that	2763	B
uh-huh	2763	B
uh-huh	2763	B
you're right	2763	B
oh i would too absolutely absolutely i just don't uh	2763	B
and i would if i were a doctor i wouldn't	2763	B
i- i don't think it's anything wrong for a doctor to refuse to i don't care about the Hippocratic oath i don't think they should have to treat a patient with AIDS if they don't want to you know why take a chance like that doctor in New York that got infected from a patient and you know she ended up i think	2763	B
she died i don't remember if she died or not but she's suing that hospital because	2763	B
uh she was working with uh with a AIDS patient that got them_1	2763	B
so i- i don't know i don't think i would uh	2763	B
treat one	2763	B
you're	2763	B
isn't that totally boring	2763	B
oh me well uh no i like i say i've only been tested the one time when i hired in uh i had was tested for drugs	2763	B
and of course they do everybody you can't work where i work unless you're tested for it and so that you know and that was fine with me but they make you do all the sealing you know you you have to do everything yourself they're not allowed to seal them_1 or	2763	B
tag them_1 or anything you you do it all yourself they tell you what to do but you do it all yourself	2763	B
so if there's a mistake it's your mistake i guess	2763	B
i don't know	2763	B
no i did years ago for seventeen years i worked uh in Fort Worth at a a landing gear company Menasco	2763	B
and uh love it just love it i wish i'd found this company twenty years ago but	2763	B
so i started out at TI years ago my daughter works at TI	2763	B
yeah because_1 she was on it and she how did you get on it	2763	B
oh does she	2763	B
yeah i liked TI i loved it i quit- quit back in eighty five uh and went with Martin Marietta down in Orlando	2763	B
and just hated Orlando- Orlando just oh yeah just hated it couldn't wait to get back and it took me about almost four years to get back but i made it	2763	B
uh but i love TI i really- i really enjoyed working there and uh	2763	B
but you know it wasn't to be anymore	2763	B
had to move on	2763	B
but uh yeah they- you know i know they do the random testing at TI	2763	B
and i- i- i don't see anything wrong with that	2763	B
if you know if they i don't even know they don't even have to do it on suspicion they can- they can just do it and uh	2763	B
and they do it quite often i understand	2763	B
and i don't blame them_1 at all i mean	2763	B
their company and	2763	B
you're a danger to people if you're on drugs and i think you're a danger to to people that you work with and then they have too much sophisticated equipment out there to have somebody out you know doped up working around it i think	2763	B
so uh	2763	B
and i understand that they even if even if you see somebody off you know away from work using drugs	2763	B
that you can come back and and rat on them_1 and they'll get them_1 that way	2763	B
if you see them at a party to you know doing dope you can go back to work and tell on them_1	2763	B
is what i've understand- i've heard	2763	B
yeah it is they're they're cracking down on them_1 but uh that's good you know somebody needs to get tough on these guys you know and you know and they	2763	B
take them_1 to court and then they just slap them_1 on the hand and let them_1 the dealers out and you know i just makes me sick i that's why we have so much crime i know it's because_1 of dope	2763	B
i know when i was	2763	B
growing up you could sleep with your windows open well even my kids were growing up we didn't lock our house at night we just went to bed you know and left the doors open the windows open you could walk- take walks at night you can't do that anymore	2763	B
and i think most of it's drug related most of the crime that we have is drug related	2763	B
and uh i- i don't i don't think my children have ever	2763	B
if they did i didn't know it	2763	B
but i know they've never been on it if they ever tried it i didn't know it and because_1 my son was a	2763	B
athlete and athletes normally can't	2763	B
don't do it because they're you know they have to stay in shape my daughter- my daughter just wasn't the type she just didn't care for stuff like that and neither one of them_1 smoked cigarettes either so that's that's	2763	B
yeah i really is i did when they were growing up and i think- that's why they don't because i did and i quit about ten years ago	2763	B
and the smartest thing i ever did	2763	B
took shots from a doctor in Richardson	2763	B
and haven't had a puff since	2763	B
she gave shots in the nose and in the ears and in the arm six shots and that's it never smoked again	2763	B
so	2763	B
yeah i'm real proud of myself	2763	B
good nice talking to you if i can will um good luck on it	2763	B
oh you you please do	2763	B
talk to you bye-bye	2763	B
sure go ahead	2792	A
oh i like all kinds of books	2792	A
mostly uh something i like like true life	2792	A
not uh you know documentaries or real stories about real people and that kind of stuff or dramas in real life	2792	A
and uh i also like romantic novels	2792	A
i like uh	2792	A
i like Readers' Digest believe it or not i usually read that from cover to cover	2792	A
i like it because there's a little bit of everything in it	2792	A
you know that kind of a thing uh as far as like real novels	2792	A
i haven't gotten into Shakespeare or any of that type of thing	2792	A
i wish i had in some- in some senses but i don't have time really as much as i would like to to get into that kind of thing	2792	A
how about you	2792	A
uh-huh	2792	A
sure	2792	A
uh-huh	2792	A
uh-huh	2792	A
yeah yeah	2792	A
yeah	2792	A
uh jeez let me think it i tell you i haven't read a book in a long time	2792	A
and it i can't even really remember uh i think it was a romantic novel by Danielle Steel or one of those you know yeah honestly um i don't do as much reading like i say as i would like to	2792	A
we've been working a lot of hours at work and	2792	A
yeah and then of course we have a home so it's	2792	A
you know a lot time is spent doing things as far as the yard work or housework or you know that type of thing	2792	A
but see i do crafts too so it's hard i if i have a minute that's what i do- i do	2792	A
and-	2792	A
that's the and and that's like myself i've i've i've miss it because i really find it a very relaxing hobby too	2792	A
i really do and um	2792	A
i don't know it seems like you can get lost in a book you know it it it's like an escape for me i don't know about you	2792	A
it's if i'm really interested in what i'm reading i mean hours can go by and i i look up at the clock and say oh my word you know	2792	A
in fact i'd rather read sometimes than watch TV	2792	A
but i think you get out of the habit like you say you have to like kind of set yourself	2792	A
yep	2792	A
no	2792	A
yeah right see that's the other problem i have if i start into something and i really enjoy what i'm reading	2792	A
then i have a terrible time getting away from it too i'll stay up until two or three o'clock in the morning	2792	A
you know because_1 i'm so engrossed in it and then before you know it it's time to get up and go to work you know that type of thing	2792	A
i don't know what you would call it maybe i have a problem	2792	A
it's terrible i i really like books that that you can get into and that's sense	2792	A
oh yeah you do you kind of get relaxed that's true	2792	A
i have a lot of craft books that i have too and uh magazines i like People you know those things that are about real people	2792	A
and um	2792	A
i i like to uh read about people who've been a successful know who've who made a success of their lives	2792	A
uh	2792	A
to- to to give you specific titles i can't- i can't like i say haven't done it in	2792	A
in such a long time	2792	A
um well i went to uh seminar on uh	2792	A
it was for by American business and some of the people uh what the heck was his name i'm trying to think he's one of the uh Paroe and um	2792	A
it was more like oh it there was tapes and things that they had about him too	2792	A
how he started out as just a salesman and now he's you know multimillionaire and that type of thing and uh how you have to uh be aggressive and you know really want something for yourself and that type of stuff	2792	A
it's like up to you in other words whatever happens in your life it's not up it's not someone else you have to do it	2792	A
and i find that fascinating that people you know can do that kind of thing	2792	A
just make up their minds that that's it you know have this one direction	2792	A
do it i can't i'm not that focused on something i i'm off in all directions um and i'm not uh um a planner which i wish i was	2792	A
you know kind of off the wall if someone says do you want to do this tonight uh and i got a mountain of things to do it's okay you know we do it	2792	A
i know i know but i wish i was more the other way	2792	A
yeah right i i that's see i like it that way though i i i would i don't want to change that part of me	2792	A
that's funny uh even though i admire someone who isn't	2792	A
like i am you know and and i wish i could be more that way but	2792	A
that's true that's true how many people do you supervise	2792	A
oh that's not bad	2792	A
that's not bad at all	2792	A
do you like your job	2792	A
oh that's	2792	A
oh that's important do you have a family	2792	A
oh uh-huh	2792	A
do you like it	2792	A
i i loved i loved Abilene too that's what i liked too is the weather	2792	A
except for tornados	2792	A
yes they do and it it it's so surprising how it just happens you know	2792	A
unpredictable	2792	A
uh no oh i've been up here about three uh we were down there uh from eighty six to	2792	A
eighty five to eighty six uh no uh eighty- well part of eighty four to eighty six i should say	2792	A
oh wow	2792	A
oh jeez	2792	A
i know the whole situation is bad	2792	A
up here we're having a terrible time with the recession	2792	A
yeah	2792	A
yeah it's not good at all	2792	A
i know things are pretty booming down there	2792	A
i heard they sold Johnson City though	2792	A
and Colorado Springs	2792	A
oh wow	2792	A
amazing	2792	A
oh well that's good at least they kept the business part of it	2792	A
it's scary though i'm telling you	2792	A
and i don't know and well you know with the other part of this thing was how do you feel that this influences family	2792	A
that that books influence do you know how to use them in your life or to influence	2792	A
i i feel like it's important for young children to read too and what you read to them	2792	A
when my children were were younger course they were all married and grown and i have grandchildren now they were uh i i read to them a lot	2792	A
and uh i think they've all developed kind of an interest in reading also i'm not saying they read all the right things but they do read uh where a lot of people don't have any interest in it at all and i think it's important	2792	A
because uh even today where people are so illiterate and they go off to school and really nothing happens i mean they don't learn anything it's because they can't read	2792	A
yeah	2792	A
oh it's so unbelievable isn't it	2792	A
yeah	2792	A
exactly and i think that that's why reading is so important	2792	A
because uh i think even mentally when you can do some	2792	A
okay	2792	B
what kind of books do you like to read	2792	B
yeah	2792	B
um-hum	2792	B
uh-huh	2792	B
yeah so do i	2792	B
yeah	2792	B
right	2792	B
um-hum	2792	B
um	2792	B
well i like like you said real life um i like uh biographies of people's lives like especially like athletes for some reason it seems to interest me like people that make a big comeback or	2792	B
you know Orel Hershiser things like that	2792	B
and um	2792	B
i like to read books on improve like family marriage	2792	B
you know things that are written by like Christian authors or um	2792	B
doctors about family and you know how to improve your home and all that kind of thing um i like to read- the magazines i to read- like- i like to read Readers' Digest i read a lot of bicycling magazines	2792	B
they're i mainly look at the pictures and stuff but they just usually have some good articles in them_1	2792	B
but uh i don't know i haven't really found any romance type stuff i like to read i i'm more true you know fiction- uh nonfiction i haven't found a lot of uh fiction books that i really like	2792	B
but uh not to say i wouldn't eventually i mean what was the last book you read	2792	B
really	2792	B
yeah	2792	B
really	2792	B
i know	2792	B
yeah	2792	B
i set- i set a goal for myself to read a book a month this year which is	2792	B
like about eleven more books than i would have read last year but so far i've only read like two books and so i'm not doing very well but	2792	B
yeah	2792	B
yeah i find it's real hard i let papers newspapers stack up and magazines stack up if i don't really set aside a time to look or or read them_1	2792	B
yeah	2792	B
uh-huh	2792	B
yeah- yeah- yeah	2792	B
uh-huh	2792	B
yeah oh i would too	2792	B
um	2792	B
kind of train your mind	2792	B
have you ever read uh or heard of the book This Present Darkness	2792	B
that was one of the books i read this year and it's really fast paced and intense	2792	B
it was a nonfiction book or is a a fiction book but it was a real- it was one of the best i've read i mean it was it was real good and it was um	2792	B
it was one of the few books that like it you know just hurry up and go through without putting down you know	2792	B
um-hum	2792	B
yeah	2792	B
uh-huh	2792	B
no i'm sure it's	2792	B
fast or something	2792	B
uh-huh	2792	B
i know what you mean	2792	B
i like reading late at night right before i go to bed sometimes i just sleep better or something	2792	B
but uh	2792	B
uh-huh	2792	B
yeah	2792	B
which what book have you read that is along those lines	2792	B
that was really good	2792	B
well how about who	2792	B
do you know who it was about	2792	B
uh-huh	2792	B
yeah	2792	B
yeah	2792	B
and then do it	2792	B
uh-huh	2792	B
uh-huh well that's all right	2792	B
you're more fun though see you're not ridged right	2792	B
that's good	2792	B
yeah	2792	B
there may be some schools you could read about and learn	2792	B
uh about twenty	2792	B
no	2792	B
no	2792	B
sometimes	2792	B
sometimes more than others but yeah i do i've been there about three years	2792	B
yeah i just got married last year and	2792	B
um most of my family's in Indiana	2792	B
so i've only been in Texas three years	2792	B
yeah i do i love the weather down here	2792	B
yeah i know	2792	B
boy they they have storms here i've	2792	B
hail and thunder and	2792	B
yeah	2792	B
were you here during the hailstorm two years ago	2792	B
yeah boy	2792	B
i had thirty three hundred dollars damage done on my car a lot of people had their cars totaled	2792	B
just from hail	2792	B
i think State Farm went bankrupt just about	2792	B
but uh	2792	B
really	2792	B
hm	2792	B
yeah and Colorado Springs	2792	B
yeah i talked to a guy on the phone on this the other day and he was telling me about it	2792	B
they just sold it	2792	B
closed up and moved down to McKinney	2792	B
yeah	2792	B
i know	2792	B
how do i feel what	2792	B
uh-huh	2792	B
yeah	2792	B
that's good	2792	B
that's real yeah	2792	B
oh yeah	2792	B
yeah it's really surprising how many people graduate from high school and that i work with and people i mean i get memos all the time across my desk and things are misspelled and it's really	2792	B
it's pretty sad a lot of people that work for me that can't even spell or read you know	2792	B
yeah	2792	B
um i was thinking about the uh the topic you know while they were searching for a person	2740	A
and uh while i was thinking about it i just flipped on my TV	2740	A
and it was funny because i thought about today how so much of	2740	A
i mean i even my social life is renting movies or sitting at home and you know watching a rented movie or watching a movie on TV	2740	A
and just now it's so i mean every- everything is just so uh easy that you almost don't have to think of things to do anymore	2740	A
you know what i mean	2740	A
yeah	2740	A
i mean i remember when i was little my friends uh my parents i'm sorry would just go over people's houses and just sort of you know sit and talk	2740	A
and before TV and all that people would sit and listen to the radio and and that i mean life has just changed and become so much more modernized and uh it's really pretty incredible	2740	A
oh really	2740	A
i know	2740	A
uh-huh	2740	A
and you know when you think about oh i was watching reruns of Happy Days the other day and um	2740	A
to think that that was the social life of teenagers to go to uh you know a a place like Arnold's and order a soda pop	2740	A
and uh you know sit and hang out and and you know just the dress codes the whole atmosphere the whole attitude of teenagers and social life was totally different then	2740	A
uh-huh	2740	A
uh-huh	2740	A
i know	2740	A
i know and also um i think that it's so much more dangerous for people now	2740	A
i mean before you could go out and and you know you didn't have all the drunk drivers and you didn't have to worry about your kids getting into the wrong crowds and this and that	2740	A
and now that's really a problem	2740	A
you know but what what do you do most of the time for social activities	2740	A
oh okay	2740	A
uh-huh	2740	A
yes	2740	A
yes	2740	A
uh-huh	2740	A
uh-huh	2740	A
yeah i i definitely agree	2740	A
um are your you can't drive yet then can you	2740	A
okay oh in a few months you said oh that's good well you're going to find that driving changes your social life completely	2740	A
i mean suddenly when you're free to go where you want to go it's amazing i mean i don't know if you'll always have a car around that's a different issue	2740	A
but um uh just even being able to go to a movie when you want and and not relying on somebody else it's really pretty nice	2740	A
but um	2740	A
one thing i love to do and maybe it's just because i like to eat	2740	A
but one of my favorite things to do with friends is just go out and try a new restaurant	2740	A
and uh and i don't know just go and i don't know try like a a new ethnic restaurant you know Indian food or or something like that	2740	A
and i think so often we do social things like you were saying you know going out and picking up guys or or whatever social things that don't really	2740	A
are that aren't really social like when you go to a movie you're not sitting and talking to anybody	2740	A
and when you go to a bar it's usually so loud or so crowded that you even that you can't talk to anybody	2740	A
you know um and going out to dinner i think is a nice way you're out you're out of the house um	2740	A
i think playing games is something that my friends and i love to do	2740	A
we've um we've bought Pictionary you probably know that and i don't know some other games and um and i know this sounds kind of corny but	2740	A
it really is	2740	A
and if you get the right group of friends	2740	A
they have a good attitude about it then you know you can have a pretty good time	2740	A
uh-huh	2740	A
i personally think that i should have been born in the fifties because i do i do love that era and uh	2740	A
and i really think that i could have gotten into i don't know the the music and the lifestyle and um things just seemed so much easier didn't they	2740	A
you know it just seems like you didn't have so much to worry about	2740	A
yeah	2740	A
yeah that's true	2740	A
well who knows maybe another maybe the the twenty first century will bring a whole new type of social life	2740	A
yeah	2740	A
i get very frustrated when i go over to a friend's house and all they want to do is sit and play computer games	2740	A
you know i i don't know if you're familiar with any of them but	2740	A
they're they're fun you know and they're they're you know not bad to like take up some time but they just are so um exclusive	2740	A
you know you get two people in front of a computer playing a computer game and the the next room could be on fire	2740	A
and they'll never know it you know	2740	A
but	2740	A
well it was nice talking to you	2740	A
yeah and gosh i hope you guys cool off down there	2740	A
okay	2740	A
all righty bye-bye	2740	A
uh-huh	2740	B
uh-huh	2740	B
uh-huh	2740	B
yeah	2740	B
yeah	2740	B
i do and like even even little kids who watch like Sesame Street and everything's really fast paced and they don't have to to sit down and concentrate on one thing for a long time and	2740	B
yeah	2740	B
yeah	2740	B
yeah just the other day i uh some AM station or something had a um	2740	B
like a radio show just like the old days you know it was like from the old days and i was thinking gosh that's i mean because you have to imagine what everybody looks like and you don't understand it until you actually hear it and have to do it and it's i mean you know it's just too bad that everybody has everything fed to them	2740	B
yeah	2740	B
yeah i mean now we always have to do something new or better or more exciting can't just sit around and talk for awhile you know	2740	B
it's too bad	2740	B
yeah	2740	B
uh-huh	2740	B
yeah it really is	2740	B
um just	2740	B
well i'm fifteen so	2740	B
oh just a lot of times we do sit around and	2740	B
because like uh i'm really glad that i'm in like uh the classes uh like honors classes and so it's like what's really good about that is that you meet people who really are interested in in talking about things and discussing world issues and	2740	B
it just and it makes me sick to go to school and know people who just that's all they do is like go out and you know try to go find a new guy or something it's just so immature and oh just futile you know	2740	B
no i'll be driving in a few months	2740	B
yeah	2740	B
yeah	2740	B
yeah	2740	B
uh-huh	2740	B
yeah it is	2740	B
yeah	2740	B
yeah	2740	B
yeah	2740	B
yeah	2740	B
yeah	2740	B
yeah	2740	B
uh-huh	2740	B
uh-huh	2740	B
yeah	2740	B
it was it does sound corny but it's so much fun	2740	B
yeah	2740	B
yeah you really can	2740	B
awesome	2740	B
yeah	2740	B
yeah yeah	2740	B
i know everybody's i mean everybody's always busy and worried and so many problems people don't just sit down and you know just talk and know everything's going to be okay	2740	B
yeah yeah things go in cycles you know maybe	2740	B
oh yeah	2740	B
uh-huh	2740	B
oh yeah	2740	B
oh that's the truth	2740	B
yeah nice talking to you	2740	B
yeah	2740	B
talk to you later bye	2740	B
all right	2772	A
okay	2772	A
oh uh-huh	2772	A
uh-huh	2772	A
oh okay	2772	A
uh-huh	2772	A
hum	2772	A
well right now we're having the the little little bit of spring that we have yeah	2772	A
we we don't have many seasons here it goes from winter to summer usually	2772	A
uh spring usually consists of a lot of rain excuse me especially thunderstorms	2772	A
i don't know we've got we had one of those blow through tonight	2772	A
and i think we got the same thing in the forecast for the next two or three days	2772	A
so	2772	A
it's	2772	A
uh it's gotten up to uh ninety a couple of times	2772	A
uh but basically been in the the low seventies and eighties	2772	A
yeah it's not really been too bad because_1 usually it sneaks on into the nineties a little earlier	2772	A
yeah quite a bit in fact the the season- well the season's just about over for that uh in fact we drove down to Corpus last week	2772	A
and uh there- there were still some indian paint brushes and bluebonnets down along the way	2772	A
funny we drove through San Antonio and i spoke to somebody else this morning from San Antonio	2772	A
yeah we're	2772	A
they had that we came back what day was that	2772	A
Sunday evening and they had a a big rainstorm come through there part of the same thing we're getting now i guess	2772	A
yeah this that's the second or third year in a row that we've had a real rainy spring we had a pretty rainy fall last year as well	2772	A
um we had a few down here but but not anything like Kansas and this is the season for that	2772	A
they do they do pop up occasionally around here	2772	A
yeah	2772	A
yeah i'm i'm from here originally so July and August i'm pretty well used to the hundred degree temperatures and stuff	2772	A
the the biggest problem with with the with the weather and the rain in this area is the the soil it's that black clay soil	2772	A
it's kind of sandy- you know it's not sandy like most of the state is so it doesn't absorb	2772	A
the water real well i mean once it rains a little bit it's	2772	A
it's filled up and everything else just runs off so	2772	A
yeah	2772	A
yeah we have it especially- especially as rainy as it's been in the last couple of years there's a	2772	A
uh there's a section in South Dallas that has had a whole lot of flooding problems because of the rain	2772	A
really	2772	A
huh	2772	A
uh-huh	2772	A
uh-huh	2772	A
uh-huh	2772	A
hm	2772	A
yeah	2772	A
uh-hum	2772	A
um-hum	2772	A
huh uh-huh	2772	A
yeah	2772	A
hm	2772	A
i guess i'd prefer that	2772	A
to the way uh	2772	A
yeah	2772	A
um-hum	2772	A
yeah	2772	A
we- we it's pretty dry we get some when it's this rainy but it's nothing like i guess San Antonio summers it's nothing like Houston	2772	A
for instance it'd be or east Texas is a little more humid	2772	A
huh	2772	A
uh-huh	2772	A
um	2772	A
yeah	2772	A
yeah probably the Pacific breezes make a lot of difference in that	2772	A
that's nice	2772	A
yeah my wife's originally from Virginia and we lived there for about nine months and that was a real change for me	2772	A
um parts do we uh we were over in the- in the western edge in the mountains	2772	A
and they have of course some pretty severe	2772	A
storms uh winter storms snow and that type of thing	2772	A
but they're so good about clearing the roads that you know it doesn't usually bother you very much	2772	A
yeah and and their springs and summers are pretty mild too it never gets real real hot there	2772	A
uh-huh	2772	A
yeah	2772	A
um-hum	2772	A
well funny as we were talking the weather came on and there's a flash flood watch and	2772	A
more rain for the next three or four days	2772	A
yeah maybe we can send you some	2772	A
i think that'll do it	2772	A
well i enjoyed talking with you Lisa	2772	A
uh-huh you too	2772	A
bye bye	2772	A
okay well i can go ahead and start and tell you mine um we're from San Antonio and that's where i grew up so i was used to the heat and out here right now um gosh it gets to about seventies high seventies and it gets very cold at night	2772	B
and Monterey sits um right on the coast	2772	B
and i don't know if your familiar with the um the California coastline but we're we're about two hours about a two hour drive south of San Francisco	2772	B
and it's uh really nice uh it's a big area for people to come from the different uh countries mostly like Japan and Germany and England and they usually go to Carmel	2772	B
and vacation on the beaches so it's it's pretty nice uh year round but um cool always cool in the evenings and uh warm in the warm in the summer but it's stays pretty cool even even uh during the winter for as nice as it is	2772	B
and um we usually get a fog uh right about oh i guess about four o'clock and it kind of rolls in over the coast	2772	B
and uh then it usually breaks back off again uh the next morning and if you go just a little bit ways in i'd i'd say about a fifteen minute drive in towards Salinas	2772	B
uh it the weather completely changes and it gets very hot and dry and uh the fog never makes it that far but along here it's uh very very uh different from the the Texas type uh weather	2772	B
so what's it like down there	2772	B
uh-huh	2772	B
oh well that's good	2772	B
uh-huh	2772	B
have y'all been having any heat waves or	2772	B
like the ninety degree	2772	B
uh-huh	2772	B
uh-huh oh well that's good for this time of year	2772	B
uh-huh	2772	B
uh-huh oh	2772	B
do y'all have many bluebonnets and stuff up there	2772	B
oh i bet	2772	B
uh-huh	2772	B
oh i miss- i miss that	2772	B
oh	2772	B
yeah	2772	B
well that's real nice because i can remember um two years ago that in about February the hundred degree weather started in San Antonio and just continued	2772	B
so at least y'all are getting some rain up in Dallas i'm glad to hear that	2772	B
uh-huh	2772	B
y'all weren't getting any of the strings of uh the tornadoes and stuff were you	2772	B
uh-huh oh okay	2772	B
oh gosh	2772	B
uh-huh	2772	B
oh yeah i really don't miss all the heat here it's i'm getting acclimated to having the cool evenings so we get a bit of a relief	2772	B
uh-huh yeah	2772	B
oh is that what Dallas is okay yeah	2772	B
uh-huh	2772	B
um-hum yeah San Antonio has that same problem when the rains come it's complete- it's a complete mess everything floods all the under passes so i didn't realize that Dallas had that same problem	2772	B
huh golly well we could use some rain up here we're like in the bottom of the fourth year of drought	2772	B
up here and they they had a pretty good early spring and we got quite a bit of rain but it wasn't enough to offset what they had lost over the past four years	2772	B
and uh so they're still talking water rationing this summer	2772	B
so uh it would seem strange because in San Antonio um we had lived out um west of San Antonio in Castroville	2772	B
and the water in Medina Lake and that area was really going down and they were considering um	2772	B
that they might have to do water rationing and then i thought oh gee i'm so glad to get out of there and get up here to the the California Pacific coast where it rains and everything has flowers and there's no problem with water and then i came here and found out they were in	2772	B
you know in the four year drought so i said well gee this is pretty much like Texas and it pretty much is in the middle of the summer they have rolling hills around here but	2772	B
um they they turn to to golden dead grass for the majority of the summer just because there is no water to keep them green	2772	B
but um it's a really nice area uh	2772	B
it's just it's just such a change uh from Texas because i had grown up with uh the heat and and was used to essentially like you said yeah you have the cold winter and then you have the hot	2772	B
summer spring and uh to come here it's kind of the the temperate weather all year round it's kind of like um spring i guess if you uh year round	2772	B
except and then in the the winter and then it seems sort of like a San Antonio um early winter or fall year round so it seems like we only have two springs which is or two seasons and that would be spring and fall and we never really get any of the other ones	2772	B
but it is it's a really nice uh change of pace	2772	B
yeah to the to the heat i really don't miss the heat um we do a lot of you know when you do a lot of outside like running and stuff out	2772	B
it's just so much easier up here and you don't have to worry about the high- high humidity does Dallas get high humidity	2772	B
or is it pretty dry	2772	B
uh-huh	2772	B
yeah it seems like San Antonio has been increasing in humidity over the years because i had lived in San Antonio for about twenty years	2772	B
and it just seemed like every year it just got a little more humid a little more humid and here it's uh well it's right by the ocean but um it's not the same as at Corpus -at Corpus you you get that humid salty	2772	B
feeling in the air but here um the well the water is extremely cold up here you can lay on the beach all you want but um to go if you want to go wind suffering or diving or swimming you have to wear a wet suit	2772	B
and a thick wet suit at that because it's just extremely cold and i for some reason i guess it's because of that cold uh ocean	2772	B
uh water that the the air is always cool it's never humid or sticky or salty feeling so i really like that about this area	2772	B
and uh we just hadn't expected it we were used to what uh uh gulf coast uh weather was like and we came here to Pacific coast weather it's just completely different and it's much nicer	2772	B
so	2772	B
uh-huh it does and the um the air doesn't feel anything like it does along the gulf coast region but um but we like it so it's a nice change so we'll be here a couple of years and we thought well we'll take advantage of it and and see what all the Pacific coast is like	2772	B
and uh so it's been good	2772	B
oh i imagine that Virginia i imagine gets really humid doesn't it	2772	B
oh	2772	B
uh-huh	2772	B
uh-huh	2772	B
uh-huh yeah not like Texas where everything comes to a stand still you know uh	2772	B
uh-huh oh yeah- i'll have to try that out because_1 i had heard that North Carolina was sort of like that	2772	B
and uh i've just never really been in that region of the country and i guess i'm going to have to try that area sometime and see what it's like because a lot of people that are from that North Carolina region really like it	2772	B
and uh they like they get the snow but they said it doesn't really get messy and it doesn't really hang around that long and	2772	B
uh they the- the people i know that are from there uh	2772	B
they always miss it and they want to go back nothing seems quite as good yeah but anyway	2772	B
well	2772	B
oh gee whiz	2772	B
oh gosh oh well i hope it moves up this way but i'm sure it won't	2772	B
yeah because_1 we could sure use it	2772	B
okay well you think that takes care of the the time and	2772	B
okay well i sure appreciate hearing how things are going in Texas and uh	2772	B
yeah good luck to you okay we'll see you um bye	2772	B
the Latin American situation it the last development i know of was the military and financial assistance Columbia for the for the drug uh control	2753	A
and i support that fully i'm not sure we have the right solution to it	2753	A
but at least we're we're going to the source of the problem	2753	A
and uh the source of supply the problem is here but the source of supply is there	2753	A
in fact i think a lot of the i've been to uh Peru several times i've never made it to other parts of South America but uh i have been to Peru and they need some assistance down there	2753	A
and i'm sure that uh as an undeveloped country they look look for it but there is not exactly a lot of uh physical responsibility there	2753	A
yes right	2753	A
and i i think that uh they need guidance and assistance but they need to learn how to stand on their own own two feet also	2753	A
um-hum	2753	A
oh no the and the poor are extremely poor i know i know uh in some of the areas in in Texas seem poor but until you've seen some of those	2753	A
uh native Latin Americans come down from the hills you can't imagine what poor is and uh the worst scene i've ever had i think was uh	2753	A
someone eating out of out of a garbage can on the streets in Lima Peru	2753	A
oh yes yes	2753	A
um-hum	2753	A
oh the there's a joke the the graft and the uh payoffs down there are are an accepted way and in a way and there's a sad joke i guess all jokes are really sad but there's a joke about the uh	2753	A
ambassador from Latin America that came to visit a senator in the US	2753	A
and was taken to his home for dinner and the uh	2753	A
home was palatial and- they had five or six servants you know and and a lot of expensive uh holdings and all that and the ambassador said but i know what you make as a US senator how can you afford all of this	2753	A
and he said come i'll show you and he walked out in the backyard and the uh senator said do you see that hospital over there and the ambassador said yes and he patted his pocket and he said fifteen percent	2753	A
he said you see that school over there and the ambassador said yes and he patted his pocket and he said fifteen percent	2753	A
so so the next year the senator went to Latin America to visit the ambassador and was treated to dinner in his home and it was twice as large and four times as many servants	2753	A
he said well i know how poor your country is how can you afford this uh in such a poor country and he he said come i'll show you and he walked out in the backyard	2753	A
yes yes but it uh it is a problem	2753	A
um-hum	2753	A
um	2753	A
yeah	2753	A
um-hum	2753	A
well the other- the other instance i think of their inability to to handle things the cholera and hepatitis epidemics now in in Latin America	2753	A
and it shows the the unpreparedness for such such a problem and yet they're so	2753	A
yeah and they're they're so rich in resources there they're very rich in oil and and gas and they're very rich in gold and silver	2753	A
and very rich in in uh natural resources such as the fish and uh	2753	A
timber and and copper and all types of uh resources but they yes and but they don't have it's sort of like Russia they don't have the ability to develop it	2753	A
right	2753	A
and they've they're very	2753	A
you're exactly- you're exactly right um-hum it it's sort of illustrated by the uh World Bank and International Monetary Fund not	2753	A
wanting to continue to do business there because they offer assistance then don't get repaid	2753	A
so it's sort of a thumbing of the nose uh approach they need it and they need to uh live up to certain regulations and and expectations but uh	2753	A
then don't and course it's a very volatile government uh situation too	2753	A
um-hum	2753	A
you know	2753	A
um-hum	2753	A
well the	2753	A
the solution discussed at one time and i think it has real merit on the drug situation is that the government- the US government	2753	A
could spend less money	2753	A
by buying the crop and destroying it than they are in trying to to beef up the military and to do all other things i think it'd be cheaper to buy it and destroy it	2753	A
which would still give the uh	2753	A
the grower in Columbia and elsewhere in Latin America	2753	A
the uh the money that they apparently need and go go to the illegal crop for	2753	A
and it would save the US money in	2753	A
in- in the long run how much they're trying to do	2753	A
true	2753	A
no no and and	2753	A
i i think finding an alternate to that would be very good	2753	A
right um-hum	2753	A
Argentine beef yeah yeah	2753	A
well have we come up with a solution yet Salina	2753	A
yeah yes well one of these days uh i hope we'll find some some way to substitute uh good crops for illegal ones	2753	A
i agree	2753	A
yes it has	2753	A
very good	2753	A
um-hum	2753	B
um-hum	2753	B
that's true very definitely so	2753	B
uh-huh	2753	B
i agree i think that for so long	2753	B
power financially uh governmentally every which way was in the hands of such a few	2753	B
that	2753	B
there's not the middle class that we we perceive	2753	B
are extremely poor that's correct	2753	B
um-hum	2753	B
oh and just very happy to get that	2753	B
i have a brother who spent two years in Bolivia and this is very much his you know reaction that the rich are so rich and the poor are so poor	2753	B
um-hum um-hum	2753	B
yep intentions intentions	2753	B
i know um i have a sister-in-law who is from Nicaragua and her family her father was a fairly uh high ranking official under Somoza	2753	B
and when that went down the tubes they had to get out and seventeen children filtered through into	2753	B
into America through Guatemala through Mexico through Honduras	2753	B
you know two here three there one here you know this kind of thing until and now um couple of the older ones stayed	2753	B
or went back but the rest of them now have their American citizenship and are are leading productive lives but	2753	B
you know-	2753	B
yes	2753	B
yes oh the stories she tells you know are just	2753	B
unnerving just unnerving	2753	B
um-hum um-hum	2753	B
and the uranium	2753	B
and the technology	2753	B
well and you know they're very willing to be taught in many cases now too but you know there's just always this kind of resentment underlying i think that when they	2753	B
receive	2753	B
help from us	2753	B
catch twenty two	2753	B
yeah yeah	2753	B
well and i think that you know uh it somewhat a sarcastic view but i'm sure that some of those drugs czars	2753	B
you know they they know that by pumping that poison into our system	2753	B
that that's the way to bring us to our knees more on their level you know that's really uh kind of a far fetched idea i know and i don't think people probably say or think those things consciously but	2753	B
in the long run	2753	B
course then could you know at at some point could you ever convince someone to turn around and grow something that was productive for humankind	2753	B
you know	2753	B
i mean even their even their legal crops are things that we don't perceive as being healthy now from a medical standpoint of view coffee tobacco you know	2753	B
they're certainly legal at- but they're certainly not healthy	2753	B
no not that i know of but it's been fun hashing about it i suppose at any rate yeah	2753	B
well let's just hope that the powers that be uh have time to	2753	B
a little bit once in a while to to think in some farther reaching avenues than you and i do here tonight but	2753	B
well it's been nice chatting with you i appreciate it and and tell your wife i hope we i get her again sometime too this was fun it's kind of nice to to see old friends now you see bye now	2753	B
uh so- i uh weight train uh three days on and one day off	2724	A
i uh ride bicycles um fifteen twenty miles	2724	A
i don't know maybe three times maybe four times a week i play basketball uh couple times a week i play softball one night a week	2724	A
uh that's what i do what about yourself	2724	A
uh-huh	2724	A
oh really	2724	A
yeah what- um what do you ride uh like bunch of hills or flat- pretty flat	2724	A
how long does that take you to get to work	2724	A
how does- how does that work work out with uh storing your bike and showering and all that	2724	A
uh-huh	2724	A
right	2724	A
yeah do you ride a lot of rallies are lot of those around there	2724	A
uh-huh	2724	A
uh well actually my wife just got me into it and i did a did an internship at the Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas at Cooper Clinic and i learned all the health benefits of	2724	A
i you know i was a solid weight trainer and all i did was weights and anaerobic exercise and then my wife got me into the aerobic exercise said you really need to do it so	2724	A
once i got into this uh internship i learned all the physiological advantages- advantages-	2724	A
advantages to it so i began a program couple i don't know probably three or four weeks ago and i did my first bike rally this Saturday i did uh forty forty miles	2724	A
and uh that's the longest i've ever ridden so far i usually you know fifteen or twenty and it was- it was kind of hilly and it was pretty tough but	2724	A
uh i'm looking at uh doing a lot more of it because_1 you know my wife is really into it and i i kind of	2724	A
held her back a little bit this this weekend she wanted to go go go but you know she wanted to stay with me	2724	A
yeah it really is	2724	A
yeah that'd be cool sometime if i could you know work up to that	2724	A
oh	2724	A
i've never really looked into that that you know that's my wife would just love that and i may do that sometime there again i'm just kind of a fledgling into this	2724	A
i've it's kind of funny i'd called this number and i just reading through a a bicycle magazine and going through all the different tours coming up i mean around Texas you got-	2724	A
you got about five or six different- if you live around the Dallas area you got five or six every weekend to choose from because_1 they're really into it	2724	A
bicycling's really big here i didn't know that and you know till i came down here and just kind of caught the fever because_1 i lived in Indiana all my life and	2724	A
you know you may say one- see one or two guys on a bicycle that are above the age of fifteen or something but other than that it's nothing up there like it is down here	2724	A
probably	2724	A
yeah	2724	A
yeah and there's a lot of bikers around here it's it's really neat	2724	A
there are a lot of a lot of resources lot of magazines and stuff little Texas Bicyclist is like a newspaper that comes out every month	2724	A
and it's free you just go to the bike shop bike- bike shop and pick it up and it's got all the rides coming up so i guess i'm gonna be busy about every Saturday this summer going to a different ride yeah see a little bit of Texas i've never seen before	2724	A
so uh how long have you been biking	2724	A
yeah	2724	A
have you ever had a uh it's kind of slightly off the subject but you ever had a uh a blood work up done recently or since you been biking to see if it because_1 it really	2724	A
from what i understand it really improves your uh cholesterol and and you know it uh it kind of knocks you down two uh the big risk categories for coronary artery disease which is uh	2724	A
uh low cardiovascular fitness and also uh you know the cholesterol it gives you uh increased HDLs and decreases your LDLs yeah so	2724	A
yeah	2724	A
really that's good	2724	A
you say you ride about a hundred hundred fifty miles a week man that's that's hard core when do you get to begin with the winters and all that	2724	A
or what time of the year do you usually embark on your do you ride inside if you can't ride outside	2724	A
yeah	2724	A
hm	2724	A
uh-huh	2724	A
yeah	2724	A
right	2724	A
so you uh change up your routes a lot and keep a	2724	A
so what school is it	2724	A
oh okay	2724	A
yeah	2724	A
yeah	2724	A
yeah -that's true sounds neat it's kind of i was wondering if i was gonna	2724	A
talk with someone that never -has exercised before and doesn't want to and everything else but got a guy that rides a hundred and fifty miles a week that's something- motivating	2724	A
-that's really good	2724	A
well	2724	A
uh so what do you do to exercise	2724	B
um-hum	2724	B
hm	2724	B
hm that's pretty impressive um i guess i bicycle uh the amount varies as much as a hundred fifty miles a week um	2724	B
i guess i play softball one night a week and i backpack a lot over the summer	2724	B
yeah -that's that's about the extent of it i mean i don't do any of those things particularly you know for exercise	2724	B
but um i guess the bicycling is the one thing i'll sort of like do if i feel like i need to go exercise um but i do it mostly for fun	2724	B
it it it varies uh out near my house is pretty hilly um but sometimes i bike to work which is about um a fifteen mile trip each way and that's mostly flat	2724	B
about forty five fifty minutes	2724	B
yeah it can be a pain um	2724	B
basically uh i work on a campus so i can store my bike in my office and walk across the uh campus to the uh gym use the shower there uh but it's it's enough of a pain that	2724	B
i did it consistently one year i would commute everyday um	2724	B
but it just became such a pain i mean we were talking you know forty five or fifty minutes for biking um and sometimes longer if you had adverse wind	2724	B
and then another half an hour you know to cool down and take a shower and all this kind of stuff it was a big hunk of- well- hunk of the day um and then of course another hour to get back home um	2724	B
so i've been doing that less and and concentrating more on you know light biking when i get home on the evening and then you know some more on the weekends	2724	B
not so much um	2724	B
i guess mostly i bike on my own i've got a touring bike	2724	B
um though i haven't gone on any extended trips with it how about_1 you what kind of biking do you do	2724	B
um-hum	2724	B
um-hum	2724	B
um-hum	2724	B
hm	2724	B
um-hum	2724	B
oh i see	2724	B
um-hum	2724	B
it's good to have a partner	2724	B
are you you thinking of doing any like centuries or	2724	B
um-hum yeah i just wondered if you're were gonna do that mostly or more like you know uh um	2724	B
uh touring like from Vermont or you know that kind of thing i mean people seem to get into different aspects one is more of a distance and one's more just you know they wanna	2724	B
put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour	2724	B
um-hum	2724	B
um-hum	2724	B
yeah yeah	2724	B
oh that's nice	2724	B
hm	2724	B
wow yeah	2724	B
um-hum	2724	B
yeah i'm not sure why that is i mean generally in the midwest it seems to be less much less i mean maybe it's because_1 of the winters	2724	B
uh or maybe just because you know there's there's a lot more flat lands you know out in the west so it makes biking a better alternative for transportation	2724	B
um-hum	2724	B
hm	2724	B
oh that's terrific	2724	B
um-hum	2724	B
oh i guess	2724	B
as an adult for just about the past uh three years or so	2724	B
um	2724	B
you know i guess the last time i did it before that was college which was about ten years ago and uh yeah i guess i just never really thought about it much for a while um	2724	B
until i suddenly discovered all my friends were basically biking a lot and so i thought i'd try it too	2724	B
no i haven't no	2724	B
hm	2724	B
um-hum	2724	B
oh that's great yeah i've i've definitely noticed it's had a good effect on my pulse rate my resting pulse you know it gets it down to about forty yeah	2724	B
yeah	2724	B
yeah	2724	B
on average yeah	2724	B
no i'm not that hard-core i mean there are some people in fact there are a lot of people who'll ride outside in the snow they've got a uh mountain bike you know with the big knobby tires	2724	B
and i don't do that i basically i i pretty much lay off for the winter uh-hum i was thinking of getting rollers for the last winter you know because_1 it'll help your balance when you're indoor training	2724	B
um but- but i just you know more or less stuck to like an exercise bike and that kind of thing um	2724	B
but yeah i mean winters are kind of a problem so i'm more or less out of shape now that i've been biking i guess this year for just a couple of weeks	2724	B
but yeah it's it's it's it's pretty good it's uh the main	2724	B
oh yeah yeah i try to go someplace pretty different you know every week i rotate around um about four different routes	2724	B
um from my house or i'll sometimes come in to school it's nice coming it's nice- it's nice riding to school because- it's all along a canal path	2724	B
um because_1 it's just it's along the Erie Canal up here uh University of Rochester	2724	B
so that's fairly picturesque and uh so it's it's it's a good ride as long as you're not doing it everyday it's a good ride	2724	B
yeah	2724	B
yeah	2724	B
well it was good talking to you	2724	B
okay you too	2724	B
bye	2724	B
um i don't think that the parents back the teachers enough any more like with discipline and and such and i think that the um because of that the teachers are starting to lose	2720	B
oh i don't know lose interest like you know before like they would really try and help you i think and i can see the difference from when i was in high school and my little brothers and sisters are in it now	2720	B
where the teachers like they can't discipline you whenever you are you know so they just don't even care any more	2720	B
um-hum	2720	B
um-hum	2720	B
oh that's not good	2720	B
oh you know and that's really bad because that's really hurting them in the long run because up here at college now um we are so far behind the foreign students	2720	B
they are so far more advanced than we are and a lot of them even know their English grammar better than i do and they can't speak it as well but i mean to write it is probably better than the way i write it	2720	B
um-hum	2720	B
um-hum yeah	2720	B
um-hum	2720	B
yes i did	2720	B
uh-huh	2720	B
okay yeah we had um college advanced courses and if you were going to college you could take them or if you didn't want to go to college you didn't have to take them but they were optional- you know they were there if anyone wanted to take them just because you were going	2720	B
if you if you wanted to take them and you weren't going to college you still could they didn't limit it to just the people who wanted to college could take them um our math i think we were very strong in our math we were taking tests and our math	2720	B
was um placing like third and fourth in like the nation where you had to send them in	2720	B
and our and our you know for our level and stuff like that you know they had the placing we're placing third or fourth but our English i feel was way below	2720	B
i don't know if i'm just more math oriented but like even on my SAT's i scored two hundred more points on my math than i did in my English and to have that big of a spread is unreal	2720	B
um-hum	2720	B
um-hum	2720	B
really	2720	B
um-hum	2720	B
i don't think they are	2720	B
um-hum	2720	B
i'm very disappointed with professors at college they're only required to be in their office five hours out of the entire week	2720	B
some of them only have two or three classes	2720	B
and at the most they probably spend five hours in their classes and five hours that they're required to be in their office that's ten hours a week they're probably making more	2720	B
i know they're making more than my father and he you know he's making like forty five thousand and a lot of them have like other part like i know a lot of the business majors and computer	2720	B
professors they have other jobs like some of them may be accountants and they do accounting you know and this is just to me it seems like it's a hobby to them and i don't and i've even expressed to some of my professors i don't think it's right	2720	B
as i think they should be spending more time and too they they teach the same class year after year well i know one professor he comes up from Pittsburgh you know and he hasn't changed his tests	2720	B
or even his you know presenting material in years you can get the notes off someone else and never go to class and just go for your midterm and final and as long as you study those notes from two years ago you're still going to do fine in his class	2720	B
and i- i- i don't think it i don't think it's right at all just like you're not even teaching any more you don't care you're getting paid whether we show up or not i mean uh i- i just i'm very disappointed with the	2720	B
yeah uh-huh yeah he just has the same outlines year after year	2720	B
i- i don't know because you know we fill out a student evaluation form every semester you fill one out on your professors and i know	2720	B
me and along with other students we we have the same complaints year after year and nothing seems to be getting done so i don't know if they even	2720	B
it's supposed to one's supposed to go to the professor himself and um another is supposed to go to like the administration	2720	B
i don't know if they're just doing it to satisfy the students so they think that we're doing something	2720	B
or they're usually- really using it but i know we complain about the same thing year after year you know	2720	B
no	2720	B
um what about it	2720	B
oh well you know they've even done stuff like that our teachers are now telling us that these do you know apply they please fill them out properly you know we are really are using them they tell us that but we don't see any you know	2720	B
i have no clue what you mean i don't know what else we can do	2720	B
um-hum	2720	B
yeah my high school had a walk out two years ago	2720	B
okay Michelle um could you give me a few ideas on what you think is wrong with our public school system	2720	A
yeah i'm not sure if that's if that's a condition of of the lack of interest of the parents or if that's a condition of the	2720	A
administrators in the school systems	2720	A
um i've got a brother-in-law that was was teaching in Connecticut down by the Navy base and they have a a a	2720	A
fairly a transient population you know they're um only stationed there for a short period of time so	2720	A
most of the kids never get to finish high school uh there one or two years and then they have to be they're shipped off some place else and he teaches uh he teaches English and he teaches uh shop	2720	A
and it got to a point where he said that the administrators were coming to him just about every year having him downgrade his English exams because too many students were failing them	2720	A
yeah so in that particular school system um that was that was one of the problems and	2720	A
i guess one of the reasons the administrators uh were were putting so much pressure on him was uh the parents were going to them saying you know my Johnny or my Mary is smarter than that and blah blah blah and they can't fail and so	2720	A
that's right	2720	A
um yeah because they uh they care it's something that they want to learn um	2720	A
i'm sure you're you're more uh fluent in other things the things that you're interested in than some other people too uh	2720	A
i've been out of school for a long time so you know when i went to school i it was in a rural area and they had like two grades in the same class	2720	A
so when you're i think it was uh first and second third and fourth were in the same classroom so when you went through the first grade	2720	A
and you graduated you went to the second grade you just moved to the second half of the class on the other side of the room i found looking back at it now that	2720	A
when i was in the second grade i knew just about everything that was there i had learned it from the first grade and the same thing with the fourth i had learned it so it's the amount of teaching you get i think uh	2720	A
um you're like a sponge when you're young you absorb just about everything that they can throw at you	2720	A
um	2720	A
today	2720	A
well you're you're closer to it now than i am um	2720	A
did you go to high school in Pennsylvania	2720	A
okay so that's you're you're native then	2720	A
to Pennsylvania so how was your high school did they have with the split out like some people were going to college so they took certain courses and some people were shop	2720	A
okay	2720	A
okay	2720	A
oh that was good yeah	2720	A
yeah	2720	A
yeah um	2720	A
and we were just the opposite up here um i took the same algebra class two years in a row same book same teacher and that's only because of our school system but as far as English um	2720	A
we had a professor that taught English which was very unusual for our school system so our English was	2720	A
probably better than	2720	A
than most of the other school systems in in the state	2720	A
um	2720	A
up here now we're finding that more and more parents of are pulling their children out of the school systems and they are tutoring them at home	2720	A
yeah i work with uh a couple of the people that i i work with you know share the same office are doing that they've pulled their children out and they get a much rounder education	2720	A
um and why that is i don't know i think it's too much administration at the top	2720	A
also i don't know the level of the teachers today are they dedicated like they used to be years ago or is it just a it's just a job so they can get the summers off	2720	A
how about college	2720	A
hum	2720	A
that's incredible that's incredible-	2720	A
so when he files his lesson plans for the year he just he just drags out the old ones and just files them and nobody even looks at them and all that is fine and	2720	A
so he's getting away with it so is it is it his fault or is it his boss	2720	A
or the people that he has to respond to report to	2720	A
and who does that	2720	A
who does that go to though who does that evaluation form	2720	A
that's what it sounds like	2720	A
do they do they ever publish any results um	2720	A
how about the student newspaper	2720	A
would it be wise to put an article in there say you know we're doing these evaluations and every year we're we're making the same evaluations but yet the administration's not looking at the evaluations	2720	A
yeah	2720	A
what do you think uh can be done	2720	A
as far as um well one other's things probably is i don't know if it happens down there but every time the contracts teachers' contracts come up it's just before school season starts and they all go on strike	2720	A
so they close the schools down until they get what they want	2720	A
what's the matter with the uh students doing the same thing say hey uh we're we want a quality education and we're not getting it let's go on strike you know then see what you're going to do it'll create a lot of headlines that's for sure	2720	A
all right	2706	A
oh uh ever since they really got started	2706	A
uh maybe a phone call a week or something like that	2706	A
i guess so	2706	A
i'm with a electronics company	2706	A
uh	2706	A
i've been an engineer all my life and uh	2706	A
that's one of the the issues that i have with the company that uh you know salary is is one benefit but uh i feel as an engineer that uh	2706	A
you know i take pride in my work and uh getting credit for that and recognition for the work that you do and uh having challenging work uh doing challenging assignments is one of the one of the payments that you get for your time	2706	A
i think our benefits package is pretty fair at the company	2706	A
but uh you know it's uh sometimes quite a struggle to uh to do work that's challenging and find challenging assignments	2706	A
i feel that one of the things that happens in this country is that uh you know engineers become what i call clerical engineers they spend their time pushing paper and doing mundane tasks that could be assigned to uh to other people	2706	A
i'm uh fifty four	2706	A
um-hum	2706	A
um-hum	2706	A
yeah	2706	A
um-hum	2706	A
yeah	2706	A
um-hum	2706	A
um-hum	2706	A
um-hum	2706	A
yes i think so	2706	A
i've been there thirty two years	2706	A
yeah	2706	A
well after being there for this long i get uh four weeks a year and i have an option to uh trade salary for an extra week	2706	A
uh let me see how does it work uh after you get two weeks up until five years and then you get an additional day uh each year thereafter up until ten years	2706	A
and then thereafter every other year you get an additional day so by the time you've been there twenty years you get the four weeks	2706	A
hum okay	2706	A
none no carryover whatsoever	2706	A
right	2706	A
um-hum	2706	A
right	2706	A
um-hum	2706	A
yeah	2706	A
um	2706	A
that's right	2706	A
now we're allowed to accrue sick leave but uh	2706	A
hum okay	2706	A
yes we do	2706	A
hum	2706	A
you mean uh mean holidays	2706	A
uh	2706	A
i don't know the exact count uh they took away some of the minor holidays a few years back and we get Christmas week off	2706	A
so yeah we traded in Veterans Day and uh	2706	A
and i guess Good Friday or something like that uh in favor of having a week off at Christmas i i'm not too enthusiastic about taking a vacation at Christmas time because_1	2706	A
yeah	2706	A
um-hum	2706	A
well i think that's the reason our plant went that way what we we have uh a lot of uh government contract work and we find that in that last uh couple of week of the year all the government people are use it or lose it situation	2706	A
yeah	2706	A
um-hum	2706	A
oh okay	2706	A
yeah	2706	A
huh that's strange	2706	A
huh	2706	A
yeah we're sort of in that situation we do get uh uh George Washington's birthday but it's still a long dry stretch from then until uh Memorial Day	2706	A
uh i'm kind of cross with it this year we changed uh uh managers for the plan we had been with Blue Cross and Blue Shield and uh we got to know them pretty well and how to work with the system	2706	A
but they've gone to a managed care program and we had to even- even though we were right in the middle of the area we had to opt out because there are no physicians in the area that are taking patients	2706	A
and it's absolutely pathetic up here uh so far the insurance company owes us about two thousand dollars and the checks are not coming in	2706	A
yeah that's the way our company works	2706	A
uh-huh	2706	A
yeah	2706	A
yeah our in our area they all turned it down they say forget it uh if this patient wants to wants to go somewhere else let him go there	2706	A
Texas how you doing	2706	B
good good good have you been participating in this uh program very much	2706	B
oh okay	2706	B
uh okay Bill you about_1 ready to get started	2706	B
uh Bill what kind of a company you with	2706	B
oh okay	2706	B
right uh do do you think the benefits package is fair	2706	B
um-hum	2706	B
yeah	2706	B
yeah you sound like you sound like my own situation uh how- how old are you Bill	2706	B
oh hey i'm fifty seven sounds like same situation here	2706	B
uh i'm with TI of course and our our benefits it it's interesting uh because that's one of the biggest gripes in the company is the benefits whether it be the health insurance or or the food or or other things	2706	B
uh however recently i've had a chance to sample the outside and uh probably by industry standards we're probably in the top seventy percent	2706	B
uh the uh uh i've i've really in fact what i'm doing is i'm uh retiring effective Tuesday and going with another company	2706	B
uh primarily for some of the things that you stated uh i've spent uh eight of my last ten years in offshore sites in Asia	2706	B
and i've just had a real ball	2706	B
and uh since i've been back part of my job is is trouble shooting into the offshore site plants which is okay but the other part the other part's pushing paper	2706	B
and uh uh which i don't like i got the opportunity to go with another company in fact uh a uh a semiconductor uh uh assembly house that supplies us uh where the uh where the job will be a hundred percent going into their various plants trouble shooting	2706	B
and and i'm going to do that beginning the first of May	2706	B
but uh uh interestingly- interestingly- interestingly enough though uh the the biggest grind i've been with i've been with TI thirty two years	2706	B
uh the biggest gripe in TI is the benefits package but as i go looking at other companies as i've i've had a chance to do uh it's really not all that bad	2706	B
uh that the one of the biggest gripes of the benefit package is the insurance program and i guess they've all fallen victim to the high rising costs of medical care	2706	B
and and i- i think that's the type of thing that uh uh that it that it amounts to uh what kind of vacation policy how long have you been with your company Bill	2706	B
thirty two ha ha sounds familiar what kind of vacation uh uh restrictions do you have or or shouldn't say restrictions policy	2706	B
oh neat neat neat uh when when did you get into the uh uh when did you go through the break where you started getting four weeks	2706	B
um-hum	2706	B
um-hum	2706	B
you get a full four weeks yeah yeah we get two weeks after a year uh uh three three- three weeks between five and fifteen and four weeks over fifteen	2706	B
and uh uh are you allowed to how many days are you allowed to accrue	2706	B
oh so you have to flush it out at the end of every year or or you lose it	2706	B
okay well we've got we're allowed to accrue a fair bunch i'm not exactly sure uh on a year to year basis what it is because i accrued most of mine before they put in the restrictions uh and then they they grandfathered our old days	2706	B
uh but what it what it uh the bottom line is that when you die retire or quit the most you can get paid for is seventy days	2706	B
which is fourteen weeks which is which is a pretty nice little bonus so i think with with retiring here in the next three days	2706	B
uh i have eighty five days vacation and and it would have been nice to been able to use up fifteen of them in April but i had so many things i had to do before i finished i didn't get to do that so i'm in essence going to be giving those back to the company or most of them back	2706	B
but at least i get paid for seventy days which in your situation you don't i mean when you go out you probably get just the ones you have in that current year right	2706	B
uh-huh uh-huh that's interesting- interesting	2706	B
oh okay well see we we don't have any any such thing as sick leave uh if you're exempt and you've been here over	2706	B
three years or four years or something like that you can be sick up to six months and still get paid and and and uh uh that uh do you have a uh long and short term disability program	2706	B
yeah and we get half half pay uh or full pay for six months and half pay for the remainder of the disability i guess how it works	2706	B
and uh uh that's interesting how how many vacation days do y'all get	2706	B
yeah i meant holidays yeah	2706	B
oh okay okay so it probably all adds up to the same	2706	B
yeah it	2706	B
yeah yeah	2706	B
no i guess that's true i- i guess see most of us and like yourself where you've got four weeks you can take plenty throughout the year and still have a week even if it weren't a company holiday you'd still have some time left over at Christmas	2706	B
and uh i- i guess what happens is we don't have Christmas week we have Christmas plus a day around Christmas a day before or a day after as official holidays	2706	B
but there's so many people that are so senior and have so much time off so much vacation time coming that you will find virtually no one in the plant	2706	B
yeah probably	2706	B
yeah	2706	B
yeah so they're all gone	2706	B
yeah yeah that's that's what happened to us i think the last the last holiday we got was in the middle uh seventies	2706	B
uh we get we get uh New Years Day Good Friday Memorial Day July Fourth Labor Day uh Thanksgiving and the day after and then Christmas and a day either side of it	2706	B
which which comes out to about nine and uh and and just since i've been here i mean when i got here we didn't even get Memorial Day	2706	B
and it it wasn't recognized here in the deep South	2706	B
and we got uh uh and Good Friday came along i think uh in about nineteen seventy we got a chance to vote on it and we had to vote on on that versus the Friday after Thanksgiving because_1 we didn't get that day then	2706	B
and i always felt that it wasn't a religious motive that gave us Good Friday the the the employees voted for Good Friday it was just that New Years Day to Memorial Day was such a long stretch without a holiday it was nice to put one in there in the spring	2706	B
oh okay so you	2706	B
yeah are are you fairly satisfied with your health insurance	2706	B
yeah	2706	B
oh my goodness	2706	B
my goodness that's tough uh we had uh we've been with Aetna actually i think we find- fund our own insurance program Aetna just administers paying the bills	2706	B
yeah and and and the uh uh they started out with having Managed Mental Health Care	2706	B
and then they went to Managed Hospital Network where you had to go to a network hospital and we just got a notice the other day saying that uh that we're going to have uh uh network doctors	2706	B
and and they're going to the way they're going to work into this is they're going to look at the doctors that have been providing care for people	2706	B
and uh write to them all and tell them_1 that they've got an opportunity to be part of this program and they and	2706	B
no kidding	2706	B
so um you said you don't have kids but um you're interested in the topic	2727	A
uh-huh	2727	A
right	2727	A
yes yes i have one son who's now uh eighteen and he's a sophomore in college	2727	A
and it it does but i was very lucky in that i was um teaching at a university and so basically and lived within walking distance	2727	A
so i was able when he was little just to um leave him with a neighbor in uh one of these carry cots	2727	A
and then go up and teach a class and come back	2727	A
because i could do my work at home and my my students who were working on their master's degrees and stuff would come to my house and i would meet with them there	2727	A
so it was really ideal and then later on um when he was gee maybe two and three i actually took him then i changed to a different school but it was still within walking distance	2727	A
and um he spent a lot of time in my office because_1 i was uh department chairman	2727	A
and um you know really didn't interfere because all his life he had sort of been used to there were quiet times	2727	A
and so and that worked out great	2727	A
yes	2727	A
yes he's commuting it's um about	2727	A
gee he commutes forty five minutes a each way but he has to allow an hour and a half going to school because it's too too chancy for him to miss classes	2727	A
and so actually we don't i mean we still spend a lot of time together in the sense that we are always together for dinner and and	2727	A
um then you know he's in the house studying in the evening	2727	A
and he also works and so um he usually calls me	2727	A
at when he gets home from school at noon i mean not not checking in but more gee you know missed you you know what with this is what's new type of thing and i think we have a very good relationship from that standpoint but i think it's	2727	A
unusual and i think part of it is that that we were abroad for a good part of the time	2727	A
until till um six years ago	2727	A
well i was actually in the Middle East	2727	A
so	2727	A
yeah	2727	A
bilingual yes yeah actually um	2727	A
he he was more in a sense raised trilingual in that i spoke Spanish to him when he was a baby	2727	A
and then but he always answered in Arabic because_1 he heard more Arabic than Spanish	2727	A
and then when we first came to visit my mother he picked up English when he was two and a half	2727	A
and he had heard me talk English on the phone but you know he hadn't he really didn't use it	2727	A
so	2727	A
oh	2727	A
where are you from	2727	A
oh okay	2727	A
um-hum	2727	A
cause you they were newly in this country	2727	A
ah	2727	A
um-hum	2727	A
where were they where they what village	2727	A
oh from Damascus okay	2727	A
oh okay	2727	A
um-hum	2727	A
yeah but see there's a big big issue there because my my family spoke German at home so that we couldn't understand	2727	A
and and my um nieces and nephews are not learning their mother's language	2727	A
so that i think this is a a tendency in the States is because it's a melting pot so i think my son had the advantage of we were actually living outside the country	2727	A
so there was a reason for him to learn it	2727	A
yeah it's really hard	2727	A
well i'm not so sure that it's the the academics as much as spending time with him	2727	A
and i've been concerned in the States since i've been back with the number particularly in the Washington area where i live now	2727	A
um with a seeing how many kids come home to empty houses and like in our court we live in our townhouse court	2727	A
and there's seven year olds that come home and they're locked out	2727	A
and you know some of the neighbors sort of feel sorry- sorry for them_1 and- and	2727	A
you know would be very responsible if something happened but the parents aren't willing to to pay that person to sort of be in charge and and i think this is	2727	A
i you know i've just seen so much of it here in this country that you wouldn't see in in certainly not in the Arab culture i mean	2727	A
people- people are more important than things so	2727	A
he's a terror well he's a terror he just you know climbs on cars walks around the court threatening people with sticks	2727	A
yeah it	2727	A
right now would you continue do you work now	2727	A
oh	2727	A
uh-huh	2727	A
um-hum um-hum	2727	A
right	2727	A
uh-huh	2727	A
um-hum	2727	A
right	2727	A
uh-huh	2727	A
uh-huh	2727	A
right right that you- he'll be able to spend more time which is so important	2727	A
right actually we traveled extensively because i was doing archeology and so	2727	A
you know he was always able to come with me on all my travels because a lot of the places i went by car of course	2727	A
and i mean you know i was living in the middle of it and i took every advantage and and you know he doesn't dislike travel now he might not like it	2727	A
uh you know he might not feel compelled to travel because he has seen a lot but he's very comfortable traveling	2727	A
and so	2727	A
that's right that's right	2727	A
so	2727	A
no	2727	A
no and and and i find that interesting because he's been two years ahead in the schools here	2727	A
and so he always you know was treated like little brother when the band needed transportation they'd say oh he can't drive so	2727	A
you know when he's a senior he can drive some of the the younger kids around type of thing	2727	A
and he didn't- he didn't get his license- i mean he was just sixteen when he graduated from high school so	2727	A
you know he he has friends but he doesn't have any you know he hasn't really gotten into the social thing	2727	A
and he's i think that's all right he's going to it looks like finish his degree first before he gets too involved	2727	A
yeah	2727	A
right	2727	A
that's right	2727	A
but you don't have to keep up i mean kids appreciate it more if you don't	2727	A
i think if if things are special and are for them they see that their kids are being bought	2727	A
that their friends are being bought by their parents	2727	A
uh-huh and they don't need them and they don't even appreciate them	2727	A
i mean that's my feeling i think you know from what i see a lot of people just	2727	A
it's a token you know you don't have me so you have all these material things	2727	A
um-hum	2727	A
oh very good and it sounds like you have good values and	2727	A
well yeah and um actually i'm very interested we are my husband and i are thinking very soon um about having children and i think that i am just um	2727	B
a little bit	2727	B
uh brainwashed or whatever by just thinking that kids are so wonderful and cute and i can't wait to have one and i don't see the real responsibility of it	2727	B
um and an actually how dramatically	2727	B
your life can change when you do have children	2727	B
do you have kids	2727	B
oh	2727	B
oh wow	2727	B
oh	2727	B
um-hum	2727	B
wow	2727	B
um-hum um-hum	2727	B
oh that's great	2727	B
um-hum	2727	B
uh-huh yeah	2727	B
that's wonderful how is it now i imagine you said he's a sophomore	2727	B
so this is is he living at home	2727	B
um-hum	2727	B
but	2727	B
oh really	2727	B
uh-hum	2727	B
um-hum	2727	B
um-hum	2727	B
uh-huh	2727	B
um-hum	2727	B
yeah	2727	B
that's great	2727	B
oh really	2727	B
where what part of Europe	2727	B
oh my goodness	2727	B
oh how nice was he raised bilingual- as a bilingual- was he bilingual yeah	2727	B
oh my goodness	2727	B
um-hum	2727	B
oh my gosh	2727	B
uh-huh	2727	B
that is wonderful boy i i	2727	B
i am Arabic actually my background is um my my grandparents are from Syria	2727	B
and um	2727	B
i wish that my parents had taught me Arabic when i was younger it was really a sort of the taboo language	2727	B
when i was little um you know there was the whole and- and there still is	2727	B
well my parents were born here my grandparents moved here um	2727	B
and then had my parents shortly after they moved here	2727	B
in Damascus	2727	B
um-hum from Damascus all of them actually	2727	B
and um i just i think it's a real shame because now i don't have the patience and i don't have the ability you know at my age to start learning a foreign language	2727	B
but when you're a kid you just pick it up so naturally	2727	B
um-hum	2727	B
oh really	2727	B
uh-huh	2727	B
yeah	2727	B
yeah um-hum	2727	B
that's true	2727	B
yeah do you think that your being in academics um helped your son	2727	B
he sounds like he is very responsible and um you know seems to be concerned about his studies	2727	B
um-hum	2727	B
um-hum	2727	B
oh	2727	B
yeah	2727	B
um-hum	2727	B
oh jeez	2727	B
yeah um-hum	2727	B
uh-huh	2727	B
yeah oh no that for sure	2727	B
and then everyone- wonders why why like you said that seven year old you know why two months from now he's on drugs or something	2727	B
oh really	2727	B
oh jeez	2727	B
oh well he has no discipline i mean no one is there to tell him what's right and what's wrong	2727	B
yes i do i work full time and my husband actually is going for his PhD and uh would like to teach	2727	B
and be a professor um hopefully somewhere in the south i- i i'm from	2727	B
Boston and i i'm fed up with the cold weather really between Boston and Rochester	2727	B
but um ideally i would um i want to have a child and i'd like to be able to be home for a year	2727	B
and i really just selfishly don't want to miss that	2727	B
and um you know my husband's schedule hopefully will be flexible um	2727	B
in that he could do a lot of his work at home	2727	B
and um i'm not sure i i still want to work i think that's very important	2727	B
to keep that up and i don't want to um you know i don't want to go several years without working outside the house	2727	B
but um	2727	B
but i think that him being um a little bit more flexible with his schedule will really help us out a lot	2727	B
so that that's nice thing about teaching	2727	B
right and i imagine that obviously your summers were a lot lighter as far as work load	2727	B
oh	2727	B
oh wow	2727	B
um-hum	2727	B
oh sure	2727	B
um-hum	2727	B
right	2727	B
uh-huh	2727	B
um-hum	2727	B
well he has done more and seen more than most people do in a lifetime it sounds like that's wonderful and it it sounds like he really appreciates it too	2727	B
that's great	2727	B
does he have a girlfriend oh	2727	B
oh wow	2727	B
ah	2727	B
um-hum	2727	B
um-hum	2727	B
uh-huh	2727	B
um-hum	2727	B
um-hum well that's a good idea	2727	B
you know it's it's i would love when i was little i had friends and they had enormous families and i would love to have a large family it seems so expensive though	2727	B
to think about raising a child besides just the the essentials you know clothes and food and this and that	2727	B
i really feel like there's this whole um you know you have to keep up with the Jones or whatever they say and uh you know it just seem like when i you know watch	2727	B
really	2727	B
um-hum	2727	B
yeah	2727	B
well i hope so i mean i look at these toys on TV and i just think oh my God they didn't have those when i was little	2727	B
yeah	2727	B
uh-huh	2727	B
um-hum yeah that's true	2727	B
well it's interesting well i don't know i think i'm ready for it a couple of years we got married a couple of years ago and i thought oh my God i'll never be ready for a kid	2727	B
but i i definitely think i am now	2727	B
yeah	2727	B
well other than the Nicaraguan situation where we kicked out the dictator of that country and his case is yet to come to trial and all that	2771	B
i can't say that i've kept up too much with it i know that the Colombians for awhile	2771	B
we were trying to do something to give them the incentive to get out of the drug trade and there was a lot of assassinations and killings and that sort of thing going on down there	2771	B
because they were trying to clean up the mobster crowd	2771	B
uh but uh other than that uh the only thing i ever hear about a country like Brazil or some place like that is advertisements to come enjoy their their beaches and the like and what is it Rio de Janeiro	2771	B
um-hum	2771	B
um-hum	2771	B
yeah	2771	B
um-hum um-hum	2771	B
yeah that's right	2771	B
yeah i heard about that that's supposed to be kind of sweeping on up through the uh Central American- American countries too	2771	B
um-hum	2771	B
um-hum um-hum	2771	B
and their filtration systems i guess haven't kept up with uh the pace	2771	B
oh	2771	B
oh um um um	2771	B
um-hum um	2771	B
right	2771	B
um-hum	2771	B
um-hum	2771	B
um-hum	2771	B
um-hum um	2771	B
well i don't think uh i- i agree with you i think you're right we have exploited but i- i think that the leadership that Mexico has had up until for some phenomenally lucky reason has been a rather than corrupt	2771	B
um feudalistic type of leadership everybody sort of on the take sort of like the way uh the uh	2771	B
uh what- what was that bunch that used to run the Philippines	2771	B
yeah yeah so that sort of thing and the guy they got in this last time uh he for once is a tried and true and really you know outright capitalist from the word go	2771	B
and he wants to take the government off the peoples backs and really get free enterprise on started	2771	B
and i was reading i think in Newsweek or Time or one of those or US News World Reports one of those {mags} that uh	2771	B
uh	2771	B
they were having a tough time with the peasant farmer situation being able to compete with uh American farming industry because we have these huge conglomerates	2771	B
well he went out using the governments uh	2771	B
uh finances or or whatever you call it he went out and and gathered together a lot of the farmers who had small farms inside one another	2771	B
and he pulled together sort of like a a commune	2771	B
but yet he let's them_1 each be a free enterprise uh uh person but they work together in terms of what they organize to grow	2771	B
and they grow massive amounts of things that are common to each other in certain areas and yet they vary their crops in such a way that they they uh can be very productive in how many- much of these crops they make but they can also roll them_1 over	2771	B
and then they market it altogether as a group as a force	2771	B
and as a result uh it said that uh since they started the program of course it went kind of	2771	B
kind of uh rough at first but apparently since they got the program going that they uh amount of money and the uh	2771	B
uh profit and standard of living that they're able to to reap from it has gone up almost tenfold from this	2771	B
and so uh this guy may be actually going to finely turn the uh the country on i mean it's always been tough for the southern or or lower latitude countries	2771	B
to be as productive as some reason another and as the higher latitude countries	2771	B
i've often wondered if that does have something to do with the the climate being uh so warm that it tends to make work harder to do	2771	B
i don't know	2771	B
but it does seem like that there has always been a preponderance of countries in the middle latitude zones that uh	2771	B
uh seem to always lack in their ability to to develop industrially uh as well as even very well agriculturally	2771	B
i don't know	2771	B
um yeah yeah	2771	B
right	2771	B
um-hum um	2771	B
um-hum	2771	B
yeah and and they have been uh they have had spurts at times i know i think it was uh Chile	2771	B
uh	2771	B
that has been fairly capitalistic	2771	B
that have had spurts of times when they did rather well and then they sort of reverse because they have some sort of a military take over or something like that and they go into a dictatorship for awhile and	2771	B
and it would just sort of uh go downhill	2771	B
but uh uh	2771	B
i don't know that that they don't seem to be able to keep any particular stable regime for any particular long period of time	2771	B
in their capitalistic type governments	2771	B
yeah	2771	B
um-hum	2771	B
yeah unless they have a coffee strike or the drug problem gets out of uh proportion like it did for awhile	2771	B
that's right or or unless they're kicking the British's butts like they did in the Falkland Islands something like that where it involves one of our allies	2771	B
then	2771	B
you're you're right and um	2771	B
i wonder why that is	2771	B
could it possibly be because of they're they're little third world countries and they are all independent from one another where as if they had of somehow or another from their past history formed into a larger country like our continental United States did	2771	B
and uh developed uh uh a free enterprise capitalistic type of economy with a common form of government that they could have uh uh been a force in the world though	2771	B
i don't know i- i- i ask what what went wrong what was different	2771	B
they certainly have the climates in the southern hemisphere uh uh to have been easily as productive and i certainly think they have rich enough land i don't think uh	2771	B
the continental of South America as i recall my geography that's been along time ago as being any particularly uh different or or lacking in terms of agricultural or industrial or river	2771	B
rivers that were naturally there or so forth that they could not have developed- developed a uh	2771	B
a pretty uh uh uh by today's standards modern type of economy	2771	B
yeah	2771	B
um-hum um-hum	2771	B
um-hum um-hum	2771	B
um-hum	2771	B
um-hum	2771	B
i think that's kind of it i mean i certainly don't tend to think about it like out of the site out of mind	2771	B
uh myself uh in general unless there's some sort of a controversial thing going on that either affects me or the country at large one way or the other politically	2771	B
all right	2771	A
you know like you said i haven't uh been keeping track of what all has been going on in uh Central America myself	2771	A
um and uh	2771	A
um-hum	2771	A
yeah	2771	A
yeah yeah yeah i know what your talking about	2771	A
um	2771	A
i've i've listened to a lot of things going on i mean uh the uh Manuel Noriega Panama thing i think was probably the right thing to do i mean the guy was just blatantly going out and shooting Americans	2771	A
and uh so i think what they did there was right	2771	A
i'm not so sure about uh what they're doing in some of the other countries where we're supporting guerillas that are fighting the communists	2771	A
you know regimes that are in there	2771	A
uh because it never seems to really work	2771	A
and we end up throwing in money and a lot of people getting killed and when push comes to shove we seem to back out on the gorillas like we did the Kurds back uh in the late seventies	2771	A
and so that that that kind of thing concerns me um	2771	A
it's the things that we're not doing that we should be doing like right now there's a big outbreak of uh	2771	A
of course it's a little further south in South America but there's an outbreak of uh uh what is it cholera in uh Peru and all so it's uh gotten into Columbia now	2771	A
and it looks like it's going to be a pretty serious uh thing there they're talking about it lasting for ten years	2771	A
yeah and it's it's already gotten into- into Brazil a little bit and it has to do with the fact that uh i mean in that part of the world they just dump raw sewage right into the rivers i mean things that we don't do here anymore because we know how bad it is for you	2771	A
yet they're they're you know they're steadily- steadily doing it down there	2771	A
and it	2771	A
they actually don't have filtration systems uh the some of the major cities do	2771	A
um but for the most part most of those countries they just flat out pump it right into the rivers	2771	A
and let it float on down and pump it right out into the ocean	2771	A
and that's you know that's how they deal with it and you know they're just steadily polluting that part of the part of the world that way	2771	A
um the other thing is the uh economic assistance uh	2771	A
right now we're starting we're starting to talk about having free trade with Mexico	2771	A
and my God this is something we should have done years ago and Mexico is our closest neighbor they've been in financial trouble for years	2771	A
and i think we've exploited them i mean when i was in Texas i noticed that uh you know you think of Texas and you have you know good meat and fresh vegetables and all that	2771	A
well most of the vegetables they sold in Texas came from Mexico and so did the meat	2771	A
the meat that was raised in Texas they sent back east to sell because_1 they get more money for it	2771	A
and uh	2771	A
yeah The Marcos	2771	A
um-hum	2771	A
right	2771	A
um-hum	2771	A
um-hum	2771	A
that's great	2771	A
um-hum	2771	A
yeah yeah that that that probably has some bearing on it	2771	A
um also there's uh a uh tradition of just doing enough to get by	2771	A
they're they're not as uh motivated as uh as as we are and	2771	A
people farther south	2771	A
now you know once you you get down into Chile and Argentina and those kinds of areas i mean their their climates are pretty much the same as ours	2771	A
yeah	2771	A
yeah and while we're sitting here talking about it i'm thinking	2771	A
you know we know every darn thing that goes on everyday in Europe	2771	A
you know i mean we know what's going on in Poland we know what's going on in Romania we know the Germanies are getting back together we didn't you know we know all what's going in Europe	2771	A
but we never here anything about what's going on down in South- you know in South and Central America	2771	A
or unless we're sending thousands of troops down there to kick somebody's butt i mean	2771	A
yeah	2771	A
yeah we just don't pay any attention to them_1	2771	A
yeah it's it's you know it's	2771	A
it just doesn't make any sense i mean we're in the same uh hemisphere so so to speak i mean you know the same side of the earth i mean	2771	A
yeah	2771	A
yeah	2771	A
yeah yeah i mean it doesn't it really doesn't make sense to me	2771	A
i don't you know it's	2771	A
i mean they've never really been a real force in the world i mean uh we heard about Argentina only when it tried to take over the Falcons and England had to go down there and kick their butt	2771	A
um so it's it's like really strange that we never pay that much attention	2771	A
i- i	2771	A
you know i just find myself lacking in in a lot of knowledge about South America	2771	A
i'd like to think i know a lot about a lot of things but	2771	A
you know i have	2771	A
something is amiss here as far as the amount of information that's available	2771	A
uh	2771	A
i don't know if it's intentional on the part of you know the the powers that be or whether no body really cares	2771	A
yes um how how do you feel about uh	2773	A
way the US has reacted in the Middle East	2773	A
um-hum	2773	A
what is the Woodward book you are referring to	2773	A
um-hum	2773	A
um-hum um-hum	2773	A
right that was- that's my feeling i was i was very against our involvement so so quickly and- um uh	2773	A
um-hum um-hum	2773	A
right i think we're very naive as far as that part of the world's concerned	2773	A
right right in spite of all the promises	2773	A
um-hum um-hum	2773	A
um-hum um-hum	2773	A
um-hum	2773	A
and i'm i'm not sure we're sensitive to to other cultures	2773	A
um-hum	2773	A
um-hum but i'm not sure it's something you can teach i mean	2773	A
awareness maybe	2773	A
um-hum um-hum	2773	A
um-hum that's true that's true	2773	A
yeah	2773	A
right and um what about the whole situation with with the refugees	2773	A
the Kurds	2773	A
um but what about the Palestinians then	2773	A
right	2773	A
um-hum um-hum	2773	A
um-hum	2773	A
um-hum well do you think the US should even be involved i mean as as the world leader in the sense trying to resolve the issues or should we have just stayed out of it	2773	A
um-hum	2773	A
um-hum um	2773	A
right right	2773	A
um-hum um	2773	A
um-hum um-hum	2773	A
um-hum um-hum	2773	A
right but but in a sense i don't know that i- i that i would say it's good but in i'm sense- in a sense i'm glad that Saudi wasn't more changed by by the situation because i mean we really don't	2773	A
i mean i don't think it's our role to westernize the whole world so the fact that that Saudi could just sort of pull back and and and remain you know culturally sort of clean is is interesting	2773	A
um-hum	2773	A
right right	2773	A
well you know i mean i i actually lived in Beirut from sixty eight to seventy- to eighty four and so i mean it's it's been dangerous for sometime i'm not sure that it and it's you know changed that much	2773	A
well see that's it- it really hasn't	2773	A
but but exactly it depends whether your talking- whether one talks physical or or sort of um cultural culturally i mean it obviously changed a lot	2773	A
uh because it's more a survival city but but the buildings are still intact it's still beautiful	2773	A
you know there's there was garbage on the corners when i got there and there's garbage when i left but i mean this is just a different uh cultural aspect i mean the trucks don't come daily and and you really don't want the garbage in your house so	2773	A
and i mean i traveled extensively -extensively in the area too and um so that you know many of the countries Turkey and Syria are still the same as they were before for traveling	2773	A
um	2773	A
yeah i was never able to go to Baghdad it was i never could get a visa so even before i mean even when things were good in the Middle East Americans weren't really given visas to Baghdad	2773	A
and um but it's it's a very beautiful part very interesting historically of course which was my interest is art history	2773	A
so um	2773	A
yeah	2773	A
right right	2773	A
uh-huh	2773	A
i see	2773	A
i see well great and um you know have a good business trip	2773	A
okay thank- bye-bye	2773	A
well i i i was uh it was favorable i i just uh i think the sanctions would have worked uh but it would have taken longer and uh now with all this stuff coming out with Woodward's book and everything uh	2773	B
and then i saw a Nightline program last night about all the uh funding of uh Hussein uh back as early as eighty- nineteen eighty six so uh	2773	B
-has there been a different turn and then i don't think we projected what was going to happen uh after the war well- it got over so fast so uh	2773	B
well it- uh just came out uh i guess yesterday it's called the Commanders and it's uh it says um big story in the paper about it today Bush trying to comment on it that	2773	B
uh Colin Powell was uh was against uh an early uh he he was for sanctions	2773	B
and so it seems like there's you know always somebody digging things like that but i'm not for sure we know exactly what what all happened in that situation so uh	2773	B
we we were so uh fast to get over the Vietnam whatever the Vietnam syndrome is that i i'm afraid now we've tied ourselves up there in the Middle East for	2773	B
a long period of time	2773	B
i	2773	B
yeah i just think the i think if we had been very i- i mean if he had that good of a correlation through the United Nations- then they could have uh	2773	B
they they could have made sanctions work i'm pretty sure uh with that much support you would have just penalized any nation that uh broke the embargo	2773	B
we are we are i think uh you know in in uh	2773	B
we've just misread almost everything in that we always seem to be getting in bed with the wrong fellow for the next next tenure or next thing down the road and uh	2773	B
then we can and we don't seem to read Israel correctly so uh i don't know it should be a mess it's uh not going to be anything we're going to get out of very soon	2773	B
so	2773	B
right that they they can talk a good game but uh being a historian it's uh	2773	B
you know you read all that clear back at least to the turn of the century with all of the mess after first world war	2773	B
and we just uh we're still very- i- i uh you're- you're absolutely right too naive um we just if we do find so-called experts to- in in any area of the world we don't listen to them_1 so	2773	B
um i don't know be be interesting to keep watching i guess but i'm just afraid it's going it's going to break us	2773	B
so	2773	B
not very much uh in- in our colleges we're trying we're i happen to teach at college with tremendous number of international students and	2773	B
and cultural diversity is just something we really don't understand and it's uh it needs to be uh taught from the earliest grades with our school systems in such disarray i don't know if that it doesn't look terribly hopeful	2773	B
well you can at least uh give- give- uh uh give them_1 the awareness of the different cultures and uh you know have all sorts of um at- at least you know let them know what	2773	B
that that other people do things differently than	2773	B
than than maybe in their own neighborhood	2773	B
so and and when when when those people are around if they if you can get them to meet then we're all pretty much alike	2773	B
so uh	2773	B
but it's uh it's something as- you know as i said won't go away so uh	2773	B
well i would just think if Bush was so successful in lining up the correlation to prosecute a war then he should be equally successful in getting that same correlation to push the United Nations to um	2773	B
uh somehow persuade those nations to give the Kurds a a homeland they were promised that nineteen uh nineteen and that	2773	B
well that's the same thing they uh they haven't been waiting quite as long even though they've been waiting since forty eight uh that	2773	B
that- that becomes a different matter simply because you're dealing with Israel and and they seem to be more intractable than ever	2773	B
uh that Shamir can't can't retain his leadership if he if he backs down the slightest bit so uh	2773	B
i just don't see us uh you know i don't think there's anybody of of major stature on the scene of like some of the great statesman of the past	2773	B
or at least we thought they were i'm not for sure that they were they they seem to have gotten us into some of these messes but	2773	B
well	2773	B
well	2773	B
i wish we could stay out of it but but the oil's not going to allow us to we absolutely need that oil that's the major thing if we didn't need the oil and and if we didn't have the ties with the Israelis we could probably stay out of it	2773	B
but i'm not for sure that we're we're not destined at least for	2773	B
the foreseeable future as long as we can keep our head our own head above water to be the the world's leader	2773	B
so i Bush is probably if if he can keep that correlation together especially the French and the British and the Germans and and and be sure that the Japanese can kick in some of their money	2773	B
um they may just have to i don't know what type pressure they can put on uh all the nations there too because_1 now that the war's over the societies have gone back just about to their own	2773	B
uh cold selves and uh i wouldn't have necessarily fought for the Kuwaitis they uh they're nobody likes them_1 in that part of the world uh but it's- it's just such a	2773	B
such a volatile uh area i mean there's just no stability there period that's what's	2773	B
um-hum	2773	B
absolutely not no	2773	B
yeah i think you're right i it's not our uh role to make everybody like us	2773	B
uh yeah but it's just uh for those who who may have wanted to travel in that part of the world uh that are up in the age i am it's going	2773	B
eliminate that for awhile i just don't think it's going to be too dangerous to be any place in there	2773	B
oh did you	2773	B
yes	2773	B
yeah well uh i i i i haven't been to Beirut but i've heard what a wonderful city that's just totally gone to uh ruin	2773	B
it hasn't well see that's what we get from	2773	B
um-hum	2773	B
oh okay	2773	B
sure yeah	2773	B
right okay	2773	B
okay	2773	B
right	2773	B
i that's one part of the world i've i've been to north Africa a lot but not um i haven't been to Beirut or	2773	B
or Syria or Israel- or uh Baghdad i would love to go there	2773	B
yeah	2773	B
right	2773	B
right-	2773	B
sure	2773	B
oh yeah	2773	B
well i think we've done them_1 a good job today then	2773	B
for this little project they're doing	2773	B
in fact i just talked to the director awhile ago so uh	2773	B
he was checking to see if i was going to stay in because_1 i've been so busy with this presidential search i haven't had a chance to really do any calling myself	2773	B
so uh	2773	B
anyway	2773	B
thank you and you continue your fine trip bye-bye	2773	B
well as much as i'd uh i'd like to say that i'll be looking for a flashy convertible or a or a four by four or something i guess the next car i'll be looking for is a kind of a plain old four door	2702	A
oh we've got a uh an older Delta Eighty Eight and then uh our our newer car is a uh a Corsica and uh we'll probably be looking for something about that uh that same style that same kind of four door hard top style and	2702	A
uh no but we're planning for it so uh in fact uh our Oldsmobile is a is a like an old Delta Eighty Eight but it's in pretty good shape- it's in really good shape and we've been really pleased with Oldsmobiles that's probably where the first place we'd look	2702	A
but uh	2702	A
uh-huh	2702	A
that'll do it	2702	A
yep	2702	A
uh-huh	2702	A
oh jeez	2702	A
um-hum	2702	A
yeah	2702	A
really	2702	A
um-hum	2702	A
oh jeez	2702	A
um-hum	2702	A
yeah yeah	2702	A
um-hum	2702	A
yeah yeah sounds like you you need at least like a Taurus size or something like that	2702	A
yeah i- i know- i know a lot of the guys at work they uh the ones that have uh families uh and they still want kind of a sports car they've been uh a lot of them_1 been getting these uh Taurus SHOs	2702	A
that i guess it's the sport version of the Taurus in fact it comes with a standard stick and uh	2702	A
and a lot of those it comes with a bigger engine and the things like that but uh	2702	A
and usually they're in like black and gun metal grey and and those kind of colors you're not gonna see too many uh you know green ones or blue ones or anything like that they they put them_1 in sporty colors i guess but uh	2702	A
oh well sure that's what you know until till you look at the price tag and then you go what what would i really- besides tooling around and looking really cool and having a lot of fun what would i really do with this car if it what	2702	A
yeah i	2702	A
i went i went through that when i first got out of uh college i had an old car that i bought just to get to to my job- my first job	2702	A
and when i got there the first thing i did was trade it in on a Spitfire and i- i knew that was gonna be the only time i could afford a two seater uh sports car	2702	A
but that that just does not make it as an only car it's uh it's like i bought- i would i bought a set of stereo speakers	2702	A
and it was one of those cash and carry deals and i had to take them_1 one at a time with the top down	2702	A
and it was winter so i was like in this coat with the top down and the speaker in the passenger seat	2702	A
and i drove that one home and then i went back and got the other one and put that in the passenger seat and drove that one home	2702	A
and uh funny funniest sight and you kind of outgrow that real quick when it's your only car	2702	A
um-hum	2702	A
yeah	2702	A
oh really	2702	A
yeah	2702	A
uh-huh	2702	A
boy that's a good deal	2702	A
huh because_1 i- i know we've uh that's that's something that that we definitely have to go with is an automatic transmission my um my wife just does can't can't	2702	A
can't uh she doesn't really wanna learn i guess the uh the standard shift in fact i- i remember once we uh	2702	A
we uh went uh went on a uh test drive we got one of these things from Lee Iacocca that said you know i'll give you a fifty dollar savings bond if you'll test drive a car and we went uh we went uh	2702	A
we went to a dealership and uh	2702	A
it- it was it was pretty she- she did pretty well but it was one of these things where we just went to a big parking lot and the uh dealer kind of gave her standard shift parking because_1 that's all it was it was it was the funniest thing it was like a	2702	A
a big Le Baron- it- was a Le Baron with everything on it but it had a standard shift it was the craziest thing i ever saw and and and that's probably why they were trying to sell them_1 i guess	2702	A
and uh we just kind of went back and forth and back and forth she did pretty well after a while but uh it's it's kind of hard to learn i guess	2702	A
um-hum	2702	A
okay_1	2702	A
oh jeez	2702	A
yeah yeah	2702	A
what the oh well	2702	A
well i guess that i guess that's about all i got to say about cars	2702	A
uh-huh	2702	A
uh-huh i would think so yeah because_1 it's so big	2702	A
oh yeah	2702	A
sure sure	2702	A
um-hum	2702	A
uh-huh	2702	A
now now now that used to be a luxury but i bet on the next time you buy a car that's gonna be mandatory you've got to have that now you're used to it and you got to have it	2702	A
it probably does it probably does	2702	A
but uh	2702	A
oh well well Bill it's been nice talking to you okay you have a good evening um-hum bye-bye	2702	A
what kind of car do you have now	2702	B
yeah	2702	B
yeah	2702	B
you got kids	2702	B
okay	2702	B
yeah	2702	B
yeah	2702	B
huh	2702	B
well we've always had uh Fords uh mostly because my wife's stepfather works at a Ford dealership	2702	B
yeah that'll do it um but yeah we're we're in the same shape i think our next car will be a you know some big old four door uh	2702	B
something that can haul the kids to baseball practice and piano lessons and we've got a minivan	2702	B
and that's great	2702	B
and i drive- i drive uh well i used to drive an Escort but it died on me so i i mean i- i- i used to run it i uh where we used to live i used to commute a hundred and forty miles a day	2702	B
and uh and this Escort took it all and its it it got up to uh uh i was at ninety four thousand miles on it and the engine just went	2702	B
so i- i bought- i bought a used um Dodge Aries	2702	B
which has been okay i- i mean i haven't had it that long but it it'll it's an eighty five Aries but it only had thirty four thousand miles on it when i bought it	2702	B
and i just you know i just drive it to work so it's just a ten minute commute everyday	2702	B
so um it doesn't get much of uh i mean it's not like i'm putting it through its paces but i think uh and it's a four door which is nice but it's still a little cramped i've got three kids	2702	B
so i- i	2702	B
yeah that's what i was thinking of was a Taurus um	2702	B
oh really yeah	2702	B
ooh	2702	B
yeah	2702	B
yeah	2702	B
yeah well my wife wants a Miata	2702	B
right	2702	B
right yeah	2702	B
i know i know it's like i- i guess i could fit in it maybe	2702	B
yeah	2702	B
no	2702	B
yeah	2702	B
yeah	2702	B
oh no	2702	B
yeah	2702	B
yeah well i you know it's funny most people that i've talked to	2702	B
did stuff like that when they were in college or you know or when they were single anyway they'd they'd buy themselves a sporty car because it was their last- i never did that uh you know my first car was a Toyota Corolla	2702	B
and uh because i got a good deal on it and uh that was a great little car actually	2702	B
i met that's how i met girls	2702	B
was i'd find out if a girl could drive a manual transmission which i i'd never i i'd learned on an automatic transmission and so so i'd go out on dates where they would teach me how to drive this car	2702	B
and uh in fact i married one of those people and it worked yeah it worked all right real good	2702	B
yeah yeah	2702	B
yeah yeah	2702	B
yeah	2702	B
wow	2702	B
that's weird	2702	B
yeah	2702	B
huh	2702	B
yeah	2702	B
well my wife i mean she'd always driven standard transmission and uh and- and in fact all our earlier cars were standard- a standard transmission in fact the minivan's a has a stick shift	2702	B
and in fact- this Dodge Aries is the first car we've ever gotten that had anything you know it's got	2702	B
well um	2702	B
the the thing about this uh the i will say this about the minivan	2702	B
we thought that was a luxury car when we bought it it it	2702	B
yeah and and it was quiet it had a stereo system we never had it you know we always had the AM radio and uh course- this had stick shift it had speakers- speakers that you can control from the backseat	2702	B
and you can change the channels on the on the radio from the backseat too and put speaker- speaker phones in it so uh	2702	B
right	2702	B
that's right that's right	2702	B
and you got to pay for it too and i bet and i bet it costs twice as much as as when i bought mine	2702	B
well-	2702	B
nice talking to you	2702	B
thanks a lot bye bye	2702	B
oh well i think it needs some drastic uh	2791	B
drastic help um	2791	B
i- i think there's a lot of waste that that could uh that could be cut out	2791	B
if we could get uh politicians to be less less of politicians	2791	B
um	2791	B
and um	2791	B
i- i think it needs to be given a really high priority because_1 i- i think it has a horrible effect on the economy and and what we can do as a country and everything else	2791	B
sure	2791	B
right	2791	B
yeah	2791	B
yeah	2791	B
yeah	2791	B
yeah	2791	B
right i- i have a hard time with that too now i can understand	2791	B
uh for instance the uh	2791	B
situation in say the Philippines where they needed some cash to jump start their economy	2791	B
but i don't see where we i mean i think it's crazy to be just pouring money into an economy that's obviously mismanaged for instance um	2791	B
right	2791	B
yeah	2791	B
right	2791	B
right	2791	B
yeah	2791	B
i'm not sure i understand the i- i guess there's a	2791	B
a a reason for that and i- i just don't know enough about it to understand the sense of it because	2791	B
it's not an obvious i- i mean on the surface there's no obvious reason why we should be doing that	2791	B
i have to agree with you there	2791	B
right yeah	2791	B
yeah that there's some kind of justification there and i don't know what it is	2791	B
and i don't know if i agree with it or not yeah	2791	B
right	2791	B
right	2791	B
right	2791	B
right well you know the the the other thing is that you have all this- this all this partisan politics	2791	B
where you have a person who's representing a particular state	2791	B
and he says well my- my state it would advantageous	2791	B
if the if the United States spent money to uh you know to investigate uh potato blithe or something you know and that's and there is tons of that and	2791	B
and that is just a horrible waste of money i think and it's and it's done because some	2791	B
constituent you know i well it's done because they want to impress the the people that are going to vote for him next month	2791	B
and uh if if there was a way to get around that and i think i think some of that could be avoided if we put uh uh a finite term on on some of these peoples um	2791	B
uh uh you know stay in office um	2791	B
i- i think they would have- they wouldn't have time to i mean they'd have to	2791	B
i think their incentive would be to go out	2791	B
uh instead they'd concentrate on doing something that was significant um i would hope so anyway	2791	B
yeah	2791	B
yeah	2791	B
yeah sure	2791	B
right well that's that's you know that's the catch word these days is drug you know drug fight drug	2791	B
i mean he got himself	2791	B
yeah i don't know he it looked can look good on his resume- resume	2791	B
yeah	2791	B
yeah oh yeah and well you know it's like	2791	B
i've i've really gotten cynical i guess as i've gotten older but i've i've been watching you know the the campaigns and stuff and it's it just it's just amazing how little anybody really says	2791	B
oh that too	2791	B
right right	2791	B
well-	2791	B
no	2791	B
no i mean and because it's you know and it's because nothing is black and white	2791	B
you know you just can't go up and go up there and say well we're going to we're going to stop crime now	2791	B
and that's what kind- you know they there's the people that says well we'll we'll never raise taxes or we will raise taxes or you know it's like the guy who says you're never going to raise taxes	2791	B
doesn't isn't realistic about what he see you know what he's doing the guy who says well we should raise taxes	2791	B
will raise them but but it will all it the money will not help anything that's what kills me um you know the for instance here here in Texas they're talking about uh an income tax	2791	B
well i could almost support an income tax if they reduced or got rid of the sales tax	2791	B
yeah my favorite yeah yeah yeah yeah my favorite one about politicians is that a politician's a person who's made it to the top because he didn't have what it takes to make it at the bottom	2791	B
yeah	2791	B
yeah	2791	B
right	2791	B
yeah	2791	B
right	2791	B
well	2791	B
yeah the the problem is that the budget is so complicated	2791	B
and what they're doing are the things that are easy they're making the easy choices	2791	B
and and uh um	2791	B
and it's and i think part of it is that the budget you know the the economy and the budget is too complicated	2791	B
for a lot of the politicians i mean they can't comprehend um	2791	B
you know what it takes what it needs they just don't have the expertise the other thing is they can't it's too	2791	B
uh it's not in their	2791	B
political career interest to make some of the hard decisions that are going to need to be made	2791	B
uh and so what you do is you do the obvious things you know and and they they don't really help all that much i mean sure they help some and i'm sure-	2791	B
right	2791	B
right	2791	B
right right	2791	B
yeah	2791	B
well uh you know i think uh it's got to come from the you know it's it's got to be	2791	B
you know somebody has gotten angry enough and has got the time an the energy to to you know have to to develop something from the from the you know ground swell level	2791	B
you know where you get a petition up and you you know get signatures and you call for a referendum and it's not easy it's not easy	2791	B
yeah	2791	B
right	2791	B
right	2791	B
that's right well you know it and and what was supposed to be uh so healthy about our our former government is that these were	2791	B
regular people who were who you know these were the doctors and the lawyers and the accountants and the janitors and the uh who were in there for their brief period of time to do their to to to serve proudly and	2791	B
okay official time well what do you think of about the budget here you first	2791	A
oh yeah	2791	A
i know that we're affected uh directly uh at TI because of uh	2791	A
the defense budget cuts but i certainly think that's one of the the things that they're doing already which is uh which- which was needed to be done for probably the last few years uh	2791	A
although with the Russian situation and all the world situation changing the way it is uh	2791	A
it certainly needed i the obvious one that people all talk about that i still don't understand is uh i'm at work let me turn my radio off here	2791	A
uh is uh	2791	A
all the foreign aid i you know it's over it's a fifty years roughly since World War II	2791	A
i don't understand why we're i understand that we support Israel and all the other countries but why do we have to give them cash	2791	A
rather than just selling them	2791	A
military things at a discount or something i don't get the idea- the idea of giving people three billion dollars a year	2791	A
yeah	2791	A
right	2791	A
well i think that we should give humanitarian aid and that's it	2791	A
you know i think we can loan food or or relief relief aid or whatever you want to call it but i	2791	A
not cash money i think you can send them wheat in other words i think that helps our farmers but	2791	A
to send them money i don't i don't	2791	A
see under any circumstances where you send anybody money	2791	A
right	2791	A
i'm amazed that neither- neither party or or the which i guess they're independent parties too	2791	A
why they don't talk about it i mean they don't bring it up at all why you would think they'd be real having a real campaign with one party or the other	2791	A
and they never talk about it they just keep doing it you know	2791	A
i- i just like to hear them talk about it you know i like to hear some of the congressmen or senators at least	2791	A
say well let's let's bring this before let's examine every one of our foreign aids	2791	A
and look like like they did with the defense with the military bases they they investigated all those rightfully wrongly wrongfully whether which ones should be closed i don't know but	2791	A
at least they looked at it i think they should look at foreign aid and say hey which ones do we not need to give you know	2791	A
right yeah	2791	A
i know that is amazing	2791	A
um-hum	2791	A
oh i agree with you there	2791	A
yeah i saw one about a month or so ago on Twenty Twenty i think it was	2791	A
where one of the congressmen i think it was from Connecticut and i probably will will screw that up but	2791	A
he wanted to start	2791	A
another drug headquarters in his state	2791	A
and no one was asking for it but him	2791	A
and he got the money approved- got it approved by tagging it on to some other bill	2791	A
and it didn't- you know the the newsman asked him what- what- no one is asking for this why do you you know	2791	A
and it was just totally a boondoggle i mean it was just uh him wanting to build something that nobody wanted	2791	A
right	2791	A
right	2791	A
but the drug agency wasn't asking for it he was asking for it you know which didn't make any sense at all	2791	A
right	2791	A
it is amazing how the the congressmen and senators just start are totally in another world once they get elected	2791	A
right or well duh i thought you were going to say what they do	2791	A
i i've been trying to go over in my own mind when they say	2791	A
we're gonna really if you vote for me we're gonna control crime and drugs and then they don't do anything nothing they don't have they had any president or anybody every done anything against crime and drugs you know	2791	A
right	2791	A
right yeah exactly	2791	A
right exactly	2791	A
right	2791	A
right yeah you can't double up yeah	2791	A
exactly	2791	A
exactly they never go away	2791	A
the-	2791	A
the funniest thing i heard lately about politicians uh joke was uh	2791	A
uh do you know how you can tell it when a politician is lying	2791	A
his lips are moving	2791	A
that- that that that see that covers is all you know	2791	A
right yeah but it it is the the budget thing is just and i don't know why they don't talk about it logically it's always always uh	2791	A
again the only thing i guess they're doing logically now is the defense which is certainly hurting TI to a degree although we've done so well with the	2791	A
Gulf War we got a lot of good positive press	2791	A
with all the exotic uh weapon systems and i think we'll get a lot of those you know but uh	2791	A
uh you you need to close so many bases and you need to cut out some missiles or i mean some uh programs and all	2791	A
uh and they're doing that i think that's that's really good even though it it hurts a lot bit you know	2791	A
well then that's probably true	2791	A
um-hum	2791	A
right	2791	A
right	2791	A
i don't-	2791	A
go ahead i was going to say i know you mentioned it but i don't know why we can't change the laws where there- the congress and the	2791	A
senators just have eight years or or terms because the president has it	2791	A
and i think that uh is you know you don't want someone in there forever	2791	A
and the congressmen go in there forever and that's- that's their whole life then	2791	A
and their family's life and every one of their relatives gets on it has got a job you know it's ridiculous	2791	A
right there you go there you go	2791	A
no that's true	2791	A
maybe that long-term though i think that is a a factor that is to keep the	2791	A
our government uh rotating you know keep them moving uh	2791	A
and not get the career politicians huh	2791	A
yeah there's uh historians i thought that keep saying will that that never was meant that the	2791	A
politicians would make a career it was just something that you would serve like in the military	2791	A
and then you'd be done you know	2791	A
right right	2791	A
right	2791	A
right	2791	A
right-	2791	A
well um i don't have strong feelings about changes to be made in the uh jury system do you	2749	A
oh well then you must know a lot more about this than i do	2749	A
um-hum um-hum	2749	A
well what about the idea that one is only guilty uh when proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt	2749	A
i thought that was the point of uh a unanimous jury was the idea that if everyone agrees	2749	A
then there shouldn't be any reasonable doubt but if there are some people who don't agree	2749	A
um then there must be it seems to be there must be at least a reasonable doubt for some people	2749	A
really have you served on a jury	2749	A
i never have either but my friends my few friends who have uh say just the opposite	2749	A
they say they're uh remarkably incompetent	2749	A
and uh don't know what they're doing and say one thing in the courtroom and then as soon as they get in the back room they just start letting all their prejudices hang out and to to air and all that	2749	A
right in other words they don't want anyone with experience- anyone with particular experience or knowledge of the legal system	2749	A
and they tend and since anyone can get out of it who	2749	A
basically says they don't want to do it i mean you know it's it's anyone can get out of jury just about	2749	A
and uh so it it's um it's not really my peers that if i were arrested- let's say i were arrested falsely or not	2749	A
and put up for a jury i wouldn't feel that uh i would be being tried by a jury of my peers i'd be i mean i'd be tried by a jury of	2749	A
you know people who had nothing else to do and weren't very knowledgeable about certain sorts of things and uh i don't know i i get a little bit nervous about it and uh	2749	A
yeah i i was called once but i was out of the country and apparently i apparently they thought i served so i didn't i didn't make any noise about it	2749	A
i came back and they said the record showed i served but i was out of the country at the time so i'm pretty sure i didn't	2749	A
um	2749	A
yeah well i i i don't know i- i definitely feel like we need to keep it at least unanimous because um	2749	A
you know there's the classic sort of To Kill A Mockingbird kind of story where you get you know jury which	2749	A
can have all kinds of prejudices and things that a judge at least officially isn't supposed to have though of course they can too	2749	A
and um it seems to me that if you could just have a simple majority or something you could pretty much browbeat- you know	2749	A
browbeat the jury a majority in the of the a majority of the jury that's hard to say um	2749	A
so it's it's uh you know saying well look you know we don't like the way he looks and let's uh let's throw the rascal in jail and stuff	2749	A
and you also get a lot of um juries are extremely uh and from what i hear i i have i have some friends who do expert witness testimony	2749	A
and they say that uh juries are extremely vulnerable to uh sort of emotional pitches you know the prosecutor will want to uh	2749	A
oh i don't know show the show the mugging victim you know show what the nice person he was and what a family life and basically get the jury to be very sympathetic with the victim	2749	A
and uh or or uh if it's a corporation that was uh you know harming- harming some individual or something like that they get very much well you know it's just a big faceless company- corporation let's let's make them pay as much as possible things like that	2749	A
so not i i mean i'm the problem is i can't guarantee that a judge- judge would be necessarily be much better than a jury but i'd be real nervous having a jury not at least fully agree	2749	A
on what the settlements would be on things like that	2749	A
yeah	2749	A
um-hum	2749	A
well how about having a jury- jury and a judge work together on it somehow i wonder if that's possible	2749	A
i guess the judge's time is worth too much though	2749	A
they pay that judge they pay those jury members very little money compared to that judge he makes more money in an hour than all twelve of them put together	2749	A
um-hum um-hum	2749	A
oh of course it's it's political maneuvering the the one side is looking for someone whose face they think will you know want to hang everyone and the other one is going to look for someone very sympathetic they're not looking for someone whose going to be the most reasoned	2749	A
or sensible or rational juror neither side wants that they want to find a juror that's going to uh be most persuadable by their arguments you you know	2749	A
um i wish it were a little bit harder to not serve on juries actually i mean i know	2749	A
it it it's tricky because_1 i know you know an awful lot of intelligent people who just well i'm too busy to serve on a jury so i'll tell them that and they won't	2749	A
or just you know just answer one of the questions the wrong way because you can do that you know they just say do you believe in such and such um	2749	A
right course they'd be they would be barred but	2749	A
um-hum	2749	A
yeah well it sounds like we both need to get out there and serve on a jury i i hope we're called up before too long	2749	A
they will they will eventually	2749	A
okay well it was nice talking with you	2749	A
bye-bye	2749	A
uh not at all in fact i'm graduating from college in about a week and this past semester i've taken two criminal justice classes and have discussed a lot on trials	2749	B
um	2749	B
i think i think uh	2749	B
the system- the system right now you know should you know is fine i think it should be by a jury i don't think the judge should have i mean he's just there	2749	B
kind of like the referee	2749	B
uh	2749	B
i don't i don't even think that it should be unanimous either um	2749	B
um-hum	2749	B
right	2749	B
exactly	2749	B
uh-huh	2749	B
um	2749	B
i don't know i uh	2749	B
you you rarely hear you hear of course there's cases where someone has been put in in in uh prison	2749	B
uh falsely accused but uh	2749	B
more than likely the people that are on the the jury know what they're doing um i mean you	2749	B
never	2749	B
huh well you would think that they would get that in the uh when the prosecution and defense are choosing the jury	2749	B
you would think that those would come out and i- i know they automatically when you go through uh	2749	B
when you're chosen is you're automatically like a a a professor in criminal justice or something like that that you're automatically no they don't want you on the jury	2749	B
exactly	2749	B
uh-huh exactly uh	2749	B
um-hum	2749	B
um-hum	2749	B
i've i've never	2749	B
i've never even been called to jury duty	2749	B
yeah i um	2749	B
i don't know i think the i guess there's a lot of problems with the	2749	B
legal system	2749	B
um-hum	2749	B
um-hum	2749	B
um-hum	2749	B
right	2749	B
um-hum	2749	B
right- i um	2749	B
i uh i don't- i i don't think the judge should just make the decision alone least with the jury you have twelve people you know	2749	B
that are gonna decide	2749	B
you know you're the the person's fate	2749	B
right exactly	2749	B
probably yeah	2749	B
yeah but um no it's it's sad though that um	2749	B
that the people though that	2749	B
you you somebody's life is in twelve people's hands and sometimes those twelve people could care less	2749	B
and uh or they fool the the defense in thinking that they're you know because when they go through those processes they kind of pick out who they want	2749	B
exactly	2749	B
uh-huh	2749	B
oh yeah well	2749	B
i guess it's just that maybe people are you know upset at court	2749	B
you know if it was if it was a a family member of theirs though that was innocent and then they'd want to be on that jury	2749	B
but uh if everyone would take it i think if everyone took it seriously	2749	B
and um	2749	B
i mean	2749	B
something you have to do	2749	B
yeah i would love to be called- i'm ready to go they just haven't called me up yet	2749	B
it was nice talking to you	2749	B
bye-bye	2749	B
okay- a Ford Explorer a a Ford Explorer	2751	B
yeah one of the new ones	2751	B
and um i'd i'd probably buy another this is the first American vehicle i've owned so i would probably purchase another one	2751	B
um i would be more selective in the dealership that i purchased it from but as far as uh the quality seems to be there um it's quiet it's it handles well um	2751	B
but i believe i'd get that or a Porsche one of the two	2751	B
no not	2751	B
and why would that be	2751	B
what's wrong with the Volvo	2751	B
oh	2751	B
what-	2751	B
what what city are you calling from	2751	B
oh	2751	B
i'm Dallas um	2751	B
BMW or Mercedes yeah well that's uh that's um	2751	B
um-hum	2751	B
what do you presently drive	2751	B
um fun	2751	B
well there nothing wrong with those uh	2751	B
they're they're nice vehicles-	2751	B
they're nice vehicles nothing wrong with those it um	2751	B
it's just everybody has their own taste but man the Mercedes are expensive my wife has a Volvo and it it's nice i mean you know it's okay an	2751	B
huh	2751	B
oh no no no no no no no it it i- i kind of wish we would have maybe gone for the GL rather than the DL but because they it is the safest car on the road um oh yeah	2751	B
yeah they're the safest that's the reason why we mainly got it we got white and it's the safest four door and it's good for if you have a family which we do we just we just dominated everyone out and so it's it's uh um	2751	B
you know they're kind of low to the ground after driving the Explorer you know i presently i used to have a two eighty Z and i'm a tall guy and and uh	2751	B
they're hard to get around in traffic to see because_1 you can't see a car ahead of you but they're fast as lightning and all that crap but the Explorer i mean you're sitting up on top of everything and you can really see real well and i just it's it's so comfortable and	2751	B
and uh so you're what are your feelings about American versus European cars	2751	B
why not	2751	B
that's the way it goes i guess	2751	B
yeah i was real hesitant but it was	2751	B
i don't know uh i mean i think European cars are great course you've got to have metric wrenches and stuff and they're easy- some some of them are easy to work on a Volvo being a four cylinder is very easy to work on uh excellent warranty i mean just unbelievable warranty	2751	B
and and uh course Ford isn't too bad i think Chrysler would probably make a good vehicle uh but all of it has to do in my opinion with the service and the attitude of the service of the dealership	2751	B
i wouldn't send my dog to buy a car from Middlekauff Ford	2751	B
there's Middlekauff Ford in Plano	2751	B
their just their attitude is just slimy and and uh i've written a a letter to Middlekauff and i've told them_1 that matter of fact i got another letter last night from the Quality Ford Division	2751	B
they're still concerned about my attitude and it it will never change about that place and uh	2751	B
but uh anyway that's my own personal comment i guess but-	2751	B
Middlekauff wouldn't she needs to find herself a lawyer she'd she'd come out like a champ on that one	2751	B
so have- have you been using well anyway	2751	B
that was i was asking you some questions about the telephone and how long and how many have you been doing but that's they they don't want to hear that but-	2751	B
is that all a week	2751	B
good Lord i think i started in January or February oh God i've i'm like twenty some phone calls	2751	B
that's why i- i wasn't sure if this was the second time around or what	2751	B
well look i've enjoyed speaking with you	2751	B
and keep smiling	2751	B
bye bye	2751	B
okay what did you buy	2751	A
i'm sorry what	2751	A
oh really	2751	A
yeah	2751	A
uh-huh	2751	A
yeah	2751	A
oh really	2751	A
um	2751	A
if i had the money i think i would love to own a a BMW	2751	A
i don't know i from what or either that or Mercedes just because they're put together so well it seems like they last forever	2751	A
oh i don't know they're they're not as nice looking	2751	A
oh uh meant to me i don't know i'm sure there are some that are but everyone i've seen is kind of plain but	2751	A
Sherman	2751	A
where're you	2751	A
Dallas	2751	A
yeah	2751	A
if i had money- um had the money i mean that's just i know i never would own one but uh	2751	A
i don't know i like my actual favorite cars -is were uh like the Ford Thunderbirds of nineteen eighty five i really like that style- body style	2751	A
but i don't own one of those neither	2751	A
um Mercury Topaz	2751	A
cheap taste cheap taste in cars okay_1	2751	A
yeah they're all right it's it's a good car i mean i've never had any problem with it	2751	A
sorry i roped on Volvos then	2751	A
sorry i roped on Volvos then	2751	A
oh is it see i don't much about them_1 i guess	2751	A
yeah	2751	A
really	2751	A
uh-huh	2751	A
um	2751	A
i like anything besides Japanese course everything has Japanese parts in them_1 anymore i don't like Japanese cars but uh	2751	A
European i don't have have any i mean those are the kind i usually end up liking the most	2751	A
American cars a lot of people say they they don't last long but i've never had any problem with	2751	A
um my Mercury or my Cougar- my husband has a uh Cougar and he's never had any problem with it either so	2751	A
i don't know	2751	A
well what are your i guess this is your first time to buy American so	2751	A
yeah	2751	A
really	2751	A
yeah	2751	A
yeah	2751	A
where	2751	A
okay	2751	A
yeah this girl that works for me just bought a car down there and she- they they had a problem with they uh	2751	A
took their Camaro in to get it traded and they they hadn't signed any papers and they had all ready uh taken it in to paint it and everything and everything was stolen out of it and the people um wouldn't reimburse- reimburse them_1 for anything	2751	A
yeah	2751	A
so i've heard some stuff about them but um	2751	A
what	2751	A
oh just- just about a week	2751	A
yeah yeah	2751	A
so	2751	A
really	2751	A
oh wow	2751	A
yeah you too	2751	A
okay thanks bye	2751	A
well i guess i've uh just	2777	B
i've listened a lot to the media and i've tried to read some things on it and i've tried to take some steps to uh understand it and figure out where i am in the whole mess	2777	B
um apparently it's getting worse i mean i can tell that just by driving in Dallas you have the low flying- flying gray cloud on certain days but	2777	B
you know it really gets to you in terms of being able to breathe and and and things like that so we know that	2777	B
if you do the same thing to like your plants and you don't let them breathe they kind of die on you	2777	B
um and so you know looking at the different areas that um cause air pollution um i guess we have industry for one	2777	B
um that has to be i guess a little bit more aware of you know the output and uh harmful chemicals and things that they use um what do you think about that	2777	B
oh right	2777	B
yeah	2777	B
yeah	2777	B
oh good yeah	2777	B
right	2777	B
well that's true i think you know we we had such i mean i'm i'm close to forty and i can remember the good old days when we didn't have to worry about all this stuff and life was pretty you know	2777	B
um complacent in these areas and uh i think you're right though that we not only pay the price in money we're going to pay the price in our health and our future- you know in the future of whatever's going to happen here	2777	B
and you know it takes a few people you know on the alert to uh	2777	B
um really make a change and make a difference in the way people think and you're right about the education it's just got to be little by little by little	2777	B
until people become aware but i think we've got sort of a snowball effect going on now and	2777	B
i think that you know in terms of air pollution we're um pinpointing certain you know industries in our own communities	2777	B
that are you know blatantly um abusing the airspace	2777	B
and i think we're beginning to make them aware that um you know it's not just the	2777	B
a financial bottom line that they have to look at it's you know um it has a a bigger impact on the on the whole environment and the whole area	2777	B
and gosh i i don't know you know health seems to get in in the act too you know your your health and your lungs and and all this i mean this comes down to smokers	2777	B
and i don't know what to do about smokers because you know that's sort of an infringement of they're rights see you can go overboard too you can be real radical about this and i'm not for that i'm for	2777	B
persuading people by the use of education and by demonstration and by um you know your example of how things go	2777	B
um and you know i know there's some real radicals out there and and that that'll tend to turn you off anytime and think that they're you know full of baloney and they're not	2777	B
you know on the right planet sometimes	2777	B
but you know what i mean about that	2777	B
think it's education like you said that really needs to and it starts with you	2777	B
like you said just tell them_1 to you know	2777	B
what- why you're doing why you're collecting cans and why you're collecting glass and why you're recycling the stuff and gosh	2777	B
oh	2777	B
yeah	2777	B
just as yeah	2777	B
well get- it's yeah it's hard it's really hard and they have to maybe sort of like	2777	B
like hit bottom like they either have to die or they have to be you know totally incapacitated before they change their mind and you know	2777	B
bless their hearts you can't do anything that will impact them or or you you can't find a way really that it's	2777	B
it's it's almost like you know you can talk about alcoholism too i mean you know in this hidden in this manner sometimes i think that it's just a person has to change their mind	2777	B
and uh it's tough but um	2777	B
sort of thing and and they respect that or else they just don't come back they don't smoke in my car	2777	B
and you know and it's not getting to be a big deal anymore i	2777	B
you know they they seem to uh understand or at least have a little bit of respect for your wishes and and they don't just necessarily light up and and uh you know not expect to get some flack these days	2777	B
yeah	2777	B
well yeah	2777	B
uh-huh	2777	B
use your own lungs don't borrow mine to take part in your air	2777	B
yeah well things are getting i mean like i said	2777	B
i don't know why i know how old i am and i know that i never had to worry about the stuff i thought you know the grass is green the sky was blue and the ocean was a pretty light blue you know	2777	B
and and i'm finding out that that's not always the case anymore and that you know the damage has been done	2777	B
and you know we're left with a mess in a lot of ways you know caused by um starting with the air pollution and	2777	B
and that's just one of the factors that goes into you know trying to get this place cleaned up but	2777	B
oh	2777	B
really	2777	B
yeah	2777	B
oh i remember yeah oh i'm from Chicago	2777	B
grew i grew up in Chicago so yeah you know we had a lot of snow up there	2777	B
oh absolutely	2777	B
all right Betty uh what do you think about air pollution what all you know about it	2777	A
uh-huh	2777	A
right	2777	A
uh-huh	2777	A
well i think it's very true uh they're a lot of companies that don't have much regard for the environment they're	2777	A
primary goal is to produce a product as cheaply as they can and uh	2777	A
you know some environmental standards like a filters on smokestacks et cetera are quite expensive	2777	A
and they just don't want to sink the money into it unless someone clamps down on them_1 makes them_1 do it	2777	A
and dumping chemicals et cetera and all that you know they're just looking for the easy way out which you know i guess	2777	A
they're very shortsighted and they only look at what interests them and so i guess	2777	A
sort of you got- you got to blame them_1 but you understand what they're why they don't do it you just have to educate these people	2777	A
to what they're actually doing show them like this is what your plant is doing and we as consumers have to be prepared to pay a higher cost for the product	2777	A
which probably	2777	A
stops a lot of people from getting involved in the environmental issues	2777	A
you know they besides sinking their own time into it is	2777	A
that when we police these companies you know they say well look we're having to pay two million to put this filter device on it you're going to pay an extra thirty cents at the store for uh whatever	2777	A
and we're like oh no you know that's a so- but and recycling i'm big on recycling and uh	2777	A
but you know a lot of people aren't i mean people i know that are just- you know they're good people and they know i go you don't recycle that uh no	2777	A
like well just stick it in a different bag you know like aluminum cans like if i if i give you a bag and you stick the cans in there will you give them_1 to me oh yeah i'll do so you know i'll	2777	A
i'm going to work on doing that a little bit more to people that you know they just aren't	2777	A
they're just not either not aware or they just don't think about it	2777	A
uh-huh	2777	A
uh-huh	2777	A
right	2777	A
yeah	2777	A
yeah-	2777	A
yeah	2777	A
they're	2777	A
it just seems though um i guess we could talk about smoking because_1 it is a form of air pollution and uh	2777	A
oh my my father passed away at the age of fifty of a coronary artery disease and he had smoked	2777	A
you know pretty heavily since he went in the Army at like age eighteen	2777	A
and you know i've been fairly well educated on that subject and and i feel that uh you know that was a primary factor that caused his premature death	2777	A
so i'm sort of on a band wagon to say about the smoking- the adverse affects of smoking	2777	A
and i just wonder you know all the time when i was a little kid breathing the smoke- secondhand smoke which people say is just as bad or even worse- worse	2777	A
than what the smoker gets through the filter you know what affect that had on me for a coronary artery disease when i was younger but	2777	A
you know i i don't think i'm what you would call a a radical but it just seems that people that smoke	2777	A
you just don't	2777	A
they just don't listen	2777	A
right	2777	A
yeah	2777	A
uh-huh	2777	A
yeah	2777	A
yeah	2777	A
yeah	2777	A
yeah so i guess the education has	2777	A
sunk in a little bit as to not you know as to respect another- another person's clean air in that respect	2777	A
but	2777	A
um	2777	A
i had an uncle that had quadruple bypass surgery and was near death many times	2777	A
and he's know- you know they've told him for years to quit smoking and he still smokes you know	2777	A
you know some people are just	2777	A
but he's he's good and then he came to visit and he would run outside to smoke instead of smoking in the house so you know i have to say well i guess if you're going to do it do it out there and don't	2777	A
right that's cool	2777	A
um-hum	2777	A
yeah if you notice uh i'm from Indiana and we really gauge the weather the winters by how much snow we get	2777	A
so uh	2777	A
it's when i was growing up you always could expect some snowfall twenty four even up to we had thirty eight inches of snow one time	2777	A
but the last few years we've barely gotten any snow at all	2777	A
yeah it's you know maybe there'll be six inches on the ground at one time	2777	A
and it'll blow for a while and then it'll all melt away it's just like they kept talking about this you know the global warming the greenhouse effect and all that well i can just see it because_1	2777	A
you know school would get canceled probably a week week and a half each year	2777	A
pardon	2777	A
yeah you had a lot of snow and and you always had to scoop it and it was it was fun to play in but you know last few years	2777	A
i was i might have had it sitting there somewhere	2715	A
okay okay	2715	A
it's it's- it's supposed to be on the instruction sheet but	2715	A
i didn't see one on mine	2715	A
hm	2715	A
yeah	2715	A
okay	2715	A
zero three two seven- okay	2715	A
okay	2715	A
oh okay okay that'll work okay let me hit one now	2715	A
okay uh in my community they are doing a lot as- as- as far as recycling goes uh Waco's a pretty small city and so a lot of the city people	2715	A
i guess they want they take they take care of the community more than i would think that a big city does	2715	A
or they can because they're smaller and so they're doing all kinds of recycling projects and the school kids are doing all kinds of things and i'm a i'm a news reporter and so i	2715	A
report on a lot of the recycling things that they do and just last week they opened up a new recycling center uh so now they have two uh in an adjoining community uh Hewett	2715	A
they are doing uh curbside recycling which is something a lot of cities are starting to look into but for some cities it's very expensive	2715	A
so	2715	A
uh-huh	2715	A
right	2715	A
um-hum	2715	A
right	2715	A
um-hum	2715	A
yeah that's a form of the curbside yeah	2715	A
um	2715	A
um-hum	2715	A
i know even uh Wal-Mart Department Store i don't if they do it there they have the recycling bin right outside the store	2715	A
and it's got glass aluminum plastic and	2715	A
uh-huh	2715	A
right the plastic bags-	2715	A
um-hum	2715	A
uh-huh yeah	2715	A
wow	2715	A
do you recycle yourself at home do you	2715	A
um-hum	2715	A
uh-huh	2715	A
um-hum	2715	A
hm	2715	A
it's kind of rough doing the newspaper i understand because_1 the they can't recycle the uh i guess it's the sale papers that have the color on them	2715	A
and so it's kind of hard for them to i guess uh separate all that	2715	A
um-hum yeah i don't think anybody would you know i don't think they can put the colored paper on there or something so that should be pretty difficult	2715	A
i don't recycle myself- i live i'm single and so i guess if i had a family i'd probably be more aware than now that i am single but uh	2715	A
yeah yeah especially on my job i'm hardly ever home so you know my	2715	A
uh-huh	2715	A
yeah yeah	2715	A
um-hum yeah	2715	A
you just go in and you don't know when you're coming out	2715	A
so but uh let's see what else are they doing	2715	A
uh jeez i'm all out of recycling	2715	A
um-hum	2715	A
uh-huh	2715	A
hm	2715	A
right my mother before all this recycling stuff started i guess well not before it all started but she would collect the cans and you go like in front of the supermarkets or whatever and you put the cans in this	2715	A
bin thing and it spits out money yeah that's	2715	A
yeah yeah that that freaked me out when we first did that i thought okay	2715	A
we got like eight cents or something yeah exactly	2715	A
uh so at work we do recycle- we have a little recycling bin for our cans and bottles and uh those go out	2715	A
uh-huh	2715	A
hm	2715	A
uh-huh	2715	A
um-hum	2715	A
wow	2715	A
wow	2715	A
right	2715	A
uh-huh	2715	A
just regular paper and	2715	A
hm	2715	A
right	2715	A
um-hum	2715	A
um-hum	2715	A
oh	2715	A
so like	2715	A
so that gives you kind of an incentive	2715	A
well that's great if you know that like a lot of things you pick up today almost everything says	2715	A
recyclable or this is made from recyclables or something it's it's amazing it really is it's amazing to me how fast i i'm sure recycling's been going on forever and it's just	2715	A
i guess everyone is picking it up now you know but it's just amazing to me how much it's come in the last year since last Earth Day you know everything's i mean recycle recycle everywhere you go	2715	A
um-hum um-hum	2715	A
um-hum	2715	A
hm	2715	A
yeah i guess that was a form of but now it's just like perpetrated into the crowd- into the you know society it's like if you don't recycle you feel you feel almost uh	2715	A
i don't know like you're doing something wrong or you feel guilty almost so hm	2715	A
yeah wasteful um-hum um-hum	2715	A
uh-huh	2715	A
yeah	2715	A
yeah	2715	A
throw it away that's it	2715	A
yeah we're spoiled very spoiled	2715	A
right i know i'm doing the story- big story i'm covering now is of about our landfill here	2715	A
and uh what was it i think twenty four million tons of garbage that we throw away	2715	A
everywhere- everywhere- America could be recycled	2715	A
like twenty four million to and i think that accounts for uh i think one quarter or half of the landfill space	2715	A
so i mean i just learn all these little	2715	A
uh propaganda things	2715	A
oh yeah	2715	A
yeah	2715	A
not at all	2715	A
hm	2715	A
um-hum	2715	A
hm	2715	A
Mount Trashmore i haven't heard of that one	2715	A
yeah that's like the big stink around here this landfill thing they're wanting to expand it and a lot of the community- the people that live around the area don't want it expanded because you know they say it'll uh	2715	A
uh poison their water and you know poison the air and there's an elementary school right across the street and all kinds of stuff so it's a pretty pretty big issue	2715	A
um-hum	2715	A
exactly	2715	A
um-hum	2715	A
um-hum	2715	A
right right that's what a lot of people are saying that it may not hurt now but they're looking in the long run you know and they're saying well forty years from now we'll	2715	A
yeah	2715	A
um-hum	2715	A
hm	2715	A
yeah people don't want to wait	2715	A
no i well can you hold up let me i've got a portable phone here let me just turn it on real quick i can go over to where i think i might have it	2715	B
okay let's see here i just	2715	B
yeah oh yeah here we go	2715	B
let's see just a second- oh it doesn't	2715	B
um gee if i was at work i could give you a number- i tell you what	2715	B
call this number in the in uh uh during the day nine nine five zero three two seven	2715	B
and- and uh person who answers there'll be able to help you	2715	B
my wife happens to be a secretary in the in- in the group that does this	2715	B
okay	2715	B
yeah	2715	B
yeah	2715	B
uh-huh	2715	B
oh	2715	B
yeah	2715	B
yeah Plano just uh just started a program where they uh they gave everybody these big plastic garbage cans	2715	B
and uh what they're doing is on Thursday they pick up the regular garbage and these plastic garbage cans but on Mondays uh if you leave- they have these special huge paper bags	2715	B
and if you put your clippings in that they'll pick that up on Mondays -and	2715	B
yeah- right and then as i understand it they're uh they're planning to um start giving everybody containers to put aluminum and glass in to to recycle that as well so	2715	B
right	2715	B
oh wow	2715	B
yeah i know all the the grocery stores here have a a bins when you walk in if you want to recycle your paper bags or plastic bags	2715	B
so uh i think it's great uh um i know the kids uh at school are being indoctrinated into the whole idea i know my daughter came home the other night	2715	B
and um she was all excited because they gave her an eight hundred number to call to find out where your local recycling center was	2715	B
and she called it and turns out the the nearest one's in Garland which is about i don't know forty five minutes to an hour from here but	2715	B
yeah we um in fact i've got a car full of newspapers that we're trying to	2715	B
the uh here's a sort of i guess a a setback uh there were a couple of places that used to collect newspapers just around here and we went to all of them_1 yesterday and none of them_1 had bins for for the papers so	2715	B
i don't know if they just discontinued it or	2715	B
oh yeah	2715	B
yeah i know we don't sort that out um	2715	B
yeah and	2715	B
oh yeah	2715	B
yeah	2715	B
right	2715	B
right i i you probably uh eat uh fast food type stuff and uh on the go	2715	B
yeah well when i was single i was a reporter too i so i uh i can identify with you um uh i know that a lot of times that you're working double shifts and odd hours and	2715	B
you just eat when you have something to eat	2715	B
right	2715	B
so	2715	B
i know uh the Boy Scouts collect newspapers here and uh and uh in- in fact the there's a the kids at the end of the block come by every once in a while when they want extra money	2715	B
they they come by uh collecting aluminum cans because we have places that you can go where you can the city- the city has places where you can just dump the aluminum cans but uh	2715	B
yeah	2715	B
yeah yeah well that's where that's where these kids take their aluminum cans	2715	B
yeah	2715	B
yeah the where where i work they just started a paper drive and in fact everybody has two trash cans	2715	B
uh one is for your normal crap- trash and one is just for paper and they uh they had a big campaign for it and there's a list of things that you're allowed to put in the paper bin	2715	B
and uh you know and but they they're pretty good about it it doesn't you know you can have the staples in them_1 and the paper clips on them_1 and the plastic windows	2715	B
they take care of all of that but they don't want certain types of paper uh they don't want anything you know they don't want you know like transparencies overheads you know they don't want any of that in there	2715	B
right they don't want the garbage from your from your lunch in there um and uh and there's uh even little um uh this uh board	2715	B
outside the cafeteria that that shows uh has a it's a picture of a tree	2715	B
with a with a squirrel going up and it's like a a a gauge and the higher the squirrel goes up the more trees you've saved	2715	B
and it shows you how many thousands of trees uh have been saved because of the recycling program at work	2715	B
right right	2715	B
right	2715	B
right right yeah yeah	2715	B
right	2715	B
oh yeah	2715	B
right well i know when i was a kid uh which was quite a while ago um we used to collect newspapers and take them_1 to the there was a uh	2715	B
i don't know what it was a plant that it was a paper plant i guess it was- that was fairly close to where i lived in Richmond Virginia and um	2715	B
you could you bring your papers in to sell them_1 there i remember doing that when i was a kid and uh	2715	B
oh yeah sure yeah	2715	B
right that's right	2715	B
right	2715	B
that's right yeah well that's good i mean we're such a we're such a um throwaway society	2715	B
it's uh it's nice because_1 you know uh if you talk to people who grew up during the depression	2715	B
yeah i you know i guess i believe the propaganda if you want to call it that that uh um you know we're uh	2715	B
we're we we have limited resources and uh we really should think about uh conserving them instead of wasting them_1	2715	B
uh-huh	2715	B
wow	2715	B
yeah	2715	B
wow	2715	B
wow	2715	B
yeah	2715	B
you can't always i mean it'd be nice if you could if the landfill space was reusable but it isn't- it all it it isn't always- i know sometimes it is	2715	B
i know there's place called Mount Trashmore- Trashmore which is a a park that they built on top of a landfill	2715	B
and i can't remember where it is i think it's in Washington DC or thereabouts	2715	B
yeah	2715	B
but uh	2715	B
yeah	2715	B
yeah	2715	B
well yeah i i guess uh you know the scary- the the scary part is that you don't know what the effects are you know fifty years from now	2715	B
you know it's easy to say well we'll build a concrete hole and and nothing'll happen and then they'll say well the only way to test that is over a long period of time so	2715	B
right	2715	B
right and there's	2715	B
and there's no way to measure that i mean you you know you the only way is to take the chance and see what happens forty years from now and who knows what kind of havoc you've created	2715	B
uh by the	2715	B
no nope-	2715	B
how bad is it do you have smog like they do in California	2752	A
uh-huh	2752	A
hm depends_1 on whether you have some sort of temperature inversion i take yeah	2752	A
um-hum um-hum	2752	A
what do you think is your primary cause of it	2752	A
you do you really think cars contribute a lot now that they've taken lead out of gas	2752	A
um-hum	2752	A
hm my goodness	2752	A
um-hum	2752	A
i think a lot of it's industrial i also think uh that uh there is a certain amount that comes from automobiles but it's mostly from older automobiles i don't think the newer automobiles are as polluting uh frankly i think that uh	2752	A
i think that um	2752	A
uh if uh i- i- i heard a story a while back something effect that if they could just pay to get twenty percent or take all the cars off of the road that have been	2752	A
uh manufactured say before nineteen seventy five that they could cut the automobile pollution by over fifty percent just by getting rid of those cars that are still left remaining	2752	A
yeah from- from cars that is not from- not total but just from cars okay	2752	A
so that i think would be a tremendous help and i happen to drive an old model car because it's very economical and it just keeps getting uh	2752	A
gives me good service and i don't have an incentive to get rid of it long as it keeps running good and not costing me any money on the other hand i know it's a much more polluter than any of the newer model cars i have	2752	A
yeah	2752	A
yeah yeah oh uh yeah it's it's uh pretty heavy up here i think but i think it's mostly industrial is what i really uh believe is the the main problem and	2752	A
and uh	2752	A
and uh uh people uh i don't think are paying as close attention to it in this area as they frankly should i i we we seem to have a high uh cancer rate up here in Maryland	2752	A
yeah and uh	2752	A
well uh for instance breast cancer seems to be pretty rampant and uh i think of course prostrate cancer's sort of bad for everybody	2752	A
but uh this- this- this state was like uh second my wife's a registered nurse and i think this state was like second this year from the top in terms of uh cancer rate	2752	A
for just all kinds and i can't help but believe that's not partially caused from pollution i just don't know exactly what it necessarily is but i just can't believe this now we have a lot of pollution being caused by chlorofluorocarbons- uh fluorocarbons	2752	A
which is the like freon twelve and freon twenty two they use freon twenty two in air conditioning systems in houses and the like and heat pumps and they use freon twelve in car air conditioners and that's also what's causing our atmosphere to lose it's ozone layer	2752	A
and i can't help believe if it's sufficient enough to make the atmosphere lose it's ozone layer that it's not acting as a pollutant in our lungs also and having all kinds of effects and-	2752	A
well they're working now i know DuPont and Dow and several other chemical companies are working uh feverishly to try to come up with a substitute for fluorocarbons and whoever does is gonna make a a mint because if they ever come up with a reasonable	2752	A
working agent in place of fluorocarbons then uh	2752	A
well they used to be but they made them_1 take it out of that	2752	A
right	2752	A
no they they they made- passed a law and made them_1 take fluorocarbons out of the aerosol containers	2752	A
and that was a move in the right direction we are doing some things to try to correct the problem but there are more things we could do and getting rid of old cars like i said is one way to help correct the problem	2752	A
uh uh just trying to i think be careful uh with the way you handle garbage i notice in this state i don't know if you're doing it in Texas yet or not but in this state we have special containers now we have to put all our cans and bottles and plastic pieces	2752	A
uh you know containers in yeah	2752	A
yeah well we are doing it pretty religiously in our group too but they uh in one of the counties here they're actually doing a trial program of having a trash police	2752	A
they have a lady that goes around like a meter maid and she spot checks people's trash and if they find a bottle or a can or anything like that in your trash they'll fine you fifty bucks i think the first time and two fifty the second time	2752	A
yeah you right you got to give people incentives and surprisingly enough just handling of trash uh can cut pollution	2752	A
uh from uh uh from just throwing it in a dump or or or or whatever else they used to do with it maybe used to burn it they've stopped that up here too	2752	A
but that that will cut pollution too because_1 you get a lot of out gassing from these things i think decaying and trying- and trying to for instance cans and bottles they never go away at all	2752	A
well on on the other had i don't guess they're polluting but plastic containers and the like uh they may be	2752	A
ah i'm not sure of that	2752	A
oh i think that's very important to do i i really think that uh trying to get along with your environment and help it out is a very very important thing and uh that can help to cut pollution i guess some i- i don't know how much	2752	A
trees actually act as filtering agents in terms of pulling various pollutants or chemicals out of the air i would hope that they would help some though that's for sure	2752	A
um	2752	A
um-hum	2752	A
um-hum	2752	A
oh good	2752	A
well that uh that i think may go on a lot	2752	A
and the primary reason i think it may go on a lot is just as you said somebody happened to stay up late night or something i don't think we have a adequate policing	2752	A
uh especially- particularly on industry	2752	A
uh we have good policing at least in this state and and uh several of the surrounding states and probably yours too of car pollutants because we have to go down uh once a year here in Maryland and get our car's exhaust systems checked for emissions content	2752	A
um-hum	2752	A
uh no we don't have a state inspection but anytime you sell a car or buy a car it has to be inspected in this state	2752	A
i don't know uh it- that's something that you'd have to just check with your authorities but in this state we have to uh pay eight dollars and a half and go to a an emission station once a year	2752	A
and get everyone of our cars checked that are have been made starting in nineteen seventy three	2752	A
no no we don't have inspections like that now i'm in Maryland in Virginia they check that every two years i think	2752	A
and i think that's a good idea too not not- not that it necessarily has anything to do with cutting pollution necessarily- necessarily but i think it's a good idea the emissions check though is required in Maryland and it's also required in Virginia	2752	A
uh a sister state to to this and that's that goes a long ways towards cutting pollutants	2752	A
um-hum well if they don't i would imagine in time they'll get along with it- they'll get around to it and if they don't then that's something i would certainly- certainly uh uh suggest you'd be willing to uh um be for in terms of uh yeah yeah	2752	A
oh yeah i i agree now that's another area we hadn't even discussed and that is water pollution and various of the other types of uh	2752	A
of uh like food pollution i mean you you hardly ever hear hear anybody say anything about food pollution but i think there we have a pretty good handle on inspection of foods in this country so	2752	A
uh hopefully we're not ingesting too much in the way of uh pollutants in our food but water pollution uh	2752	A
i've worried uh especially the last few years about just how good the water supply we have in this country is for drinking and the like i know a lot more people are going to bottled water	2752	A
yeah	2752	A
tap yeah	2752	A
um-hum	2752	A
yeah- yeah	2752	A
i'm absolutely for drinking water out of wells as long as you first of course have it checked because_1 it seems uh when i was a kid growing up down south uh i used to go out in the country where my grandparents were and we had a well with one of those draws that	2752	A
i forget what you call those things and and that was some of the best tasting water i mean i can still to this day taste that water	2752	A
yeah	2752	A
uh-huh	2752	A
huh	2752	A
oh i bet it was yeah the- it- once it's been filtered and if it's a deep enough well filtered through all the earth and everything i think that uh it depends of course where you are a good well though i think is very healthy	2752	A
okay yes we do have pollution in Houston and it	2752	B
well it it some i think it depends on uh you know what the how- the cloud cover and like right now it's uh	2752	B
it's kind of overcast you know just it's hot and the sun is trying tries to shine through but it it's it's holding in this this pollution and i- i think so and uh we have uh	2752	B
Pasadena Texas which is sort of between here and- you know heading toward Galveston i mean it's still part it's part of the Houston metropolitan-	2752	B
well i think it's industry and i think it's cars i-	2752	B
i don't i well maybe not but it it sure it sure seems- you know it i- i know that when i'm when i'm behind a car and uh sometimes	2752	B
uh i can really smell especially diesel and things like that you know comes right in	2752	B
to my air conditioner and you know my head and my face- i'm so stopped up right now i don't know if it's uh if it's partly from what's blooming you know right now pollen and stuff like that that's part of it but um	2752	B
um-hum	2752	B
um-hum	2752	B
you mean uh fifty percent pollution total from that comes from	2752	B
oh uh-huh	2752	B
um-hum	2752	B
um-hum	2752	B
right well-	2752	B
do y'all have pollution in your country- part of the country uh from industry	2752	B
really like what kind- any particular kind or just all kinds	2752	B
hum	2752	B
um-hum	2752	B
um-hum	2752	B
well what can we do about the the the the air conditioning problem	2752	B
um-hum	2752	B
is that also what's in uh hairspray- aerosol	2752	B
even uh so so the aerosol is still aerosol but it doesn't have anything that's damaging	2752	B
um-hum well that's good	2752	B
here they've just started started doing that it's it's you know you're not you don't have to but most- you know i- i know i am i save	2752	B
no kidding	2752	B
you really oh	2752	B
is that right	2752	B
well we need to do something we need to get serious about it	2752	B
um-hum	2752	B
um-hum	2752	B
how much does uh planting more trees and things like that help	2752	B
i have too	2752	B
um-hum	2752	B
well i think uh it seems like there was something going on around- around here that you know we have all these chemical plants and oil refineries and those kinds of things and that they burn off a lot of stuff and some of the stuff that they weren't supposed to do that	2752	B
somebody found out you know like in the middle of the night they would go ahead and do it anyway i think they got caught but i wonder how much of that kind of stuff you know goes on	2752	B
well- we have to uh we have to have a state inspection every year do y'all have that so which i i don't- i would assume-	2752	B
so i'm i'm assuming that you know they check they check everything for safety or	2752	B
but that's all they check for they don't check how good your- if your tires are good enough or your brakes are good enough or	2752	B
we do that every- every year	2752	B
well i'll have to check i'm not sure if if our state inspection every- once a year has to do you know if they check the	2752	B
uh	2752	B
emissions-	2752	B
oh i would i'm for anything that cleans up the air or the water or or or anything on that	2752	B
um-hum	2752	B
well and that's not necessarily the answer either because they found out that that's just comes out of somebody's tap so	2752	B
but a lot of these uh some of this well you know a lot of people have well water in fact in this area too and you know and uh	2752	B
if you don't get it tested you don't necessarily know what your what your drinking on i know- i know a lot of people you know have that and you know you have to wonder if that you know it could have an adverse effect on them too if they don't if they don't get it checked	2752	B
um-hum	2752	B
when we were when i was growing up i lived in Huntsville Alabama and their water supply came from uh	2752	B
spring and it was like ice cold spring water and i guess parts of the the city still have- you know get that but uh that was that was really wonderful it was really really good	2752	B
well what i consider invasion of well maybe it's just invasion of my private time is i- we get a lot of those computer generated uh telephone calls	2738	B
where they just you know go through the list and whenever you pick up the phone it's a recording and there you're supposed to hold on for a very important phone call and i feel that if it was so important that they would uh be there instead of putting me on hold	2738	B
yeah we uh i don't know why- why it is but there have been so many of those that um instead of the the sales- usual sales calls that you get that they um	2738	B
but will just run through the list and i guess wait for someone who's going to hang on to talk to them_1 but uh yeah then- we get a lot of those	2738	B
almost sort of like these TI phone calls no right right no these these are beneficial too too uh for personal uh benefit here so	2738	B
um-hum	2738	B
uh-huh	2738	B
right right	2738	B
swamp land in Florida	2738	B
yeah we get a lot for uh aluminum siding	2738	B
and uh but yeah what- do you all have what do you consider your invasion of privacy	2738	B
right right that seems to be the prime time they call is is definitely well between uh six and eight o'clock i guess	2738	B
um-hum	2738	B
right	2738	B
um-hum	2738	B
right i'm surprised they don't though uh i but i'm sure if they did that uh there would be a lot more uh	2738	B
public uh uh voice about it that uh we wouldn't go for that	2738	B
um-hum	2738	B
right and what's so bad about it is um and they don't i mean all it is is they just go through down a list of numbers i mean they don't know who they're calling it didn't seem like uh it they're just a haphazard um	2738	B
uh at it so i don't know	2738	B
right right	2738	B
uh no not yet	2738	B
uh-huh	2738	B
right	2738	B
that-	2738	B
now we've gotten several of those letters as far as trying to um sign us up for you know like you you've been uh approved for a pre you know for a credit card and all this and uh i've always wondered how	2738	B
and uh why now we had a problem not too long ago our	2738	B
uh my brother-in-law recently moved and uh somehow or another we- we got their new address on our credit reports because the uh	2738	B
i guess the credit card companies or whatever sort of keep up on some of them_1 and uh had uh picked up the new address and was sending all our bills over there	2738	B
so it was like okay now wait a second here so it'll be interesting to see how that works out how messed up things will be	2738	B
yup so that was a mess	2738	B
but uh yeah it the credit- there was a report not too long ago on the news here on uh	2738	B
they were going about how easily it was to get information about anyone and uh you know they got a credit history um you know went through all the moves that they made you know their uh	2738	B
it was just amazing the stuff that they got and it was so easily you know it was all public uh information it seemed like	2738	B
um-hum	2738	B
right	2738	B
uh-huh	2738	B
um-hum	2738	B
yeah we're in one of those counties and uh it uh you get lots of interesting things in the mail in Fort Bend County in southwest Houston the it seems to be the the up grown- you know the uh	2738	B
the uh new generation or whatever the up and coming people are all are moving out this direction and uh the new it's funny to see how the different stores are now changing uh to the um	2738	B
new demands and uh or trying to get the different uh people in	2738	B
and so uh but yeah i do you know you brought a good point about the um credit histories the credit reports that uh i feel is an can be an invasion of privacy if it's used wrong	2738	B
and uh should be so	2738	B
uh-huh	2738	B
um	2738	B
that's right because_1 isn't it uh about fifty dollars to get one oh is it oh okay i was thinking uh maybe i got some wrong information somewhere	2738	B
right	2738	B
but it it's difficult to change those or or easily to correct though oh	2738	B
right	2738	B
right	2738	B
oh i bet his wife was like okay come on what are you not telling me here right the second life here oh	2738	B
oh well i enjoyed talking to you and uh uh you i guess have a nice day thank you bye-bye	2738	B
have you run into any problems with invasion of privacy there	2738	A
um	2738	A
oh well that explains that i got one the other day they they did that uh it was a very important phone call from somewhere and they put me on a dead line for	2738	A
oh it must have been minutes and i said well it couldn't have been that important and i wound up hanging up and i've i've always wondered what that was	2738	A
um	2738	A
yeah you- you don't mind them	2738	A
no most of the people that are looking for me will try to get a hold of me at work that's about the only place they can pin me down	2738	A
and uh so about any important phone call that i have i'm going to get it at work and if the phone call comes to the house chances are it's either for my wife or one of the girls	2738	A
and so i just do not answer the phone call you know i'll let it ring until somebody else answers it and if they say dad it's for you	2738	A
i says what are they selling and i'd say ninety percent of the time if the calls for me at home it's somebody who wants to sell me some oil leases or some	2738	A
um	2738	A
i consider that to be the invasion of privacy particularly when i'm sitting down at the dinner table and they give me a call and i- i have to answer this phone to find out they're trying to sell me something and my dinner's getting cold	2738	A
yeah	2738	A
well i think for metropolitan areas they realize that most people work and that that probably the majority of people both husband and wife work and so there's nobody home except maybe school kids after school	2738	A
and so they might as well not even try you know not even tie up people dialing phone numbers except in the evening	2738	A
fortunately they have uh sufficient respect that they don't call after ten o'clock and they don't call before eight o'clock in the morning	2738	A
yeah	2738	A
yeah i think if i got a phone call at six o'clock in the morning it was somebody trying to sell me something i would call the phone company immediately and list them as a nuisance call	2738	A
yeah	2738	A
but i think that's about the biggest invasion of privacy we have uh there are a few others but uh i presume that they have legitimate purposes	2738	A
yeah the government seems to intervene quite a bit uh one of the other complaints i have is uh have you ever checked your credit with the credit bureau	2738	A
you ought to do that it's interesting that- to see who has inquired about your uh finances is uh they're required to keep track and for i think about the preceding year	2738	A
and it's interesting to see who has uh called and inquire about your credit there's quite a few companies that uh want to send you credit cards or uh or charge cards you know will ask for a uh credit dump and then	2738	A
send you a letter trying to get you to take their credit card open a charge account with some company	2738	A
yeah	2738	A
um	2738	A
yeah that takes some paperwork to get straightened out	2738	A
yeah	2738	A
um-hum	2738	A
well there are uh lists that go by zip codes	2738	A
and uh a lot of companies will target people for specific zip codes because of uh you know if you live in the Elton region or Great Falls area of Fairfax County or or Montgomery County in Maryland	2738	A
uh you're a prime candidate to be living in a rich house and uh and spend money on foolish things so uh that gets you on a mailing list for Jaguars and Rolls Royces and things like that	2738	A
yeah	2738	A
um-hum	2738	A
yeah	2738	A
um-hum well there was something on the news just this morning that uh somebody in doing their	2738	A
uh Master's dissertation or something of that nature uh did a study	2738	A
of uh credit card reports or or credit reports and they found that something like twenty percent of them have erroneous data in there	2738	A
uh data that would prevent that person from getting a loan in the future or or getting a credit advance and uh the information was erroneous	2738	A
so uh i- i think everybody recommends that uh well they've they the uh story this morning on the radio suggested you ought to do this about once a year but i figure about once every five years is good enough	2738	A
uh it's about five dollars yeah it's fairly cheap	2738	A
yeah well i had it done just to make sure that there wasn't any wrong information in there everything seemed to be all right	2738	A
well apparent apparently not not if you uh approach the people and and they're they're interested in keeping their records accurate	2738	A
but uh it's just nice to make sure that no uh	2738	A
uh strange records show up	2738	A
there was one case i think here recently where some fellow down in Southwestern Virginia uh wound up being arrested for uh failure to provide child support	2738	A
and he didn't have any children and he had a heck of a time convincing the authorities that he wasn't the the party that was responsible for failing to make child support payments	2738	A
yeah	2738	A
all righty	2738	A
thank you bye	2738	A
so have you got a pet	2770	B
yeah	2770	B
yeah	2770	B
that's right that's like unconditional affection	2770	B
yeah	2770	B
i had a cat i've had several cats my cat uh	2770	B
was hit by a car New Year's Eve but uh i'm gonna get another one as soon as i	2770	B
get back in town i'm going out of town this weekend when i get back i'm gonna find a cat	2770	B
so	2770	B
yeah	2770	B
yeah i work and go to school and it's kind of nice you know you come home your your pet's there for you and wants to wants a little food a little attention	2770	B
and that's it's kind of fun	2770	B
yeah	2770	B
no it was an indoor- kind of indoor outdoor it	2770	B
it was well yeah i don't i don't care for the smell of a litter box so my cat was trained to go outside other than that it was inside when it wanted to be it was outside when you know it	2770	B
yeah i- i- i think you know i like dogs but i think that uh i'm i'm kind of like big dogs- big dogs and you have to have room for them_1	2770	B
and dogs take a lot of	2770	B
a lot more care than cats do cats are pretty independent you know you feed them_1 and they keep themselves clean and	2770	B
if you if you raise them_1 right you know you don't have to worry about the litter box thing where with dogs you really do have to	2770	B
let them_1 out and take them_1 for walks and	2770	B
things like that	2770	B
yeah	2770	B
yeah	2770	B
i got to take care a friend of mine's dog he's just got a puppy and he was out of town last weekend and of course the dog is not trained for anything yet so it's go over there and clean up after the dog and	2770	B
that's that's a major chore you know if you don't	2770	B
if you don't keep up with it and uh kids kind of they want the they want the fun part and not the not the work	2770	B
yeah	2770	B
well if you're if you're gonna have a pet and not have it neutered or spayed you need to be willing to you know deal with the consequences take care of the offspring and	2770	B
and i think you know when i was growing up we had cats- cats	2770	B
and you know just seeing the cats you know the the the miracle of birth you know put that in quotes is that's a that's a neat thing to to experience as a kid and understand and and it was a real positive thing but on the other hand you don't wanna	2770	B
you'd be one of these people that dumps the kittens off on the side of the road you know they're they're they're getting old now and it's time to get rid of them_1 so	2770	B
yeah	2770	B
okay well it's good talking to you yeah bye	2770	B
no i don't my kids would love a pet i had a pet when i was a girl i had a Cocker Spaniel	2770	A
and i think one thing about pets is they're a lot of company you can you can tell them_1 anything and they won't tell anybody	2770	A
right as a matter of fact i was thinking that same thing unconditional love they just give it and don't expect too much anyway do you have a pet	2770	A
oh	2770	A
oh i'm so sorry but that's good that you're gonna get another one i know some of my friends who have pets uh and they just are really	2770	A
you know the ones who have dogs are very uh protective of them and i think that's one reason they have them especially older people that i know that have pets but they just um	2770	A
really take care of them_1 are and are protective of them	2770	A
yeah and and like my kids um they really want a dog badly	2770	A
and they've been looking and looking and want you know they'd take anything i think but um i don't know do you like i guess your cat was an indoor cat	2770	A
a kind of traveled around traveled	2770	A
yeah when i had a Cocker Spaniel it- it was an outdoor dog and uh i think i liked that better uh-huh	2770	A
yeah that's true	2770	A
yeah that's true	2770	A
take them_1 for walks right	2770	A
yeah i see all the people on on Sunday going for a walk with their dogs and	2770	A
um-hum	2770	A
oh that's exciting	2770	A
yeah	2770	A
yeah i think it's really important to that that if you get a pet that they're either spayed or neutered so that you know we're not just	2770	A
going on with this pet population and having to just get rid of them that that kind of gripes on me some but	2770	A
but i don't know more and more people are aware	2770	A
right right	2770	A
but uh	2770	A
i think that's really true	2770	A
yeah	2770	A
yeah exactly exactly i think our community is a lot more conscious now though too and and that's good too	2770	A
well i think that's all i have to say okay have a good night all right bye-bye	2770	A
my daughter this week uh	2786	B
as part of a uh in her high school Humanities- Humanities course she has been taking a little sub course that was offered where they actually write off you know and request their um	2786	B
preferred college they had to write to a minimum of	2786	B
three preferably five	2786	B
and i think she did four and they actually had typed little letters requesting you know catalogs and what not and figure up mileage expenses and	2786	B
trips home and	2786	B
they had to figure one airline	2786	B
uh trip home and at least one car trip home	2786	B
per year and gosh you know	2786	B
uh-huh	2786	B
have your kids gone to state schools	2786	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2786	B
yeah	2786	B
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh	2786	B
yeah yeah	2786	B
my folks kind of had a an unwritten rule there were nine of us and	2786	B
we got virtually no help if we went out of state we got a lot more help from them um and kind of the premise being that um if you	2786	B
you know part of college is being far enough way that you can't come home and do you laundry and come home for all football games and	2786	B
that kind of thing so i think that that's was some of the focus although	2786	B
its just so expensive and you know this little exercise we did this week with out daughter we just cringed it just	2786	B
oh you know the chances of her being able to go her father's and i alma mater are pretty slim i'm afraid you know it uh	2786	B
and	2786	B
uh-huh	2786	B
i just really believe in dorms for at least the first year depending on the child but you know i	2786	B
and of course summer work and	2786	B
yeah	2786	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2786	B
and that's okay	2786	B
oh and some a lot of things just don't switch they just don't switch	2786	B
yeah	2786	B
that's really a very viable suggestion i haven't ever really thought of it like that although as you outlined it certainly makes perfect sense it just	2786	B
you know from from experience well it's	2786	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2786	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2786	B
so much less expensive and	2786	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2786	B
well the uh Collen County Community College that we have out here is just growing by leaps and bounds we have been so impressed with it and uh you know my husband and i both have taken advantage of some the continuing education	2786	B
uh programs through it and as a family we've you know been involved with some of the arts things and you know that it's provided	2786	B
i've been really impressed but there was just that little piece of me you know going back to my own experience of oh gosh you know if my kids go there i'll never get rid of them i mean they'll never going to be on their own how long am i gonna you know have kids in my house	2786	B
staying up till you know two or three in the morning	2786	B
that's right that's right	2786	B
yeah yeah that's	2786	B
well and you know i think if they know that they can't get home all the time then they they're more brave they know they are going to have to forge some new relationships and you know be	2786	B
able to make new friends and	2786	B
they don't just hold on to the old hobbies and old the old activities they're a little more adventurous you know and	2786	B
thoughtful uh-huh	2786	B
so that	2786	B
yeah yeah	2786	B
you it's nice to know well we always were	2786	B
we had a lot of family in the area extended family my husband and i both uh uh went to a church school and we didn't have our families there but we had extended families	2786	B
and um um	2786	B
uh-huh	2786	B
yeah yeah	2786	B
yeah me too	2786	B
and your grades really suffer	2786	B
um uh-huh	2786	B
and at that point did you almost say gee i'm gonna have to get out of this school to do that	2786	B
have you been sorry	2786	B
yep my uh	2786	B
yep	2786	B
yep i agree because	2786	B
i was just reading a thing in the uh this is off subject some what but in the Reader's Digest about uh	2786	B
athletes- pro athletes and that uh	2786	B
that gotten on to drugs you know and invariably it was ones that didn't have the confidence to	2786	B
well a thing that we had here just recently	2786	B
and i i really i forgot to cut the article out i was mad at myself that i didn't because i wanted to follow up on it	2786	B
but there was man here in the Plano school system who had	2786	B
who has the premise that our grades in the metroplex in in you know	2786	B
some of these you know Irving and and uh Richardson Lake Highlands and Plano i think were his target ones are inflated artificially inflated grades	2786	B
and he felt like those kids when they actually got in to college situations were not um	2786	B
able to pull the same	2786	B
okay	2786	A
that's probably a good idea	2786	A
all kinds of little	2786	A
like i said it's good that that if you visit at least four or five colleges before they even you know go to attend go down there and visit for the weekend they do have those programs where you can go down there	2786	A
uh well no uh actually uh my my daughter is quite young yet but uh i went to a state school uh and i find that overall they're probably much cheaper	2786	A
and the quality of education's probably i would say is not much different than what'd you get at you know most of your like A&M Texas and uh you know Vanderbilt some of those	2786	A
i think there are some difference but probably in size in in in capacity of classes and that sort of thing but all in all the education level probably just as good if you if you participate	2786	A
yeah	2786	A
yeah well i tell you what it it's expensive of course i worked my way through and uh i think that is a good idea in some cases except that now a days it's just so expensive	2786	A
well yeah it it it it can be cost prohibitive real quick you know i i wanna be able to at least i wanna pay my pay the tuition	2786	A
you know give her transportation if it's necessary and course i'd like her to live in the dorm if it's possible	2786	A
but i don't want her to have to work i i would i would i don't mind if she has a little part time job to earn just a little extra spending money that sort of thing	2786	A
and summer work and things like that unless she just tends to go all the way through but uh i don't want to to have her to feel financially you know burdened uh and not you know concentrate on studying and that sort of thing	2786	A
but uh i know like	2786	A
i guess probably one of the things that that i've i've learned is that to try and pick a college where they have at least three different degree plans that you would like as an alternative you start one you don't particularly like that one	2786	A
you have something to go through because_1 if you have to change colleges then you lose hours and then you have to go through all that uh preliminary uh applications yeah you know a lot of times you know people will go to a college when they get there they find out gosh i really don't like this at all	2786	A
and there's nothing there that they want other than that so they are faced with having to do all that and that can that can throw as much as a year out of your degree plan	2786	A
but uh that was one of the things that that i that i encountered uh so i i know yeah so and then also the other thing is going to a junior- to the junior college	2786	A
for at least two years to get all you preliminary courses your Math your English History Government all the things that that are time consuming uh and some of the course that you can take on television	2786	A
and get those out of the way before you even start a four year college because a lot of those course especially English and History	2786	A
well less expensive but not only that but a lot of those course they there're extremely difficult if you're starting out in a four year degree plan at a four year college	2786	A
they're extremely difficult and they go a little faster and and in junior college they go a little slower and you do learn you know a little bit more self paced and uh	2786	A
yeah	2786	A
well i think it's i think it's important that they do get away you know not necessarily so far that you can't get to them_1 but at least	2786	A
you know a hundred miles or or even two hundred miles where you can at least go down there on a on a like a month a one month basis or they can come home	2786	A
you know and it's not real expensive uh you know uh lot of times they can share rides coming back and forth if they you know have people in the local area that live near them but uh	2786	A
yeah	2786	A
you know none of did that we all stayed right close to home and of course i was married the whole time i was in school but uh but it was uh it was still one of those situations where mom and dad were still around if you needed them and uh	2786	A
you know not that i could really depend on them much but they were still there and you're not far enough	2786	A
uh-huh	2786	A
i know i guess probably one of the other things that i notice is that some of the colleges are very much	2786	A
uh encouraging you know the kids to participate in all the fraternities sororities and all the extra curricular activities	2786	A
much so because they they are money making things and they do support they do help support the school	2786	A
but i prefer colleges that don't stress that as the major focus	2786	A
uh i i'd rather them_1 go to the schools that focus on the on the academic part of it	2786	A
and that's a that's a that's a key now a days because_1 a lot of the college promote the partying and the and the sororities and things like that and and once you get hooked you know you can really get uh locked up in that stuff and your grades suffer	2786	A
they really do uh i got wrapped up in that of course i was in you know athletics and stuff like that but it got so time consuming it got to be to where	2786	A
i had to decide either i was gonna just quit all that mess and go study or or or you know just basically skin through	2786	A
uh well i quit i quit football- i quit football because i just uh figured that it's not worth it what am i going to do with this after i get out i'm not gonna go pro football	2786	A
uh i'm not good enough i faced the you know faced that up front and say you know i'd rather get my grades	2786	A
and that's what i did i quit and went after after the grades	2786	A
no not at all so it	2786	A
uh but	2786	A
but you know you a lot of kids get hurt and then they they when they can't play pro ball anyway and then they don't have the education they should have what are they gonna do	2786	A
and that's that's a that's a big thing right now that you that you're seeing is the athletics the a lot of them are playing before they even can finish college	2786	A
they're playing pro ball i think it ought to be be a prerequisite that they ought to have a degree with a certain amount of grade point average before they are even eligible for pro ball	2786	A
but they don't they wont do that	2786	A
uh-huh	2786	A
yeah well i know it's- it's getting down to	2786	A
it's getting down to grade school now i think they really need to get away from you know from stressing the athletics and extra curricular activities and get even at the young age get	2786	A
get the politics and the money out of the athletics	2786	A
and start getting back in the school	2786	A
uh-huh	2786	A
hi this is Judy i'm from Maryland and i'm in California visiting right now	2767	A
oh	2767	A
okay	2767	A
okay	2767	A
okay	2767	A
well actually that's what i was thinking too	2767	A
and um you know just to jump ahead a little bit but then we can back up is it perhaps women in politics is for the future	2767	A
because_1 i don't see that really yet	2767	A
in positions of power really	2767	A
ah	2767	A
that's true that's true	2767	A
um do you work in private corporation or government	2767	A
ah	2767	A
um-hum um-hum	2767	A
oh are you that's the best status yes um i don't i see um in	2767	A
a government	2767	A
and i work in academia before	2767	A
and um actually there's one um woman in our i don't know what you'd call it uh institute who is a manager and i mean in a sense	2767	A
perhaps um	2767	A
a lot of she gets protected a lot because uh it's almost like a token	2767	A
and and it's sort of unfortunate	2767	A
because i think that they don't accept her technically and but she's a good paper pusher	2767	A
and it's in a technical position really	2767	A
and you know she should be more technical for what she does	2767	A
um but um	2767	A
you know i don't know and and teaching i still see that that's where most of the women are	2767	A
in teaching and you know and it's always been that way	2767	A
right not well	2767	A
uh-huh	2767	A
um-hum not department chairmen	2767	A
yeah not the deans and things like that	2767	A
um-hum um-hum	2767	A
hum	2767	A
and do you think it's because women aren't qualified or or just don't or don't want the job or just aren't hired for the jobs	2767	A
uh-huh	2767	A
they're just not selected somehow	2767	A
um-hum	2767	A
um-hum	2767	A
uh-huh	2767	A
oh okay but i'm wondering how many women actually major in engineering actually- but you know i say that but yet i know two	2767	A
yeah i'm sure there are	2767	A
yeah	2767	A
um-hum	2767	A
yeah i mean the two that i know obviously are not in teaching but um	2767	A
it's it i suppose in a since i was surprised when they told me they majored- majored in engineering i don't know why i but i don't know that many men that have majored in engineering either	2767	A
i mean it's just because i'm in the humanities it's just	2767	A
you know it's not not something that i tend to hear about	2767	A
but um	2767	A
yeah it's uh	2767	A
oh that's interesting	2767	A
yeah	2767	A
yeah i mean i- i suppose that that it's difficult to really say why because	2767	A
you know there there probably are a limited number of women who are interested in the subject and well qualified	2767	A
and maybe there aren't you know	2767	A
maybe they don't apply for the job	2767	A
right right which could be you know partial partially cultural anyway	2767	A
so that it might be circularly being the same problem of of expecting not to get hired for the good jobs anyway so why spend your time getting qualified	2767	A
it's a it's a rough	2767	A
it's a rough a rough situation	2767	A
um	2767	A
and i guess what i what amazes- amazes me is	2767	A
the number of men who are willing to stay home with the kids or and in our case we actually have one father who works part-time a six hour day so that he can take the kids	2767	A
kids or kid i'm not sure to school in the morning and be home	2767	A
when the children or child comes home in the afternoon	2767	A
this is uh	2767	A
well see i don't know anything about the family but but yeah i would imagine she might	2767	A
um because he's	2767	A
you- you know he's a really nice guy but he did say that because he was in the humanities and he's now working in more of a technical situation that he had trouble finding a job	2767	A
so that maybe he you know maybe she was more qualified but still- but still it's interesting that you know he he's been doing this evidently for a a good number of years	2767	A
and but it's unusual	2767	A
uh-huh	2767	A
yeah i	2767	A
oh he was even before they had children	2767	A
oh now that that really is	2767	A
oh she was	2767	A
uh-huh	2767	A
uh-huh	2767	A
yeah i mean i think that would be it would it would strike one as strange if there's no reason for	2767	A
somebody to stay home that	2767	A
but but yet you know we have to think about that because if if she had opted to stay home we wouldn't have thought anything strange-	2767	A
so so we're carrying our own prejudice	2767	A
yeah oh gee i guess we can't win	2767	A
because yeah if if somebody does it and breaks tradition you're surprised but	2767	A
oh dear so so	2767	A
oh dear you know well i mean it it's an interesting topic yet i must say it's not one that i've given a great deal of of thought to but um	2767	A
in the past it's um	2767	A
one of those things that you know seems to happen	2767	A
i don't i don't feel for the most part that i've been discriminated against	2767	A
no i was a department chairman i don't- but i don't like administration	2767	A
so then i'm uh uh probably a poor example although you know i was an administrator and could still be i suppose	2767	A
uh-huh	2767	A
oh really	2767	A
you were you were more ambitious than they would let you be	2767	A
yeah	2767	A
yeah well i would	2767	A
uh	2767	A
oh jeez	2767	A
yeah actually in a since i suppose when i was hired into the government um at i was taken advantage of	2767	A
and and that's true that you know sometimes other people get get higher increments	2767	A
for you know even	2767	A
right	2767	A
right that's probably true i hadn't i hadn't thought about it because i do like what i do and i just sort of ignore the administrative part of it since i didn't like it when when i had to do it	2767	A
so i- i figure you know nobody must uh nobody must like it it must be a rotten job for everybody but i know some people thrive on it	2767	A
oh gee	2767	A
well	2767	A
since i don't have a whole lot more to say on the topic	2767	A
hi Judy this is Norma and i live in Virginia	2767	B
we got a great topic	2767	B
i guess we might as well	2767	B
okay	2767	B
let you start	2767	B
what changes uh i guess the biggest i don't know your age Judy but i in my lifetime the biggest is in	2767	B
more women working definitely	2767	B
yeah	2767	B
for the future- right yeah	2767	B
right i don't see them_1 in positions in power in corporations either not many	2767	B
i did work in government	2767	B
and before that i worked in a bank for eight years	2767	B
and now i'm retired	2767	B
which do you work in excuse me	2767	B
in government	2767	B
uh-huh	2767	B
oh	2767	B
uh-huh	2767	B
uh-huh	2767	B
right	2767	B
in teaching	2767	B
but not at the college level	2767	B
we live in a college town and i worked at the university for a while and there are there are woman there but they're not the high paid	2767	B
professors that the men are	2767	B
well they did have one woman dean but and i guess she she probably did very well but	2767	B
that's the minority	2767	B
uh i don't know how	2767	B
i think they're not selected	2767	B
and course	2767	B
at this university uh this it's a big engineering school	2767	B
and i don't think there are many women in the engineering college	2767	B
and that's where the high pay is	2767	B
quite an well i think there are more than there used to be	2767	B
but they may not go into teaching	2767	B
uh-huh	2767	B
uh-huh	2767	B
oh uh-huh	2767	B
yeah	2767	B
uh-huh	2767	B
well i met one one day that uh had just joined the faculty in agricultural engineering and that really surprised me	2767	B
uh-huh	2767	B
uh-huh	2767	B
i don't know i don't i don't know how many go on and get a PhD in engineering	2767	B
that could be that's true	2767	B
uh-huh	2767	B
that's right	2767	B
oh	2767	B
that's interesting	2767	B
is it uh was she the major wage earner i mean did she earn more money that he did or do you know	2767	B
oh uh-huh	2767	B
uh-huh	2767	B
i- i know one uh gal that's she's a CPA	2767	B
and her husband is a house husband	2767	B
and then they had a child and he he still was the house husband he's the one that was going to	2767	B
uh-huh even before that right	2767	B
she was a little perturbed about it at one time i don't know how she's moved away i don't know how it is now but i know uh	2767	B
we're we all went out one evening and	2767	B
after work and uh	2767	B
she was	2767	B
there was an underlying note that she was perturbed about it	2767	B
uh-huh	2767	B
i don't think there was a valid reason because her statement was	2767	B
i told him let's face it you're a house husband that's what your going that's what you'll always be	2767	B
she wouldn't have been that's right uh-huh that's right it would	2767	B
it wouldn't have been a downer	2767	B
uh-huh that's true	2767	B
huh-uh	2767	B
oh	2767	B
that's right	2767	B
i think maybe more men would like to be if they weren't put down so badly	2767	B
huh-uh	2767	B
no i don't	2767	B
how do you feel your career has gone	2767	B
you don't that's good	2767	B
oh	2767	B
uh-huh	2767	B
uh-huh i was discriminated against very definitely in banking	2767	B
it was terrible	2767	B
right and the money didn't go with the positions	2767	B
the promotion promotions came but there were there wasn't comparable pay for the responsibility	2767	B
and i was told you don't need as much pay as i have because your children are older than my children or your husband has a good job and	2767	B
i think-	2767	B
uh-huh	2767	B
uh-huh	2767	B
uh-huh	2767	B
i don't	2767	B
yes i have	2760	B
well i have a VCR and i've had to return it a couple of times because of the same part failure	2760	B
and uh	2760	B
it's still not getting a real good picture	2760	B
and after	2760	B
about three hundred dollars i think it's going to be worth it just to go ahead and get a new machine	2760	B
so	2760	B
well i didn't get the extended warranty it was out of warranty just barely so uh	2760	B
so how about you	2760	B
well i will agree with that we've had some run ins especially with buttons as soon as you get them home the buttons fall off after the first time and uh the threads on the inside of the garments	2760	B
seem like they're just they don't cut threads off they're just a wads of threads and stitching does come undone you know fairly soon and then the prices you pay for them are ridiculous	2760	B
not only that but they're no better than a lot of the the the	2760	B
non name brand stuff so	2760	B
well the Americans just haven't gotten the message yet that's one thing because i'm i'm the same way we i do own an American	2760	B
car well a truck but uh in trucks i think you're pretty safe but in cars i've not had an American car that i've been really pleased with	2760	B
one for gas mileage and two uh the reliability things falling off the inside uh you know frequent tune-ups every foreign car i've ever made i mean that i've ever bought i've i've loved it	2760	B
well clutches are something that you really can't judge i mean they they some go out faster than others and	2760	B
you know that's those kind of items like that wear items there's no way you can judge	2760	B
uh like brakes uh i we have a a Volvo and the brakes go out on it on about every fifteen thousand miles	2760	B
it's just inherent for that car but the the car is super	2760	B
i'd rather put the brakes on it and uh and have the the reliability in the car itself but uh	2760	B
for the most part it's been a good car we've had it for six years now	2760	B
well if you can see the transition what i'm beginning to see is that the Japanese cars and and even just foreign cars in as a whole are beginning to	2760	B
get larger but they're able to keep the gas mileage and the reliability whereas the US are beginning to scale down but the gas mileage doesn't improve drastically	2760	B
and that right there ought to tell them_1 something	2760	B
i know we have the technology but i think it's the the glut of the oil companies and and uh big business and the government	2760	B
in trying to control things that they shouldn't control and	2760	B
uh they're not controlling the things they should control	2760	B
so i think there's a there's a lot of things there to be said and	2760	B
uh i will continue to buy	2760	B
foreign cars if that's the most reliable product especially when i'm paying for it	2760	B
and i and i hate to have that attitude but i do	2760	B
oh i know i'm the same way with GM i won't buy a GM car	2760	B
yeah i like Ford trucks	2760	B
and then i like the foreign cars especially Honda i've had a Honda	2760	B
that i liked and uh i mean it was super car	2760	B
so i think you know	2760	B
well it's been a good truck so far it's only got a forty two thousand miles on it	2760	B
and so far so good	2760	B
i don't know what's going to happen when it gets another twenty or thirty thousand miles on it	2760	B
oh boy	2760	B
well trucks trucks keep they hold their value	2760	B
pretty much and and even used trucks are pretty expensive	2760	B
oh i can't i can certainly understand that i don't want any car payments either in fact when mine's paid off and	2760	B
our other one's paid off uh i don't want to get another car until they just both fall apart	2760	B
well it's it's just anymore they don't benefit you uh from the income tax stand point	2760	B
and uh of course we just can't afford to trade cars like that so	2760	B
we're just going to make it go as far as it can and then when we're forced to get one we will	2760	B
that's right	2760	B
which can be easily done these days	2760	B
where- where are you from	2760	B
Ohio and where are you now	2760	B
you're in Texas	2760	B
i was going to say because uh i was going to say if you're up in the in the northern countries the salt would be a big factor on i didn't know how much- how they take care of the warranty items when it comes down to corrosion and that sort of thing	2760	B
yeah	2760	B
uh from Coppell	2760	B
Plano	2760	B
no	2760	B
fact my brother lives in Plano	2760	B
uh-huh	2760	B
but	2760	B
i would i would certainly like to And i hope that that before it's too late they do get the message	2760	B
and i- i don't know i think a lot of it has to do with uh	2760	B
you know just the attitude of the	2760	B
all righty	2760	A
okay have you recently had to return anything	2760	A
okay tell me about it	2760	A
oh my goodness	2760	A
you mean it the warranty wasn't on it or	2760	A
oh	2760	A
gosh	2760	A
well i haven't had to return anything recently but i you know i feel i'm going to i'm on a portable phone i'm going to go closer to the station here uh	2760	A
i- i feel like things are are not made as well as they used to be i um just cause- you for instance clothing i you know i have two children and um	2760	A
we- we say- they they like nice clothing and i spend a lot of money on it and it just doesn't last and i mean i'm very careful to follow the washing instructions and do exactly	2760	A
what it says and it still- still it they still wear out very quickly uh i find things that are sewn very poorly uh they they come- come unhemmed or unstitched so easily	2760	A
right right	2760	A
um-hum	2760	A
they never cut him off	2760	A
oh i know it's really it's silly and and my i have teenagers and they	2760	A
they think they want a certain brand or a certain item well	2760	A
when you buy a brand name that's popular you're paying for the brand name and	2760	A
no	2760	A
exactly that's what i you know i'm saying that the you know if i'm paying for the name and i'm paying that much money it'd better be	2760	A
a quality product now i do there's there are some that i think are a little bit better	2760	A
and i and i've been real pleased with them and my kids are have enjoyed wearing them and they've lasted until they've outgrown them	2760	A
but uh the majority of things um don't last and they're just very inferior	2760	A
and you know i try i try to look at the labels and i try- i try to	2760	A
to buy things that are made in the USA because i think that's important and yet i find a lot of the the	2760	A
the homemade goods are are inferior and also with cars i um	2760	A
i- i bought a new car last summer and i shopped around for a long time i mean we went to a lot of different dealers and i wanted to buy an American car because i had had a Toyota and i really liked it but i felt like	2760	A
i needed to buy- buy something that was American made because- i felt i owed that well i just could not find an American made car that i felt	2760	A
was worthy of the price they wanted and um i ended up buying another	2760	A
i ended up buying a Nissan and i love it	2760	A
huh-uh	2760	A
uh-huh	2760	A
oh i know	2760	A
exactly	2760	A
uh-huh	2760	A
yeah and they're so much more solid they sound better when you're in them they feel you feel like you're	2760	A
in a car and not rattling around in something i you know i just i just am real pleased with the Nissan i had and i had a	2760	A
Subaru before the Toyota and i loved that it was just the best car i've ever had in fact i wanted to buy another- another one but i	2760	A
really it really what- didn't have what i wanted they didn't have the the type of family car i wanted but that car i had for five years and	2760	A
i never had one thing go wrong with it and it um	2760	A
only thing i had to have replaced was the clutch and i had to do that twice because it was my fault because i ride it all the time and uh so you know it wore out	2760	A
yeah	2760	A
no	2760	A
yeah that's true	2760	A
is that right	2760	A
oh i know i've heard great things	2760	A
yeah	2760	A
oh yes and it's a safe car too it's a good made car	2760	A
oh that's great well that the the Subaru i had when i sold it it still had the tires	2760	A
the factory tires on it and the factory battery one i mean that's how good it was i never had one trouble with the battery and which is amazing in five years i didn't have to get a new one and it worked perfectly	2760	A
and it was amazing the tires were um excellent and uh you know when i sold it it didn't have that many- it was low mileage- i didn't think i had like thirty seven thousand miles on it which is	2760	A
nowadays low but uh i got a good price on it it's got good resale value and it was really a good car	2760	A
and you know it it kind of is frightening i think that you're right American uh manufacturers still haven't got the the idea that that quality is important and that	2760	A
uh-huh	2760	A
yes	2760	A
right	2760	A
uh-huh	2760	A
you're right you're right	2760	A
oh yeah	2760	A
um-hum yes	2760	A
exactly	2760	A
that's right	2760	A
that's right because you	2760	A
well the thing is when you have to take your car in continually because it's not working and pay that much money in repair	2760	A
price- bills it's ridiculous i- i had a Plymouth that was just the worst car in the world and i mean everything that could go wrong with it went wrong with it i had it in to the dealership more than i had it out it was terrible and i got rid of it as fast as i could it was the most	2760	A
it was a lemon is what it was and uh you know i will never buy a Plymouth again simply because of that	2760	A
is that right	2760	A
um-hum	2760	A
oh i've heard good things about a Honda	2760	A
yeah my niece has one and she loves it too yeah	2760	A
but you really liked your Ford truck huh	2760	A
uh-huh	2760	A
yeah	2760	A
well i'm looking for a used truck for my son and it's it's really been hard because we i we just don't have that much money to spend-	2760	A
to spend he just turned sixteen uh you know i don't- i want to get an inexpensive truck a small one that um you know i only have to pay a couple of thousand or you know three thousand	2760	A
yeah	2760	A
yeah they are we did find a couple but um	2760	A
you know they just i wasn't real sure about them and uh so we- we kind of passed them up um this one guy is not	2760	A
is trying to make up my his mind whether he wants to sell his it's a Mitsubishi and it's an eighty five and he wants to sell it for about two thousand	2760	A
you know	2760	A
oh	2760	A
yeah yeah they're car payments are outrageous now	2760	A
oh that's right	2760	A
hum-um hum-um	2760	A
well that's why it's important to find a car that you don't have to keep taking in for repairs because if you're gonna keep it a long time	2760	A
are you i mean shoot- you don't want to spend thousands of dollars on repairs	2760	A
yes easily easily and you know that- another thing about	2760	A
not only about uh you know products but	2760	A
services you're not real sure of anymore you you take a car in and you think it's fixed or and and how do you know if they really even fixed it and and sometimes i wonder you know and it's kind of scary	2760	A
you just you're not sure	2760	A
i'm from- i'm originally from Ohio	2760	A
i'm in Texas	2760	A
um-hum yeah	2760	A
oh yeah	2760	A
yeah it's uh bad up there but i'm i've been in Texas like thirteen years now so	2760	A
what are what part of Texas are you from	2760	A
Coppell i'm from Plano	2760	A
really	2760	A
is that right oh well	2760	A
i don't have much more to say about things i- i feel the same way that you do though i think it things are you know need to get better and i think you need we need to have somehow more of a trust in in US made goods and it's sad that we don't but uh	2760	A
oh	2796	A
you don't have one	2796	A
i have a cat and a dog both	2796	A
yeah	2796	A
yeah	2796	A
no i have-	2796	A
i have a house that uh has a a fairly good sized yard and	2796	A
uh i also i'm here	2796	A
by at night by myself because_1 my husband works at night and	2796	A
so i- i wanted a dog for protection and we-	2796	A
and we got a Dalmatian	2796	A
yeah and he-	2796	A
he's wonderful because_1 uh	2796	A
he's really protective	2796	A
and uh that was probably our main reason for getting him but	2796	A
oh he loves the cat the dog- uh	2796	A
Sam our Dalmatian loves the cat but the cat just really doesn't care about the dog at all	2796	A
you know he'll slap at him and	2796	A
hiss at him and everything and the cat stays in	2796	A
all the time so	2796	A
that's a uh you know barrier there but yeah	2796	A
hm yeah it is	2796	A
friendship yeah	2796	A
yeah oh Sam is very loving if	2796	A
if one of us are out in the yard you know he wants to jump and play and lick a	2796	A
typical puppy type atmosphere although he's	2796	A
almost two years old but	2796	A
um	2796	A
yeah the cat is a lot of companionship	2796	A
he just he's real old and he kind of lays around just wants you pet him and and that kind of thing	2796	A
no not at all not at all	2796	A
no my mom has a cat though that does that	2796	A
and that's kind of weird we haven't figured that out yet	2796	A
yeah	2796	A
just intuition or something instinct in a way	2796	A
uh-huh	2796	A
yeah i've i've never had any the ones that you just mentioned i have had a rabbit	2796	A
it was pretty interesting and it was like a cat it stayed in the house all the time and it used a litter box	2796	A
so it had free run of the house	2796	A
uh not not to strangers not strangers at all matter of fact it would run and hide but after it got to know you it was funny because_1 it would jump up on the couch and sit right next to you you know and it kind of pants	2796	A
i didn't know a rabbit panted but they pant kind of like a dog	2796	A
and it's kind of funny because_1 you can just sit there and pet them_1 and	2796	A
my rabbit got real large i think he was thirteen pounds	2796	A
so he was really big that was kind of funny looking	2796	A
but he was a good guard	2796	A
yeah at he heard every little noise and you could tell when a car drove up or anything	2796	A
oh no no	2796	A
no i don't think so	2796	A
no nothing like that	2796	A
okay thanks bye-bye	2796	A
well i currently don't have a pet although uh i have in the past	2796	B
not right now we	2796	B
oh my gosh well you should have a lot to talk about then	2796	B
but uh well- no the place i live in is a little too small right now for uh for a pet i hate to hate to keep a dog or something like that and not have enough room for it to run around in so	2796	B
but uh i guess you don't have that problem at least with the cat	2796	B
um-hum	2796	B
i can imagine	2796	B
that's a pretty big dog	2796	B
that's a pretty dog though	2796	B
um-hum	2796	B
how's how's he like the cat or how's the cat like the dog i guess it	2796	B
uh-huh	2796	B
i guess it's a good reason to to have a pet then as protection i guess is one thing	2796	B
but uh i guess i they're a lot of company though yeah friendship they're an awful lot of company	2796	B
um-hum	2796	B
oh gee	2796	B
um-hum	2796	B
doesn't doesn't get too excited about anything	2796	B
he's not one of those cats that like to sit on top of the television is he	2796	B
um-hum	2796	B
yeah i've i've noticed how they get black cats it seems like they always wanna sit on top of the television set and let their tail only when when there's something you really want to see then they let their tail down in front of the TV set in front of the screen and uh	2796	B
they they just seem to know i guess	2796	B
but uh	2796	B
it it sounds like you have pretty normal pets though i guess uh you know a lot of people i mean i guess i've never cared for birds or fish or um or gerbils or anything like that but dogs and cats are about the only thing i think of when i think of pets	2796	B
um-hum	2796	B
um-hum	2796	B
yeah	2796	B
was it as was it as friendly as a cat or do you do you think you uh	2796	B
um-hum	2796	B
hm	2796	B
neither did i	2796	B
huh	2796	B
oh gee that is a big rabbit	2796	B
um-hum	2796	B
but uh was-	2796	B
was he	2796	B
but but he's not much protection i would imagine	2796	B
not- not not an attack rabbit or anything like that	2796	B
not real protective but uh	2796	B
well i- i guess that's about- to say about pets	2796	B
all right well very nice speaking to you bye-bye	2796	B
well i don't do anything with the lawn really but i do gardening both flowers and vegetable gardening	2785	B
um i we have enough property that we uh can have a little bit of a garden and that's fun well actually we've always had one even when we haven't had big yard because um we enjoy that we love fresh vegetables in the summer and	2785	B
it's just one of the things i enjoy doing	2785	B
so would i	2785	B
yes i do uh so i manage to fit in my gardening chores afterward i work for a school system so i'm able to do that um because_1 i get at- home a little earlier	2785	B
and i can still do some some sorts of things but	2785	B
oh absolutely	2785	B
wow	2785	B
oh that's wonderful	2785	B
but that's that's i mean you really feel you can accomplish something and to help other people too that's neat	2785	B
uh-huh	2785	B
right	2785	B
that's wonderful yeah	2785	B
yeah well i think it sounds good i've never belonged to a garden club because i've always been more interested in just doing what i can do my- on my own i've never had the time really to get involved in the organized	2785	B
sort of format but i know people who do it and and enjoy it very much	2785	B
oh	2785	B
my word	2785	B
for heaven's sake	2785	B
well um there aren't men's gardening clubs in this area that i know of they're they're women but um and usually they're the tea type things you know where they have a little luncheon and they do their thing but um flowers are primarily the emphasis	2785	B
um whereas i enjoy vegetable gardening almost more i do flowers sort of look pretty but i	2785	B
i really like to do the vegetables	2785	B
being what	2785	B
oh my well what a wonderful thing	2785	B
yes	2785	B
oh terrible yeah	2785	B
okay well uh the flowers i'm just in fact i was going to go out today to buy some plants so i could put them in i i always have geraniums and	2785	B
um and then i have a shady area that i need to uh be concerned about not getting something that has to have sun so i've discovered that uh impatiens that tried and true is turns out to be about the best thing to use there along with coleus	2785	B
because they uh look pretty and in my front garden uh but i like the vinca which is something i hadn't they look sort of like impatiens you know but they're not quite	2785	B
and they're better for the sun areas um and of course you know the mine are old very ordinary flowers marigolds and and that sort of thing	2785	B
in my	2785	B
no i don't i don't know maybe this climate is a little better	2785	B
um but in the vegetable garden we grow um	2785	B
usually well our favorite is something called white half runner green beans now that's	2785	B
well you know why because i grew up in North Carolina and that was my mother's um favorite bean she always- she always grows you know five different varieties but that's the kind that produces the best	2785	B
and and they're wonderful and i pick them when they're very young and have very little string and then just steam them_1 a little bit my mother picks them_1 when they're fat and she cooks them_1 for an hour with some fat back	2785	B
and they're good both ways	2785	B
yeah yeah	2785	B
oh in between the size wise yeah yeah	2785	B
well my mother doesn't think they have any flavor the way i cook them_1	2785	B
oh of course-	2785	B
yeah it is they're two different vegetables that way um-hum	2785	B
oh my gosh	2785	B
my does mother- mother will be thirty- ninety this year and she lives in western North Carolina and uh she would do that if uh if we didn't tell her that she'd better not	2785	B
but she doesn't have that big a garden but she has a bigger one than i do and i have four children you know so	2785	B
oh yes oh yes oh it is it's great it's it's really her joy and i guess- suppose that's why i enjoy gardening because you know growing up with it we also grow um yellow and green squash um much to my children's chagrin	2785	B
and uh we grow a lot of tomatoes uh there's just no replacement for fresh grown tomatoes	2785	B
so we enjoy that um we grow i i have been trying to grow watermelon and cantaloupe and get teased by my family but i actually was successful for the last two years so	2785	B
i'm going to do it again that's right and we grow broccoli	2785	B
and i have been	2785	B
very uh happy about the new way of controlling the the uh worm that gets in broccoli	2785	B
um Bacillus- by using the Bacillus thuringiansis which is the uh little well in fact that's what they use for gypsy moth i don't know if you have had that problem there or not	2785	B
but it's you know it's a problem that's that's moving south from from the New England area and they devastate the trees so they they spray the the government uh sprays um	2785	B
two- two three times in the spring when the uh caterpillars are are coming along because what they do this this uh Bacillus um the worms ingest it and it expands in their in their um	2785	B
digestive tract and they die	2785	B
so that's the same technique that is- you know for any of the other uh little varmints that get in vegetables so it that's really very nice because_1 it's a non-toxic way of of handling the problem	2785	B
so	2785	B
well it's nice hearing you talk and i'm i wish you uh good luck have you just recently moved to Charlotte	2785	B
oh so well that's not very long	2785	B
yes	2785	B
oh that's great that's great well i hope you have a an opportunity to garden again	2785	B
oh well good	2785	B
bye-bye	2785	B
okay uh we're going to talk about our lawn and garden- garden chores do you have either one	2785	A
do you	2785	A
oh really	2785	A
so do i i would i had rather be outside than inside any day	2785	A
do you work during the week uh outside the home	2785	A
uh-huh	2785	A
yes	2785	A
or you sneak out in the morning after daylight savings time starts and with your cup of coffee and see if it has grown overnight	2785	A
well i unfortunately am not gardening this year i love gardening in fact	2785	A
i was presented at like twenty- no about thirty years ago with a life membership uh from the Richmond Virginia counsel of uh garden clubs	2785	A
and it wasn't because i was so good but i organized a very large garden club but i still have uh	2785	A
it well it's always something that seems so odd to me but uh	2785	A
yes it had really nothing to do with uh actual gardening or flower arranging or anything like that it was just that i happened to organize this group that was about seventy people	2785	A
that isn't yeah that that those numbers were were great but it	2785	A
yes	2785	A
well and actually i think that most women's garden clubs that i've been aware of in the past	2785	A
uh are only flowers what i would like- we've spent the last twenty years in Oklahoma just moved to to North Carolina	2785	A
and uh we were originally- originally of course from this area from Virginia but uh	2785	A
in North uh in Oklahoma it's the men's garden clubs that i would have wanted to join	2785	A
and you would have because they do all kinds of uh gardening and not just flowers like women do um-hum um-hum	2785	A
um-hum	2785	A
yes i think so too	2785	A
yes and- and i have spent the last ten ten years being a florist	2785	A
being a florist	2785	A
it was nice it was exhilarating uh for many years uh many of those ten	2785	A
until the last couple when uh we had such an economic slowdown	2785	A
yeah well tell me what's in your garden this year since i don't have one	2785	A
um-hum	2785	A
um	2785	A
um-hum	2785	A
yes do you have trouble with uh red spider on marigolds	2785	A
maybe it's	2785	A
yes um-hum um-hum	2785	A
well- do you isn't that funny so is my favorite	2785	A
okay	2785	A
yeah	2785	A
yeah well i think it has the best flavor	2785	A
yes uh-huh well i like them in between i like them in between	2785	A
the flavor is better i think in between	2785	A
yes yeah um-hum my mother	2785	A
well and i no i love them well that's the yankee way but i think that's like another vegetable i love them that way just the thrill of	2785	A
um-hum um-hum in fact i my mother who is eighty six years old canned over a hundred quarts of half runners last year	2785	A
yes um-hum yes	2785	A
really- yes	2785	A
and she tends to it herself uh-huh isn't that wonderful	2785	A
i think so too	2785	A
yeah	2785	A
uh-huh	2785	A
right	2785	A
uh-huh	2785	A
no	2785	A
wonderful bet you showed them	2785	A
oh	2785	A
no	2785	A
yes	2785	A
um-hum	2785	A
great well we could chat- we could really talk gardening a long time i'm enjoying hearing you so much	2785	A
um	2785	A
yes- uh no October uh so yes recently seven months and it the weather is wonderful i love it it's just terrific you know rains a little too often	2785	A
oh i think so- i have a little spinach	2785	A
bye-bye	2785	A
about how many calls have you made on this system	2723	A
oh okay yeah	2723	A
i uh i only started doing it after uh i started getting calls and said oh heck that's right i'm supposed to make a few calls so i started	2723	A
about month ago and i this is getting close to twenty here which i think is about all	2723	A
uh our little gift book goes up to but i don't really know	2723	A
i've got about twelve tickets in the mail do you have you've a few	2723	A
okay uh medical go ahead i'm i'm medical that's mine	2723	A
yeah i i'm benefits go ahead you first	2723	A
um-hum	2723	A
oh yeah	2723	A
the one it's kind of like uh automobile insurance the ones uh that i think are the highest and important to me	2723	A
uh i hope i never have to use them really per se although i've used medical a little bit uh	2723	A
that well that one certainly is high i i worry that it's weakening rather than strengthening so i like to reverse that trend and say i'd like to get those to strengthen you know be better and better	2723	A
then salary- salary- salary continuance i've never used that one i hope i never will but that's kind of like an insurance thing i sure like that one	2723	A
that's like automobile insurance you never want to get in an accident but it you like to have it there	2723	A
um-hum	2723	A
right	2723	A
with TI or somebody else	2723	A
uh-huh	2723	A
oh right yeah	2723	A
um-hum	2723	A
yeah	2723	A
right	2723	A
and outside consultants didn't they have an outside consultant too	2723	A
did they have an outside consultant like a	2723	A
the employee-	2723	A
yeah	2723	A
right	2723	A
oh really	2723	A
yeah they seem to be doing- doing a good job of that i'm in facilities and- and our organization built builds those facilities over in Park Central now	2723	A
and i guess they've been using them for six months now and i've known several engineers that got laid off and they said	2723	A
it's like getting a PhD almost they the much they learn over there you know after they've been laid off uh one engineer said it was really an education he he just learned like you he said	2723	A
he learned a tremendous amount that he never would have able to pick up on his own he was very thankful for that too	2723	A
to have an office yeah	2723	A
yeah well he said he learned so much and how he thought he thought he had a PhD in how to get a job after he was through the whole process for for several months he did eventually get a job	2723	A
yeah apparently it's very sophisticated and i guess it may be one of the best uh that anyone's doing	2723	A
right you're absolutely right that's a good one	2723	A
what do you think about pensions anything on that or	2723	A
yeah	2723	A
um-hum	2723	A
right	2723	A
what do you think of a pension that goes from one company to the other like an account like a 401K- account i i've been thinking about that for years uh	2723	A
i know that's what i'm saying that that pensions you see just like you were you're saying you've only got uh so many years say you work for two three companies if you take your pension with you after you're vested	2723	A
and then just add the money together like you do with a 401K- account you know	2723	A
uh it's your account period it doesn't matter where you go or anything that's your account to roll over	2723	A
no no there isn't i i'm saying that's the question what do you think could be better and i'm saying that pensions say in the year two thousand or more when social security goes away which it probably will	2723	A
i think they ought to have a pension at least that you'd never lose you work for a company seven years	2723	A
uh well social security's going to go to way i think and you can or you can invest your own money you have no control over your social security and it's not paid for by the current	2723	A
like when say we retire after the year two thousand	2723	A
social security's paid for by the twenty five year olds you know they may rebel	2723	A
and you won't have any social security where if your money was in your account i mean you can never lose it it's there you don't have to depend on anybody to be putting that money in for you you know	2723	A
that's just a thought i mean i	2723	A
if they say which	2723	A
yeah	2723	A
yeah and instead of having a a socialized pension it just would be really money that you and your company maybe you had to put some money in it too i don't really know	2723	A
but i i can see where they'd need to do something on that because	2723	A
the statistics are you don't work for a company twenty years through no fault of your own you know	2723	A
you work for five six seven and you- you- a lot of people i know guys	2723	A
yeah i have too but not not quite that often but uh yeah i've only got uh	2723	A
i've got fourteen now here at TI and i hope to make twenty five but say if something happened to me i mean	2723	A
you know they lay me off uh you have a pension but then you'd have to try to get a pension in another one it would be nice if they could get them together	2723	A
i do worry about medical though again knock wood that uh	2723	A
i haven't used it i guess you i'm sorry you really do use it throughout the year because you get your teeth fixed and all that i mean i but i'm not i'm talking about major items i haven't used it for anything major	2723	A
i'm glad it's there though	2723	A
yeah	2723	A
i have the regular i again i just- i haven't i can't complain about it because i haven't used it and every time i needed it it it's uh it's uh you know	2723	A
fallen right in line for the the minor things i guess i'm the one just supporting most of the others	2723	A
uh yeah yeah i think it's two seventy five for a family but the dental is right away if you exams uh	2723	A
okay yeah the medical you have to have a deductible	2723	A
yeah right	2723	A
well drugs are okay now i'm on that uh	2723	A
plan where i take blood pressure medicine if you take an allergy medicine so anything you need a prescription for for more than six months you get it for used to be six bucks they just raised it to twelve	2723	A
yeah that's a typical that's a typical one that's in there	2723	A
the forms are right in personnel	2723	A
fact you may be able to take care of take advantage of that it's through Baxter Labs	2723	A
uh	2723	A
well maybe you still can do that do you do you buy your pills one at a time	2723	A
well turn turn in your forms go right to personnel i don't know whether you have to about an HMO i don't think so	2723	A
you turn you get your doctor to give you a more than six months prescription	2723	A
and uh they're twelve dollars again they just were six they just raised them to twelve this year	2723	A
twelve dollars for a three months supply	2723	A
or whatever whatever the the amount is uh i don't want to say three months but	2723	A
it's a lot cheaper allergy medicine's really uh expensive and that blood pressure medicine is fairly expensive i take two	2723	A
go right to personnel they got the forms in personnel and maybe i maybe i've told you go something that you didn't know about in benefits there	2723	A
i do it yeah i you know it's a very common thing	2723	A
it's through Baxter Labs tell yeah	2723	A
yeah	2723	A
what else i'm sure we're getting close to our five minutes whatever here	2723	A
what other benefits	2723	A
yeah the salary continuation i think that's a great one but again a hope i never use that one that means you're really sick if you have to use that one	2723	A
i'm satisfied with the vacation i don't know what else you know you nice to say you get another week	2723	A
and when i'm well i only got fourteen years so i'll get another week when i hit fifteen	2723	A
so that's that's fair i mean it's reasonable if four weeks is a lot i think	2723	A
i know some people who have twenty five years and thirty and they want more but uh you know	2723	A
uh	2723	A
um-hum	2723	A
well the way things go i think i'm going to have to work till i'm seventy five whether i quit and uh uh or when i retire get a part-time job	2723	A
uh i've originated only a a few	2723	B
but i've received quite a few	2723	B
uh-huh	2723	B
oh yeah	2723	B
yeah i've been getting mine	2723	B
uh you pushed the record button we're supposed to be discussing the subject	2723	B
yeah uh well i'll tell you i've	2723	B
been around for quite a few years and worked for a lot of different companies and uh it's hard to beat any of the benefits that or salaries either	2723	B
that we get from TI i'm quite pleased with it	2723	B
course there's a few things that uh i think i could do better if i was sitting up in the CEO's seat but um	2723	B
i think Jerry's doing a pretty good job as it goes	2723	B
uh-huh	2723	B
well	2723	B
ah yes	2723	B
um-hum	2723	B
well uh	2723	B
like i say i worked for several different companies and there's nothing to compare with uh TI here	2723	B
now i really got caught up back in eighty five i got caught up in the oil layoff	2723	B
uh i wasn't with GSI but i was connected with uh	2723	B
uh oil	2723	B
uh exploration	2723	B
no with TI	2723	B
but i say i wasn't connected with GSI	2723	B
and i got caught up in a layoff now	2723	B
uh course you get six months	2723	B
uh unemployment from the state	2723	B
but what TI did for us is is uh i i've never heard of it before	2723	B
they fixed us up with an office with uh telephones access to long distance	2723	B
uh computers	2723	B
a secretary to take messages for us or type uh letters for us	2723	B
uh they had out of town newspapers	2723	B
and then the company-	2723	B
i beg your pardon	2723	B
uh yes they they did have uh seminars every once in a while	2723	B
uh cause that was not uh restricted just to just us	2723	B
but the most important thing was that uh they had	2723	B
made up the difference between	2723	B
uh unemployment pay and seventy five percent of my net pay	2723	B
and they then TI paid me that	2723	B
so uh i was able to uh not just exist i mean i i lived just as comfortably as i did before i was laid off	2723	B
uh-huh	2723	B
well this was not a learning thing by any means it was just a uh	2723	B
uh an assistance trying to find another job	2723	B
oh uh-huh	2723	B
well course i went through this uh what about five years ago they may have improved it considerably	2723	B
well that's one of those little uh	2723	B
uh little extras that you don't see in the uh the the the handbook you know	2723	B
it	2723	B
well now i have uh uh i'm getting close to retirement	2723	B
and of course i've been looking into it but uh	2723	B
since i'm only a yellow badger i won't be getting a whole heck of a lot from TI as far as retirement is concerned	2723	B
i've never heard of such a thing	2723	B
um-hum	2723	B
uh yeah	2723	B
i that that sounds like a hell of an idea i didn't know there was such a thing	2723	B
yes by all means well what would be the difference between that and social security	2723	B
yeah yeah	2723	B
uh-huh no i i like the idea course that's that's some something like an IRA	2723	B
uh-huh	2723	B
yeah that that's what i've done i i've bounced around about every ten years i change	2723	B
um-hum	2723	B
uh-huh	2723	B
well knock wood i haven't used mine anything- for anything major just doctor visits and	2723	B
well i i have the uh the Homa i use Homa	2723	B
and i like that uh a lot better than Aetna	2723	B
uh-huh	2723	B
well doesn't it work that you don't see uh uh anything until you spend the minimum	2723	B
don't you have to spend the minimum of two three hundred	2723	B
yeah well now i have the same dental you have	2723	B
uh-huh now see i don't have a deductible	2723	B
i pay a straight five dollars for anything a doctor visit or drugs	2723	B
oh that one i haven't heard about	2723	B
uh-huh	2723	B
yeah i have high blood pressure problems myself	2723	B
every- thirty days at a time	2723	B
hum	2723	B
uh-huh	2723	B
um	2723	B
yeah	2723	B
yeah i just might do that	2723	B
well thanks thanks for the tip Jim i i shall look into it	2723	B
yeah	2723	B
uh let's see we discussed uh uh medical and dental	2723	B
uh retirement	2723	B
uh-huh	2723	B
what about vacation	2723	B
uh	2723	B
uh yeah that's right	2723	B
um-hum	2723	B
well i'm uh i'm here i've got just eleven years	2723	B
and i don't think i'll ever see a a silver badge i won't i won't be around that long	2723	B
well i i've lived overseas you know it's with in the Army and i see what kind of taxes they pay in other countries	2795	B
it just seems as if	2795	B
from the time i've been following politics which was i guess about seventy five really got interested in politics and keeping up with it	2795	B
it just seems since that time the bureaucratic machine has just gotten so out of control	2795	B
and then they scream about that	2795	B
that or the uh politicians scream about they're going to try and not raise taxes but they vote in a raise for themselves every year	2795	B
i i have trouble understanding the entire concept of foreign i understand going into countries where they've had natural disasters	2795	B
and going in and giving relief aid that way	2795	B
but paying for their these countries to run their own governments	2795	B
i i've got a big hang-up with that	2795	B
it just seems like they keep saying we're helping this country or we're helping that country out	2795	B
wouldn't our money be better spent helping here at at home	2795	B
that's something i would and that subject in itself i'd love to see that entire thing revised	2795	B
something's got to change	2795	B
you know and turn drastically	2795	B
well we've got	2795	B
it's not like this country doesn't have the people with the knowledge we've got it	2795	B
we've got people that are willing to make change	2795	B
but as long as you've got career politicians that spend twenty five to forty five years in Washington	2795	B
playing power broker they're not going to do anything to tap- tap out the well	2795	B
now that's something i would love to see happen not only in all the states but in the federal legislatures too	2795	B
two terms then they got to sit out one	2795	B
and i think	2795	B
the thing about the ones that are really up there doing what they were elected to do it doesn't matter if they're in that office or not if they have to sit out a term fine they're going to be able to do things behind the scenes	2795	B
either in the capacity of the lobbyist or in	2795	B
working within their party of of the state or national level to get things enacted	2795	B
that's not going to slow them down at all	2795	B
i think compared to the other systems that are out there without a doubt we've got probably the best system it just needs some fine tuning	2795	B
well the question is who- who's ready to put their hand on the first wrench and tighten the first bolt	2795	B
trying to get	2795	B
the um	2795	B
politicians to actually truthfully	2795	B
report what they did vote for what they didn't vote for when they were actually on the floor at their desk	2795	B
is almost is going to be impossible to do	2795	B
there is no accountability of them	2795	B
at any given time if you've been to Washington	2795	B
the basic question is too much	2795	A
and	2795	A
i don't know my my opinion i guess here in North Carolina they announced that May second was the uh tax day that's when you everything you've earned so far has gone to taxes	2795	A
the rest of the year is yours	2795	A
that represents about a third of your income	2795	A
and i don't know uh who came up with that figure but i think it really comes out to be more than the third	2795	A
but uh i i don't know i find myself in a position sort of like selective	2795	A
approval almost like the United Way campaign where you agree with most of the agencies but uh don't agree with some of them	2795	A
and	2795	A
i think that we could have less tax	2795	A
by cutting out some of the	2795	A
the uh	2795	A
programs that we support	2795	A
but overall i guess we're pretty fortunate nature nation as far as the amount of tax that we have to pay how do you feel	2795	A
yeah i've done some business overseas in in Latin America and of course know about the we hear about Sweden with their	2795	A
uh social program but you don't hear what the cost is same in Europe- in Britain and other nations much higher tax rates	2795	A
but the	2795	A
oh yes	2795	A
oh yes that that's the uh the type of thing that really irritates me where they can get significant increases when everyone else is facing layoffs or or cutbacks or	2795	A
uh equating it to a personal income situation	2795	A
and yet it's almost automatic or it's hidden and	2795	A
uh i think they need to bite the same bullet that most individuals do	2795	A
the one of the other problems that i have recently is	2795	A
centered on such things as the trip by Dan Quayle to Augusta Georgia to play golf	2795	A
and i realize that constant communication is necessary	2795	A
especially when Bush had his uh	2795	A
heart rhythm problem this weekend but	2795	A
we can always send jets for someone i think if if they're out of pocket	2795	A
rather than accepting it as the norm for a nice golfing trip	2795	A
so that's what i meant about the selectives some things i think we're doing extremely wrong could save a lot of money	2795	A
but other things uh	2795	A
like i enjoy seeing money spent on the Smithsonian Institute in Washington i think it's one of the nicest national treasures and i love to see	2795	A
kids of uh any background roaming through and seeing such great collections	2795	A
but	2795	A
then when when we talk about all the foreign aid that we give away	2795	A
that bothers me a lot	2795	A
i don't know how to solve the problem though when as you said the uh bureaucracy gets out of hand regardless of who you vote for	2795	A
the bureaucracy continues too	2795	A
uh-huh	2795	A
oh i think it's way	2795	A
it's way out of hand i'm almost turning into an isolationist	2795	A
which is not not a good attitude in in global uh communications and everything that we have this these days but it's a matter of uh	2795	A
i hate to see money thrown away and that's what i really- i equate to some of our foreign aid policies	2795	A
and they	2795	A
i agree i think that's	2795	A
i have some problem with social programs at home in terms of making it too convenient to be on on welfare	2795	A
oh yeah yeah i i think when you get to a point where it's more economical to stay on welfare than it is to get a job you've got a basic concept problem	2795	A
yeah	2795	A
but i i think uh if we're going to waste money i'd almost see rather see us waste it at home	2795	A
than overseas too and that there's some unusual	2795	A
things which can occur in the foreign aid uh	2795	A
by a stroke of a pen i think our president can forgive foreign debt and that's a lot of power vested in one	2795	A
one person in our system of uh	2795	A
governance	2795	A
and i've seen that happen	2795	A
over the last few years and you and i are paying for it	2795	A
but Jim it comes back a lot to the same thing that you said initially you've been overseas and have seen	2795	A
other places	2795	A
and i guess we're still fortunate but i think we're just- i just want us to be smarter	2795	A
than we are	2795	A
uh-huh	2795	A
yeah well your your neighbor to the north Oklahoma just voted for state legislators uh one term	2795	A
no let's see	2795	A
i forget was it one term or two term	2795	A
fixed	2795	A
uh incumbency in other words they can't be reelected- reelected after	2795	A
i think maybe the second term	2795	A
federal	2795	A
yeah	2795	A
yeah i think it takes away the issue of of a lot of the uh special lobbyist groups and everything else	2795	A
creating the incumbent uh	2795	A
about	2795	A
invincibility- invincibility	2795	A
but	2795	A
there's another problem with that i'd we've got some good ones and i hate to see them leave	2795	A
but it i guess it's hard to to really uh	2795	A
identify which are the good and which are the bad	2795	A
the electorate seems to be putting them all back in	2795	A
and i thought this last election would be different but it it turned out it really wasn't	2795	A
uh-huh	2795	A
uh it doesn't solve the non elected bureaucrats- bureaucrats either that's	2795	A
that's an issue i think that really fits into it because there are a lot of people that sit	2795	A
in the same position and really don't give a hoot who gets elected	2795	A
they still kind of run the show and and setup all the roadblocks and the	2795	A
the uh	2795	A
horrendous regulations and everything else	2795	A
but it's uh	2795	A
it's our system i think now we have to figure out how to really manage it well	2795	A
uh-huh uh-huh i think that's right	2795	A
well	2795	A
yeah How do you feel about the information we get uh	2795	A
from Congress that that affects us as far as the uh	2795	A
knowledge to to elect the right people	2795	A
i have i have a real problem federal register for instance	2795	A
uh you can have almost put anything in there you want to	2795	A
no it's not in the federal register what's the uh the congressional record	2795	A
uh someone can put in information retroactively to that to show that they supported something or uh	2795	A
yeah it	2795	A
and	2795	A
all right i guess our i- we're in the process of a home repair right at this point because we're we're painting the outside of our house	2774	A
i don't know i guess that's you would consider that a home repair certainly uh	2774	A
uh and interesting enough this time we're changing the color which makes uh an addition uh we've what does your most recent	2774	A
you did that recently too huh make- does it make a big difference	2774	A
that's neat isn't it nah	2774	A
i was really uh really tired of the color and it's it's it's helping we're not quite through but it's it really is looking good	2774	A
uh we went through a process of of uh home repairs on a on a rental house we had probably the most uh extensive and uh the interesting part of it was how much we learned about what we could do	2774	A
um didn't have very much money and so we had to to do it ourselves in a kind of a slow process but we learned how to do	2774	A
uh retile bathtubs and and um	2774	A
oh just all kinds of things that are kind of unusual	2774	A
ah	2774	A
yeah	2774	A
um-hum	2774	A
it's nice to not have a drip through from the ceiling- from the roof isn't it	2774	A
that's awful um uh Howard and i were talking about home repair the other night in uh in connection with Scouting you got a Scouter uh coming up and uh	2774	A
uh i think it's neat for for young people to learn how to uh take care of their	2774	A
of of a household you know like uh fixing faucets and drippy faucets and putting in panes of glass and stuff like that	2774	A
um-hum	2774	A
how did the how did the paneling- paneling looks lots better do you do you like it better	2774	A
yeah	2774	A
yeah yeah-	2774	A
yeah that's nice isn't it	2774	A
nice to have it come out to uh uh positive and look look good	2774	A
yeah well we have a lot that needs to be done we have uh we have uh carpeting and and uh we did have a a new uh floor put in our kitchen and um	2774	A
i have my mother living with us and so she was in a	2774	A
a room with a carpet and course she's quite aged she's ninety three now so that meant she had problems now and then and it- it was really good to get the carpet out of there and put a a linoleum down so it was easier to clean and	2774	A
see where the dirt was and so that was a really positive uh uh	2774	A
it was fairly expensive though i'm i was impressed i think that uh we we had somebody do it and and it was	2774	A
it seems to me like it's probably more expensive to put down linoleum almost than it is to put down carpet	2774	A
kind of depends on the on the quality of carpet i suppose but	2774	A
uh in- in the case of the linoleum they have to rip up everything and and fix the floor so it's	2774	A
uh i don't know whatever but they have to put stuff on the floor and it's uh kind of a process so	2774	A
well it sounds like you've had some pretty good experiences with uh with uh um home repair	2774	A
um-hum	2774	B
oh we just barely did that too	2774	B
yes	2774	B
oh yes we have brick on the outside and uh it the colors that were there changed the and the colors we painted changed the entire look of the house completely	2774	B
yes it was really exciting it was fun	2774	B
um-hum well the other thing that we did was the roof of our house and uh we did that a different color also of course uh	2774	B
being a woman most of these things were done by uh the men and uh so i wasn't directly involved but uh	2774	B
they really were helpful i know to our house	2774	B
that's right	2774	B
well as a matter of fact one thing uh i have a young son and one thing we did was we had paneling on the inside of our uh front of our house or the hallway of our house rather	2774	B
and we were repainting the the front room in the hall there and we took down that paneling and he helped me and and uh he was it- it was fun to work with him	2774	B
and uh and help putty up the holes together and and do things like that he was a	2774	B
oh i like it so much better it makes it so much lighter you know it really um	2774	B
you know and people who have been to my house before and and then now really have liked it much much better too so it's been fun	2774	B
yeah yeah exactly	2774	B
hm that's interesting	2774	B
yeah	2774	B
oh i bet it does-	2774	B
uh-huh we have it's been really fun	2774	B
well okay you too bye-bye	2774	B
oh God um that's hard i i suspect there's	2725	B
i i don't even know um	2725	B
virtually everything	2725	B
um	2725	B
yeah that- that- that- that i i got- i didn't know that much actually that that it it it's happening a lot	2725	B
and and and she's a woman	2725	B
oh really	2725	B
who is that	2725	B
right what- what- what- what's her name	2725	B
oh the only Texas politician that i actually know is is a woman is Ann Richards	2725	B
yeah who who to me is just um i i had heard very little about her before but	2725	B
um i saw her speak at the uh i guess it was the eighty	2725	B
yep the eighty six no the eighty	2725	B
eighty whatever and i was just i feel in love with her	2725	B
yeah that's true i think that there's but that i think that will come with time with um	2725	B
more more- more more PACs and so forth being interested in them	2725	B
oh really why is that	2725	B
that's interesting i um no i'm i'm	2725	B
i'm probably partial to uh i mean i i think that there there are certain jobs that men i mean i'm not certainly- i don't- i don't mean to be sexist here but i think there are certain jobs like minister i think probably	2725	B
probably women are better gynecologists than men-	2725	B
and i think you know men are possibly better	2725	B
yeah- maybe pediatricians although that i i could split on i i think i have some i know some good males	2725	B
but there are some things i just think you know that	2725	B
uh	2725	B
now that's interesting yes um	2725	B
hum	2725	B
right anybody who wants to go into combat i get to that point uh	2725	B
go ahead and have fun yeah and	2725	B
i'm i'm no yeah there are some that i there are some jobs like for instance i get a little bit annoyed when i see people saying	2725	B
um that they should you know there was an issue a while ago in New York where they were going to lower the standards for firemen	2725	B
because they so women could be firemen-	2725	B
right and i might think if you're going to lower the standards you know you're you're just	2725	B
what what what what good is a fireman who can't pick me up	2725	B
but as for other stuff i think i had no idea about the politics and i i i think that's wonderful i mean	2725	B
yeah we're very impatient	2725	B
well that's probably better i suspect	2725	B
as a general rule i i don't know why this is but i suspect it's probably the case that women are politicians- are are are more honest politicians	2725	B
i mean it it it may be because there's an old boy network	2725	B
that's true	2725	B
everywhere- everywhere- everywhere- any anywhere you go basically there there's there's	2725	B
well yeah i guess although there are some women who honestly if they were uh i i'd go running if they were chasing- chasing chasing me	2725	B
but but you are right i think there are some i i think that you know more often than not i'd be you know i mean there- there there are still biological differences that i think lots of people forget	2725	B
um i'm probably of of of the opinion- i i never had that situation so i'm probably of the opinion that uh that well if they really want to i guess maybe they should but i'd really- talk them_1 i'd sort of look at it and go well are you really sure you want to do this i mean	2725	B
i mean	2725	B
yeah	2725	B
right	2725	B
even today	2725	B
uh-huh	2725	B
i'm i'm i'm i'm sort of like that i believe in equal but different	2725	B
i mean there there are differences and people just have to sort of realize that there are differences and	2725	B
work from there and figure it out you know	2725	B
were- you mean every- they're they're everything a politician should be	2725	B
uh-huh	2725	B
until women are are better represented in politics i think is one of the backings but	2725	B
yeah almost	2725	B
almost came well not not not so close but uh	2725	B
oh really	2725	B
i don't- i don't know anything about her politics i just saw her and saw her give this wonderful speech	2725	B
is she	2725	B
oh	2725	B
well well well	2725	B
i guess it was good while it lasted for her	2725	B
you know i don't know what to say about that	2725	B
uh there there are some active- now that i think of it there are some um we don't have like the mayors and and and the governor	2725	B
the governor of New York Mario Cuomo you know	2725	B
if ever there was an old Italian you know part- part of the old boy network Mario Cuomo i suspect	2725	B
but	2725	B
yes he's still the governor um	2725	B
and still they're desperately trying to talk him into running for president	2725	B
oh yes they they keep his name always pops up an for for for the Democratic nomination because i think if he would actually take the nomination he's one of the only Democrats i know that could actually possibly do it at some point	2725	B
but um as for	2725	B
as for the rest of	2725	B
but um as for as for the rest of we have we have some senators and and and representatives and so forth but that's probably about all	2725	B
i don't i don't know that we have that many women politicians around here	2725	B
i guess New York is still still behind the times not like you Texans are way up there	2725	B
really	2725	B
that's really cause i don't even i couldn't think of a woman mayor that i'd ever known around-	2725	B
some sort of uh county mayor	2725	B
well yeah okay	2725	B
she does the actual running	2725	B
wow	2725	B
wow that that that is a lot for a mayor	2725	B
that's great	2725	B
well i guess i guess if	2725	B
if she deserves it i mean	2725	B
now that's strange	2725	B
i i didn't know that that seems like quite an improvement i mean or quite a quite a significant jump for uh	2725	B
okay what do you think are the most significant- significant changes women have taken a role in	2725	A
i i to me	2725	A
yeah well uh to me the biggest significant thing i've noticed is women are becoming mayors of big cities more and more seems like especially in the South	2725	A
oh yeah Dallas has one Houston has a fact- as a matter of fact the mayor of Houston is the highest paid mayor in the United States	2725	A
uh-huh	2725	A
yeah and	2725	A
uh the mayor of Houston	2725	A
oh gosh i can't remember what her name is	2725	A
okay our governor yes	2725	A
uh-huh	2725	A
democratic convention thing yeah	2725	A
well i uh my-	2725	A
most of the the larger cities like Dallas has a woman mayor San Antonio has a woman mayor Houston has a human mayor- uh woman mayor so that to me has been the biggest jump i think that i've noticed uh	2725	A
women are they're getting in politics a lot more than uh they were years ago or they're more a little be more accepted- i still think they're have a hard time getting in because they don't have the money to spend on campaigning like the men do for some reason	2725	A
yeah i do too	2725	A
an i i'm still i guess i'm kind of chauvinistic i still i still prefer men doctors and men lawyers but you know that's just me yeah	2725	A
i don't know i just have more confidence in them for some reason	2725	A
oh i do too	2725	A
right but yeah absolutely	2725	A
maybe pediatricians even	2725	A
yeah yeah	2725	A
but i get irritated when i hear a man telephone operator i don't like men telephone operators i expect women i grew up with women telephone operators and that's what i want to hear	2725	A
and i don't uh i don't like to see women truck drivers	2725	A
and i think you know if women want to go into combat go you know if they're that stupid they want to do it go ahead and go on i don't care	2725	A
yeah yeah in fact go head- right ahead sister if there- if you're going to get out there and want to go i'm you know i'm all for it i'm not going to stop you	2725	A
oh huh so women could be see i don't believe in that either	2725	A
that's right	2725	A
that's right absolutely i agree i agree an	2725	A
yeah i i think and i've read you know all the magazines have an article on it women's magazines course you probably wouldn't be reading but i do but- and it says that that women are- are uh they're not as quick to make a	2725	A
a decision you know they study the the cases more before they decide on something than men do men are a little more anxious- they'll they'll make a quicker decision than a women women will	2725	A
yeah women will study it a little bit more before they uh come right out and uh	2725	A
yeah it is	2725	A
yeah i think so too i really do i don't	2725	A
yeah and i don't think they're motivated by greed as much as men are	2725	A
they probably have a comfortable home with their husband- you know if they're that high they'll probably you know and so and i think men are motivated by a lot of them in politics to me by greed	2725	A
and uh like you said a good good old boy system is a is rampant in almost every state	2725	A
anywhere you go you've got it even in the police department every place else you know	2725	A
i i don't mind seeing women policeman too much if they're accompanied with a man policeman i don't like to see women out on their own you know	2725	A
i know they could	2725	A
i would too yeah i would too i i really-	2725	A
absolutely and i get to see i'm always have been irritated when	2725	A
uh girls want to play football i don't think girls should play football- i'm sorry it's too uh the women are built different they just don't need to be banged around like that and the parents that get out there and demand that their daughter play football because she wants to it just	2725	A
i just can't believe it i wouldn't do that to my daughter i don't think girls should play football i just don't	2725	A
well you know oh it's just not very feminine of course i i'm a feminine- i i'm not a feminist i	2725	A
i like being feminine i don't want to i don't want to be equal to the man and do the you know do everything they do and get everything i think i agree	2725	A
equal pay for equal work if the women does the same she ought to get paid the same i mean you- and that's that probably is my biggest complaint about woman's role is they don't they are not paid- absolutely they're not paid equal to what men are	2725	A
and for some- i don't know if they'll ever	2725	A
there's a a handful of women that are a handful but i don't know if in my lifetime if i'll ever see it equal	2725	A
but uh you know i you never know	2725	A
yes yeah	2725	A
i know and i think-	2725	A
but you know so many people don't want to	2725	A
think like that they just think you know equal and that's it they don't take any in to account differences or anything and i just there are differences whether we like it or not there are differences and they uh	2725	A
but i the women politicians that i've known uh not not personally but i've seen- you know seen and the politics i have really liked they're uh	2725	A
fair and uh knowledgeable and i i just i like women politicians for some reason	2725	A
and i guess have a hard time getting backing you know somebody probably doesn't you know the men won't	2725	A
yeah	2725	A
yeah and i don't think in my lifetime i'll see a woman president or even vice president	2725	A
oh came close	2725	A
but now i didn't even i didn't even vote for Ann Richards though even though she's a woman i didn't vote for her	2725	A
no i	2725	A
well we really didn't have a whole lot to chose from down here but in our governors race but i i'm a Republican and i just- i voted for the party and you know she was Democratic an and she's really having a rough time i all ready you know she's	2725	A
uh yeah they you know giving her she's trying to straighten up the insurance board which is you know a bigger task than anybody has a right to try and tackle and	2725	A
oh she'll probably not make it i'm sure but	2725	A
anyway	2725	A
yeah	2725	A
do you all have many women politicians up there	2725	A
uh-huh	2725	A
oh yes yes	2725	A
uh-huh uh-huh now he's still the governor Cuomo is	2725	A
oh okay	2725	A
oh are they really	2725	A
really	2725	A
um	2725	A
oh really	2725	A
oh	2725	A
oh	2725	A
well they do have a university- and most of our suburbs have- um they're fairly large suburbs they have uh mostly women mayors also	2725	A
uh-huh	2725	A
really	2725	A
well now see uh the- the the difference in Houston and Dallas Dallas is uh let me see Dallas is really run by the city manager and the mayor is just kind of a you know not a really but now Houston's its mayor	2725	A
uh mayor what's the other way they go the city council- i mean uh	2725	A
oh what is that guy i'm trying to think uh something manager like a city manager he really runs the town	2725	A
and but now in Houston she actually does the firing	2725	A
yeah she does the running down there and that's why she makes more money than the mayor of New York the mayor of Los Angeles	2725	A
uh uh she makes a hundred and thirty thousand dollars a year	2725	A
yeah yeah	2725	A
so she-	2725	A
yeah she also brought uh	2725	A
um chief of police as a woman down there also	2725	A
yeah it is	2725	A
yes yes and she just made that change	2725	A
we have recently the city of Plano has started a a situation it's pretty much volunteer as far as separating	2747	B
oh paper and bottles and you know cans and that sort of thing	2747	B
and uh it's not exactly curbside yet they've got these little igloo like things sitting up in various parts of town where you can take that stuff in if you want to	2747	B
the biggest thing that they've done is uh for forever we had been on the plastic trash bag business where everything was just uh put in uh plastic bags then set out in the alley	2747	B
but uh they came through with these big green uh plastic dumpster kind of things uh where you put everything except lawn trash	2747	B
and then they they	2747	B
we got these uh paper sacks to put uh lawn debris and stuff in supposedly uh you know it can all be mulched at once the paper sack and everything	2747	B
only problem is you can't get anything in the paper sack	2747	B
yeah they're too small on the top and they're they're smaller than most grass catchers and that sort of thing so	2747	B
they just started this uh oh maybe a month or two ago	2747	B
and uh	2747	B
they uh	2747	B
the local folks you know they're just starting to use them_1 now that the grass is starting to you know be cut and everything we're getting a lot of complaints about them_1 but	2747	B
uh	2747	B
you know i- i realize the whole the whole recycling trash thing is a is such a problem because the landfill and all that uh	2747	B
i don't know what are they	2747	B
they're probably doing more than that up there i'm i guess you all started this sort of thing long time before we did	2747	B
um-hum	2747	B
oh	2747	B
hum	2747	B
yeah	2747	B
um-hum	2747	B
yeah	2747	B
um um-hum	2747	B
yeah we uh we're coming to that here you know in the metroplex is getting big enough that um it'll happen i- i grew up in a	2747	B
uh kind of a a rural area of of west Texas and New Mexico where that just wasn't a problem matter of fact till recently we burned trash you know we had the big barrels out in in the alley	2747	B
and when it's filled up you just put a match to it and burned it well course that's that's almost unheard of anymore	2747	B
yeah yeah	2747	B
yeah we used to burn leaves and burn grass you know and all that	2747	B
as far as what to uh to do to encourage recycling i guess a lot of states	2747	B
i have noticed on uh on Coke bottles and and whatnot we went i've got some relatives in Iowa	2747	B
and uh there's a big thing up there what is it nickel for every bottle or some such thing and you know people	2747	B
people actively go out and and uh seek them you know i guess that's one way of doing it you know is to make it worthwhile	2747	B
um	2747	B
um-hum	2747	B
yeah	2747	B
well course there's uh	2747	B
people will go after aluminum cans and stuff down here because it's just uh there's not a per can value on them_1 but there is a	2747	B
just in the metal recycling itself i've	2747	B
i i'm not sure what it's what a can is worth now it's couple cents you know you've got to get quite a few of them_1 to really make it worthwhile but	2747	B
it turns out that uh on a a Sunday morning after a Dallas Saturday night there's enough aluminum cans and stuff along the road to make it worthwhile yeah	2747	B
um-hum	2747	B
um-hum	2747	B
um-hum	2747	B
um-hum	2747	B
yeah	2747	B
yeah	2747	B
our soil situation down here in this particular area we're in a real hard black gooey gummy awful black clay situation	2747	B
and uh	2747	B
oh yeah you could lose a small dog in the cracks sometimes	2747	B
uh so i	2747	B
um-hum	2747	B
um-hum	2747	B
yeah	2747	B
there was a thing in the local news here yesterday there's a little town down south of Fort Worth called Mansfield and there's some tire recycling outfit wants a permit down there they say out of every tire you can get a gallon- what amounts to a gallon of diesel fuel	2747	B
and like you say several pounds of this uh carbon black and uh material for for making roads and anymore there's a couple pounds of stainless steel	2747	B
in most of the uh the tires yeah because the steel belted tires and uh	2747	B
it's a totally gas fired operation they say there's no exhaust whatsoever you know most people think of tire yeah those burning tire uh	2747	B
see there was what was it Massachusetts i remember here a couple of years ago reading about one that had been on fire for long period of time you know it just smolders and the black smoke pours out of it	2747	B
yeah	2747	B
over in Fort Worth they had one catch fire here a couple of years ago and they had an awful time putting it out	2747	B
but our big problem down here course is uh tires laying around down on the ground and stuff uh collect water and then of course that becomes mosquito breeding area and uh	2747	B
that can be a real	2747	B
um yeah	2747	B
yeah	2747	B
um-hum	2747	B
yeah	2747	B
yeah what happens to us anyways as you can imagine in Texas you've got urban areas that are probably as compact or as you know densely populated as just about any place in the country but then	2747	B
then you run into uh areas you know they've	2747	B
we've got a statistic down here that they like to use you know you can take the population of the world and pack it in the state of Texas about the density of Houston and then you'd have the rest of the world to grow crops in because there wouldn't be any people in it	2747	B
and New Mexico too for that matter that are bigger than Rhode Island but uh	2747	B
we had a our our government rep i'm in DSEG here	2747	B
okay Jim um what are they doing down in your uh neck of the woods for recycling	2747	A
yeah	2747	A
oh that's they're they're too small	2747	A
yeah	2747	A
yeah that's true right	2747	A
um	2747	A
yeah well up Massachusetts i i live in Rhode Island	2747	A
and you know i travel back and forth which isn't too far it's only i only live about uh about eight miles from the plant	2747	A
so i live right up in the uh in the northeast corner of Rhode Island and and the plant is is in uh is in the like the south uh southwest section of Massachusetts it comes down like kind of a neck so	2747	A
i don't have for to travel but i live in a rural community and last year we started recycling they made it mandatory in in our town	2747	A
and they gave you uh uh little blue containers that you put all your your uh your bottles and cans	2747	A
and like the plastic milk jugs	2747	A
you put those in there and they recycle those and then you put your newspapers in a separate or either you put them_1 in a a paper bag or or you tie them_1 up with string	2747	A
you put those in a separate bundle and they have a special truck that comes around and they pick them_1 up curbside	2747	A
and then the rest of it is just you know goes to the landfill i guess or whatever they whatever they incinerate it maybe	2747	A
oh yeah	2747	A
yeah	2747	A
and that's right	2747	A
that's what we used to do too years ago we used to do the same thing	2747	A
yep	2747	A
yeah we do the same yeah	2747	A
yeah all the states around us Connecticut uh Massachusetts New Hampshire i think Vermont and Maine do it Rhode Island's the only state that doesn't put a nickel deposit on the bottles	2747	A
but every other state does so you don't you don't see any trash along the sides of the roads people that throw bottles away there's other people that come along with plastic bags and they pick them_1 up and and i guess they can make of a you know it's like working a part-time job	2747	A
uh it's all free just takes time and if you're retired and have nothing to do	2747	A
um	2747	A
oh just on the metal content	2747	A
yeah	2747	A
yeah	2747	A
to make it worth it yeah	2747	A
yeah	2747	A
uh my wife and i both graduated from the University of Rhode Island their uh master gardener program	2747	A
i guess every state has has uh uh a land grant college	2747	A
uh would used to be Brown University now it's uh University of Rhode Island	2747	A
and what we learned down there is that uh	2747	A
fifty percent when you when you mow your lawn fifty percent of all the nutrients are in that top section of the grass and most people kind of rake it up or they catch it in the grass catcher and they throw it away	2747	A
if you if you mow properly and just let it lay in there you refertilize your own soil besides building up a base	2747	A
so that's what we've been doing that for the last couple of years	2747	A
and you don't have to worry about uh fertilizing which causes a lot of thatch and all that kind of stuff so there's more and more people too are aware of that up here	2747	A
and they're not going out for chemicals they're not going out for a lot of fertilizers and stuff so they're letting it you know uh	2747	A
oh so	2747	A
summertimes it cracks when it heats when it gets	2747	A
oh yeah	2747	A
i was watching uh i was watching the news this morning uh national news and they were talking about uh i guess they got a a recycling dump for tires that caught on fire	2747	A
but they were saying that uh California they recycle their their	2747	A
all the tires and make like a a some kind of a rubberized compound and they incorporate that with uh with uh tar and they use it on their roads and they say the roads last a lot longer	2747	A
oh for the steel belted that's right i didn't think about	2747	A
yeah	2747	A
yeah yeah	2747	A
there could be the one up here some place i'm not really sure um	2747	A
yeah	2747	A
oh that's right too yeah i didn't think of yeah	2747	A
yeah Connecticut was uh is in the process of building a a plant to burn tires to generate electricity	2747	A
so i guess that's kind of of a a recycling process	2747	A
the uh all the all the communities in Rhode Island eventually are going to go on this like the recycling that we have now it depends on on each individual municipality	2747	A
uh we went on it quite early because of the town fathers said yeah you know we think it's a good idea	2747	A
but the state i think by nineteen ninety three every every town in the state has to go on this recycling program so it's like a forced	2747	A
um which is good i think	2747	A
yeah well you guys got	2747	A
yeah Houston's probably as big as this whole state of Rhode Island	2747	A
yeah	2747	A
right	2790	A
i guess the biggest one is number of women in the work force	2790	A
few are uh basically staying home and	2790	A
being homemakers and raising kids exclusively	2790	A
uh-huh	2790	A
yeah true well mine taught kindergarten but she was always uh	2790	A
i guess her schedule was shorter so she was always uh home	2790	A
yeah	2790	A
yeah that that statistic i guess has been growing every year it's it's something around sixty sixty five percent or so now	2790	A
uh i'm not sure what the future holds for that whether	2790	A
uh-huh	2790	A
that's unusual	2790	A
uh-huh	2790	A
yeah	2790	A
uh-huh	2790	A
yeah that is tough yeah we're looking at that now my wife's about six months along	2790	A
uh-huh	2790	A
true	2790	A
yeah	2790	A
i'm surprised that the main people you work for are women that do stay home	2790	A
i would think it would be women that were working full-time	2790	A
huh	2790	A
uh-huh	2790	A
huh	2790	A
well i guess that's good they got something to keep them active	2790	A
yeah we're going to try and have her stay home for as long as possible	2790	A
what do you think	2790	A
yeah we think it's uh that important and	2790	A
i i kind of hope that the trend goes back in that direction i'm a a counselor and a therapist and i work with adolescents and	2790	A
i see some of the problems the kids have when they don't have a real good family structure	2790	A
uh-huh	2790	A
um-hum	2790	A
true	2790	A
well the husbands' roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore in terms of being the father figure and	2790	A
and with women working so much they're kind of pulled out of it too so kids are raised around their friends and by the media	2790	A
that's contributed	2790	A
yeah maybe that's contributed to a lot of the problems that we see all the time so	2790	A
if there was some way for for women to to stay home even if they could work you know there are a lot of	2790	A
jobs that are coming about like in computers at home and those types of things that would	2790	A
at least in some ways	2790	A
bridge the gap	2790	A
about	2790	A
they'll understand them	2790	A
the divorce rate keeps hovering around fifty percent or so and it got higher than that for a while um	2790	A
it's hard to say	2790	A
families are such a strange configuration anymore	2790	A
um i i see a lot of families where you know in the in the	2790	A
back i grew up about the same time you did	2790	A
back in those times we	2790	A
pretty much were taught how to be responsible	2790	A
nowadays it's not the case kids don't kids are bombarded with all kinds of junk and	2790	A
one of the reasons i guess is because there's so much more income in the family with both parents working	2790	A
they get bombarded with junk and they don't have to do anything around the house they never learned to be responsible when the bigger trend called the boomerang kids where they move out for a while and they come back and you got twenty and thirty year olds who are living at home with mom and dad	2790	A
so know you create a bigger bigger family generation after generation but not really on purpose	2790	A
so	2790	A
it's not not a real functional situation anyway	2790	A
i don't know it's i don't know that that trend's going to change the single parent type families and the blended families	2790	A
as long as we've got so many other crazy things going on in society	2790	A
uh-huh	2790	A
yeah it is i guess unless unless there's a a major swing in the change of what's important to people	2790	A
you know probably keep going downhill	2790	A
and i i don't know we we feel like that that we can make it on one income it it may be tough but we may have to give up some	2790	A
some things	2790	A
yeah	2790	A
yeah i think so too	2790	A
okay	2790	A
well i've enjoyed it Stephanie	2790	A
uh-huh	2790	A
bye-bye	2790	A
what what changes do you think have taken place in the last generation	2790	B
yeah	2790	B
uh-huh yeah i i i grew up in uh sixties and early seventies and uh my mom didn't work at all when i was growing up she didn't start working until i was	2790	B
um well into high school	2790	B
so i i had the advantage of having a mom at home that nowadays kids	2790	B
it's a luxury item for	2790	B
mothers to be home with their kids	2790	B
always home by the time you got home	2790	B
uh-huh	2790	B
it seems like there's it seems like there's a grass roots um	2790	B
effort or whatever going on i i um clean houses part-time and almost all the people that i clean for believe it or not are mothers that don't work	2790	B
um	2790	B
they're all um it's and it's i think it's kind of a new movement it's going back towards	2790	B
you know women have come into the work force in the last twenty thirty years and now they're wanting to go back to the old days where you know	2790	B
women stayed home with the kids you know and try to give the kids quality time	2790	B
and i i think that in the future you're i think you're going to see a lot more	2790	B
um women choosing to not work after they have a baby	2790	B
um i think with uh	2790	B
the uh	2790	B
the work force with the the salaries that a lot of a lot of the women that i work for have husbands who are um vice presidents of companies and i think with uh um	2790	B
it seems like it's more the upper-class people	2790	B
um i don't see it as much the like in my situation where i don't i don't have children yet but ideally i would like to be able to stay home with my kids but realistically that's i'm i'm	2790	B
realizing that's probably not going to be possible	2790	B
um for middle-class people to be able to live just on one income	2790	B
uh-huh i think it's going to be a luxury item to be able to stay home with your kids	2790	B
you know it's going to kind of kind of go along with the BMW in the driveway and or in the garage or whatever um and the quarter of a million dollar home or whatever	2790	B
yeah believe it or not though the all the women that stay home are real busy when they are home um they're real active in volunteer work	2790	B
um	2790	B
one of the women is real active with uh muscular dystrophy	2790	B
and uh does a lot of of work with them	2790	B
on a volunteer basis but it's still it's almost like a job but she just doesn't get paid for it	2790	B
yeah	2790	B
when when your wife has her baby is she going to stay home or is she going to go back to work	2790	B
that that that i would i would like to be able to do that	2790	B
um-hum	2790	B
yeah i i see a difference in the generation of	2790	B
even the generation before me	2790	B
uh were you know mom was like um Mrs Cleaver uh you know June Cleaver or whatever where the the attitudes were a lot different um	2790	B
as far as i think the kids back then seemed to be a lot more	2790	B
um	2790	B
there wasn't a lot of the drugs and alcohol and	2790	B
um a lot of the the things that are going on in today's society i think morally	2790	B
um it seems like there was	2790	B
the people- people were a lot better back then as far as having higher standards	2790	B
huh	2790	B
yeah	2790	B
yeah that's true	2790	B
and i think i think you're going to see a lot more of that in the future	2790	B
um-hum	2790	B
yeah i think that um	2790	B
in the future um the the family unit as it as it once was known is is going to be nonexistent	2790	B
where do how do what do you think	2790	B
uh as far as do do you think there's going to be still a family unit or or do you think that um the trend is going more towards single parenting	2790	B
um-hum	2790	B
uh-huh	2790	B
yeah	2790	B
yeah	2790	B
yeah	2790	B
yeah i i think that eventually the the family unit's just not going to even exist anymore	2790	B
it's it is that like you said the divorce rate is getting so high	2790	B
that i think there's going to be more single parent families than there are	2790	B
um	2790	B
you know two parent families	2790	B
that's pretty sad	2790	B
i i think in the long run though your child will benefit from that it'll make the	2790	B
the strain worthwhile	2790	B
well i need to go ahead and and wrap it up it was really nice talking to you	2790	B
and uh thanks a lot okay bye bye	2790	B

network and i understand that the producers got themselves in a little trouble they'll probably have to pay a	2787	B
compensation of some sort for that	2787	B
but we got to see it anyway so	2787	B
they showed a little initiative	2787	B
right	2787	B
where did you uh come to Texas from	2787	B
from Indiana	2787	B
the uh	2787	B
Sherman is far enough away from Dallas to be uh away from most of the the blithe that associate is associated with Dallas	2787	B
they uh i work with Texas Instruments also	2787	B
actually i've been with	2787	B
TI for thirty four years	2787	B
in research	2787	B
my wife originally came from Des Moines so she's from that turf up there	2787	B
right	2787	B
yeah i was in the	2787	B
uh Kokomo uh last year uh late on in the year uh out to the Delco plant Delco Electronics out that way	2787	B
they uh well we had we do a lot of uh	2787	B
work with automotives that's lots of T i parts on the	2787	B
on automotive uh things that don't have the TI bug on them	2787	B
we make uh	2787	B
anything- anything that's uh metal clad for example aluminum bumpers that are metal clad and all sorts we have we make we make that in Massachusetts	2787	B
the uh	2787	B
a lot of the sensors that go there	2787	B
when uh automatic chokes were common in automobiles well	2787	B
we had a hundred percent capture of the American market we made all the automatic chokes for Ford Chrysler Chevrolet	2787	B
all that so there's a lot of things like that that Texas Instruments makes	2787	B
that even the employees don't know they make for the most part	2787	B
yeah hm	2787	B
yeah we have a lot of electronic stuff there as well but what i described was mainly uh associated with metals and sensors which is mainly what our Attleboro Massachusetts group does	2787	B
oh i liked it fine	2787	B
uh only two days we we were out visiting uh Delco to show them some of the uh computerized map things that we had that sort of thing	2787	B
yeah well we we haven't	2787	B
been contaminated yet shall i say with the blithe	2787	B
but there's some older areas in Dallas and Oak Cliff that are pretty	2787	B
you wouldn't want to be out at night let's put it that way in that area	2787	B
no no thank goodness	2787	B
but uh	2787	B
and it's all the way across town it's on more on the south side than it is the north side anyway	2787	B
uh	2787	B
but i guess all the older cities have that	2787	B
have that problem you say you play cards do you play bridge	2787	B
i'm familiar with it	2787	B
yeah right	2787	B
yeah my uh i was in the uh service right after college the Korean war going on	2787	B
and my wife and i played uh	2787	B
all sorts of card games that we got out of uh book of Hoyle of which euchre was one that we learned	2787	B
pinochle	2787	B
uh	2787	B
flabbergash ever hear that i bet that's one you haven't heard of	2787	B
yeah- yeah yeah yeah	2787	B
yeah	2787	B
well in Texas of course the Texan game is with dominos playing forty two	2787	B
right	2787	B
it's it's a bidding game also but not like bridge you only go around one time with dominos	2787	B
and uh you probably haven't even heard of it but uh i'm i'm telling you that's a Texas game	2787	B
that's a very uh very well known old timers	2787	B
Texas game lots of people uh play that	2787	B
yeah in fact that used to be called Baptist bridge because the Baptist don't believe in playing cards so you could but it's okay to play dominos so you	2787	B
forty two is called Baptist bridge	2787	B
oh no i i like cribbage also that's a good game for two	2787	B
and uh	2787	B
uh i haven't	2787	B
really gotten serious about it like the resurgence i played it in uh teams but	2787	B
not until- until it came back so to speak i haven't played that with the	2787	B
the doubling bet and so forth	2787	B
well i uh had no one around me when i was growing up i- i uh solved chess problems and have several chess	2787	B
problem books you know mate and foremoves and that sort of thing which i enjoy but uh	2787	B
i didn't have a uh anyone else around me uh when i was growing up that was all that interested in chess i know all the moves and i can follow the game and that sort of thing and enjoy watching	2787	B
experts play	2787	B
i participated one time with a uh	2787	B
grand master	2787	B
we used to have a chess club at Texas Instruments and uh	2787	B
we actually had a grand master in the area who came out and	2787	B
played all of us simultaneously you know	2787	B
and he also played us uh blindfold chess one one one on uh one and uh as the game was going along uh he says uh	2787	B
mate in six and if you play chess you know six is a long way ahead and uh we all looked at the board and couldn't figure out how he could possibly mate six and sure enough he mated in six just like he said he would	2787	B
yeah	2787	B
but he played us uh on a round robin where he walks around the tables and plays everybody	2787	B
oh it's been several years ago like uh probably ten years	2787	B
no it's too long ago uh i really don't but he was he was something else we had one member who's really uh in the professional class if you will he used to go to the matches all the time	2787	B
and his	2787	B
let's see i've forgotten let's see the grand master and then right out of that's master what's the one that's just under master	2787	B
expert yeah he was expert	2787	B
so uh he gave him a run for his money when he he had to be playing all of us but	2787	B
if he passed you uh twice uh you were out in other words if you hadn't moved when he went around so the more members he beat well the faster he got around and uh so Tony the	2787	B
right actually my son once said that that perhaps um what we should do is is buy a little square of land some place in the Midwest and and that might be the solution	2709	A
uh-huh	2709	A
um-hum	2709	A
um-hum um-hum	2709	A
um-hum no i don't i don't know i lived in the Middle East for sometime and i- i do believe there must have been some sort of quota system because uh i know a lot of people that	2709	A
were in a sense not qualified is the wrong word but certainly were deserving to come and it seemed to take them a long time or or there was a lot of uncertainty as to whether they would be able to come	2709	A
and so i would guess that you know there are quotas for different places	2709	A
uh you know i- i- i think there's something about being able to to claim um	2709	A
imminent danger or i'm not sure what the terminology is maybe political	2709	A
asylum- yeah there there you go you got the term and maybe that's an an issue with a a lot of people i don't know	2709	A
but yeah i- i guess i haven't been in a situation where it's it's been threatening to to me uh	2709	A
um-hum	2709	A
um-hum	2709	A
um-hum um-hum	2709	A
i was going to say i'm not sure- i- i would guess that it's not that they are any brighter but they just maybe work harder or	2709	A
right right maybe- but maybe part of that's the problem that here we've we've let this value slip	2709	A
and they need to have some competition	2709	A
um-hum	2709	A
well that's too bad	2709	A
um-hum	2709	A
um-hum	2709	A
um-hum um-hum	2709	A
oh that's really sad	2709	A
um-hum	2709	A
um-hum	2709	A
um-hum	2709	A
um-hum	2709	A
well and it sounds like you feel that there is need for change maybe the	2709	A
uh you know the	2709	A
there is too big of a concentration coming all at once to to allow for adequate melting into the society	2709	A
right right exactly	2709	A
oh	2709	A
um-hum	2709	A
hum	2709	A
right	2709	A
right right right	2709	A
um-hum um-hum	2709	A
right	2709	A
i would i would suspect that they have	2709	A
well i guess um	2709	A
i don't have much much more to contribute to the topic	2709	A
yeah	2709	A
um-hum	2709	A
um-hum	2709	A
right	2709	A
um-hum	2709	A
goal directed	2709	A
goal directed	2709	A
oh i see	2709	A
um-hum	2709	A
sure sure	2709	A
um-hum	2709	A
um-hum um-hum	2709	A
yes	2709	A
up in the Gaithersburg area	2709	A
um-hum	2709	A
well no i think i think there as i recall in my son's class there were were an awful an awful lot of minorities- minorities yeah and uh of all of all varieties and	2709	A
with the same uh you know some of the some of the same problems that you've mentioned but um i don't know i guess i wasn't involved enough to to um	2709	A
really stop to think about it	2709	A
um-hum um-hum	2709	A
um-hum	2709	A
exactly exactly	2709	A
right right	2709	A
well it was good talking to you	2709	A
and i hope-	2709	A
okay and have a good weekend all righty bye-bye	2709	A
well i'll tell you why i feel so i feel strongly about this topic i don't know a whole lot about the immigration laws but i do know that in the where i live and i teach school	2709	B
there are so many Orientals that have come here and there's a lot of Mexican people too which is not neither here nor there but the fact is that all the Orientals that are here are very affluent	2709	B
uh very wise in money matters and have taken- have taken over a lot of businesses and have really	2709	B
kind- it's kind of scary because they're so bright they're all the kids that i have that are Oriental are really far above	2709	B
the American kids and they and the the parents are unbelievable because they are just on the way up and money is their main goal	2709	B
and it's kind- it really is kind of scary because there's there's just oodles of them_1 and you can not believe the businesses and corporations that have been taken over by Orientals	2709	B
and it's kind- it's kind of scares me not that i don't want them here and not that i don't appreciate the fact that you know that they have rights too but on the other hand you feel like almost they're they're invading us to the point where they're going to take over	2709	B
i think probably that's a good idea because i lived in Iowa for about- for about ten years before i came here and i was born in Ohio	2709	B
so it it really and there is there are a lot of Mexican people here because we're so close to the border and and they are wonderful people and and i'm not you know i don't want to deny them their rights just that you you feel like when you	2709	B
were born and raised here and you worked real- very hard to make this country what it is	2709	B
uh it scares you when you feel like somebody's taking over and a lot of these people plan one day to go back you know to to Vietnam or to you know Taiwan or wherever they're from	2709	B
and take with them a lot of American dollars plus a lot of power in American companies- companies- companies and it's kind of scary and you know i don't know i don't know the immigration laws that uh that well and i do not and in fact i don't know them at all i don't know how many	2709	B
people they allow in the United States per year or if there's even a i don't even know if there is a number that they allow in anymore do you know anything about that	2709	B
um-hum	2709	B
yeah	2709	B
i would think so too it	2709	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2709	B
asylum of some sort	2709	B
um-hum	2709	B
well	2709	B
well i teach in the suburb of Dallas and and uh my kids go to school in another suburb of Dallas	2709	B
and uh with very very good school systems and they're considered you know one of the top three in the state both of them you know and it seems like a lot of the Orientals make sure that their kids go to these schools	2709	B
and they're head and shoulders above a lot of the kids here and the kids in this area are very bright and come from you know parents that are professionals or semiprofessionals and and uh very interested in their education but	2709	B
uh i think in the last year i'm not if i'm not mistaken in four of the six high schools	2709	B
the graduating class valedictorian and salutatorian were uh almost- half or more Oriental	2709	B
and you know they're just extremely bright kids and also they value learning	2709	B
well i- i think things come easy for them_1 too but i do think that they have that work ethic that we somehow have missed the boat in with a lot of kids in the United States i don't	2709	B
they uh don't want to work for anything they want it to come to them but and be there but they don't want to work hard and these kids work really hard and and they have	2709	B
yeah i know i agree with that i agree with that	2709	B
but what i see is you the competition is there but instead of meeting the challenge they're starting to resent them and it's causing you know i think some some problems	2709	B
it really is it because we see a lot of racial problems in Dallas- the Dallas area anyway especially in Dallas and it's mainly Black and and and Hispanic	2709	B
but uh there is some there has been some resentment with Orientals in the Black community because they've started businesses there and the Blacks resent them coming in and taking their money and there's been some violence because of it	2709	B
it is it's it is very sad so you know i really i i've i've always prided myself on not being prejudice and being	2709	B
you know um welcoming- welcoming everyone that wants to come here and even when i was younger when- when i was in college i was a member of the NAACP because_1 i lived up north and i was very into that the human rights part of everything	2709	B
but i i've i've become very cynical in the last three four years living in Texas	2709	B
um-hum um-hum	2709	B
well and exactly that's exactly true plus the fact that these people do come for a short period of time two two three four maybe five years and then go back	2709	B
and pick our brains which is wonderful and take all that back with them and and uh plus a lot of American dollars but in in the long run maybe that's going to make a better world too you know you just don't know	2709	B
and- and yet you know with uh with uh	2709	B
there's somebody on my other line but i'm going to ignore that um	2709	B
anyway i just you you kind of you don't- you really don't know what to do and and	2709	B
i don't i want my kids to have values where they're accepting and so forth and both of my children	2709	B
are really tolerant- more tolerant of Blacks and Hispanics- Hispanics than they are of the Orientals for some reason they feel you know like they've taken over they feel like uh you know they're taking some of the	2709	B
the rewards that they should have and and i really don't want that to happen but but it's happening	2709	B
and i think a lot of their friends feel the same way too so	2709	B
and i really do wish i knew about quotas and really wish i <b_aside> hi <e_aside> i really do wish i i knew more about immigration laws because i have no idea any more because they've changed a great deal	2709	B
yeah i don't- i don't really either i wish i knew more and probably if i did i might be a little bit more uh tolerant	2709	B
perhaps and i and even if i- i really wish i knew the situations they were going back to or coming from you don't know any of that and you feel you know you can't put yourself in their shoes or really understand them unless	2709	B
and for some reason Orientals are very	2709	B
uh my good friend calls them pushy but i call them very that they know what they want and they go get it and in stores and so forth	2709	B
well pardon me yeah but in stores and things sometimes they can be very impolite because they can they get in front of you or they	2709	B
um they take something that you had in mind to get before you did you know just going for it they take it quickly and uh they don't think anything of that and i don't you know that's makes people resentful too and	2709	B
and yet they have they have a right to be here and i know that but it's it sometimes it's gets touchy	2709	B
so and i'm sure it's a lot different you're from Maryland you said what part of Maryland are you from	2709	B
oh okay my sister used to live there in that area and i i'm sure that it's a lot different there uh it's a lot different in Iowa- than in Iowa than it is here	2709	B
is that right	2709	B
um-hum well i you know since i teach i see that see it and and i feel and i love the example that most of these children and- give the	2709	B
our American children and yet you know i can see why some of the parents are fearful- that are fearful too and and it's a kind of a touchy situation	2709	B
and i wish that we could all just learn from each other and not feel threatened but it doesn't happen that way all the time	2709	B
so anyway it was good to talk to to you too and have a good trip in California all right well thank you bye-bye	2709	B
well uh i think she's mostly German Shepherd uh she was uh uh	2729	A
a person lives across the street from me	2729	A
uh brought her home from work because a coworker of hers uh had this dog appear on its front doorstep somebody somebody abandoned her and she's only about oh six- between six and eight six to eight weeks old	2729	A
and uh uh i can't understand why anyone would abandon this dog though she's almost- i mean she's that this young and she's almost housebroken	2729	A
i mean she actually asks to go out	2729	A
and uh yeah i was	2729	A
amazed	2729	A
really good temperament and very playful and affectionate good personality i don't know i can't imagine what uh	2729	A
would have been wrong with this dog so	2729	A
uh-huh	2729	A
oh really	2729	A
uh-huh	2729	A
oh yeah	2729	A
i had a uh last year i had another- i had another German Shepherd now this one was purebred and uh	2729	A
he when he was about seven months old got a gastrointestinal virus and	2729	A
was just about on death's door but uh managed to get him to a veterinarian in time and uh and on huge doses of antibiotics and	2729	A
he actually got over it with huh seven hundred dollars in vet bills	2729	A
um but he had actually was able to get him over that and then	2729	A
he was gaining weight again was just getting healthy and uh he put on about fifteen to twenty pounds after the thing and then he got hit by a Cadillac	2729	A
so i couldn't believe it that was that was really hard but	2729	A
and	2729	A
that was even harder though for i was on a business trip at the time and the dog was being house sit or dog sit whatever by some friends of mine down the street so they just felt absolutely awful	2729	A
and i felt felt probably worse for them than than for me because oh gosh they the uh	2729	A
this fellow's wife who was uh watching the dog probably- she i think she loved that dog more than i did and uh	2729	A
she was just- really attached to it but uh it's it's unfortunate but now i've got another one so	2729	A
um see he it it was just over a year uh it was in March of last year	2729	A
so um yeah it'd been didn't didn't have one for a whole year	2729	A
yeah	2729	A
right	2729	A
my dad's like that he uh he had a beagle that he loved and uh when that Beagle passed away uh he didn't want he wasn't going to have another dog there's no way no how and then uh the	2729	A
he the Beagle died in i guess about October and by Christmas time we went down to the pound and got him uh or i Humane Society and got uh got another one a stray and	2729	A
she she turned out to be a great dog and we had her for six years until she just passed away recently and again dad went through the whole thing but	2729	A
mom went and-	2729	A
yeah	2729	A
yeah it is	2729	A
well hopefully this one here Cocoa will live a full life	2729	A
uh-huh	2729	A
yeah	2729	A
right	2729	A
oh	2729	A
um-hum	2729	A
yeah	2729	A
huh	2729	A
that's not too bad the Golden Retriever's are good dogs too they're kind of like get that	2729	A
permanent smile to them	2729	A
they're always always happy i don't think i've ever seen them_1	2729	A
not look happy	2729	A
yeah	2729	A
right	2729	A
this-	2729	A
this friend of mine has the- well it's the same guy that was watching uh my German Shepherd when he got hit but uh went fishing with him on Friday	2729	A
and took he's got a full a pure bred Golden Retriever	2729	A
and then i had uh the puppy a little tiny puppy and we went and took the two dogs up fishing and this they just they had a ball romping around and you know you can't get a Golden Retriever near water without it jumping in	2729	A
and uh this Golden Retriever jumped in the the really fast moving uh river current and uh	2729	A
well no actually he had no trouble at all he first jumped in and i he's he's just about a year old himself and never had really i don't think he'd swum before	2729	A
but he jumped in in the the river	2729	A
well the puppy jumped in the into some of the pools but not into the i was careful to keep her away from the	2729	A
the fast moving water because_1 if she fell in then i'd of been had to go in after her	2729	A
and up here the waters probably about forty degrees right now	2729	A
and i would not have been fun trying to retrieve her but uh	2729	A
this dog Dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do i do now as he's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and uh	2729	A
actually paddled up against the current and uh made it back to the shore and climbed up and then he	2729	A
he jumped in again and he was swimming for quite a bit all afternoon he loved it	2729	A
Cocoa didn't think too much of it though she jumped in and then started screaming and uh made me pull her back out	2729	A
i pulled her out and uh then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad and	2729	A
so but she got over it	2729	A
so	2729	A
uh-huh	2729	A
uh-huh	2729	A
yeah	2729	A
yeah i've i live right across the street from a a big lake here um	2729	A
it's on Oneida lake and i'm wondering if uh	2729	A
if she'll want to go out there and go swimming next year i mean i've got the yards all fenced in so she doesn't run loose but uh	2729	A
she could go in sometime when if i'm watching her something-	2729	A
but	2729	A
oh really	2729	A
yeah	2729	A
no no	2729	A
oh really	2729	A
oh okay	2729	A
my my dog last German Shepherd it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too and that was the thing i couldn't figure out because he would go in the lake it wasn't like he didn't ah	2729	A
normally i mean he didn't seem to have a problem with getting wet but if you wanted to get him wet forget it	2729	A
yeah	2729	A
right right	2729	A
obstinate obstinate	2729	A
uh-huh	2729	A
huh	2729	A
i'll have to check it out i saw the the uh	2729	A
previews for it and all and it did look like it'd be a good movie- movie but uh	2729	A
really haven't had a whole lot of time to get out to see the movies lately but	2729	A
i got to do more	2729	A
more fun things like	2729	A

but it's nice having a dog here uh the	2729	A
oh no- oh no what's the unrequired- what's the word i'm looking for uh lots of affection	2729	A
no conditional- unconditional affection from the from the dog	2729	A
yeah	2729	A
yeah	2729	A
no no	2729	A
yeah well it's been nice talking to you we seem to be degenerating here so	2729	A

yeah	2729	B
well the German Shepherd that i had before we we had a little pool	2729	B
and uh she was she did not want any part of swimming but she liked to to get in the pool on the first step she'd just get on the first step and lay down	2729	B
you know in the summertime when it's really really hot	2729	B
and she'd just lay there on that step and just you know cool off	2729	B
um-hum	2729	B
yeah	2729	B
yeah	2729	B
well the one that we had just didn't want any part of that	2729	B
yeah and she oh baths oh gee she hated baths worse than anything it was it was just really a fight to you know get her clean	2729	B
have you seen uh Canine	2729	B
the movie oh you've got to see it especially since you have a German it is so cute	2729	B
yeah and uh an part of the the movie is where he's trying to clean this dog up and it's it's just hysterical	2729	B
um-hum	2729	B
yeah well that's how Cleo was- you know she'd lay on her step	2729	B
but that was that was the only time she wanted to get wet and she didn't want you getting her wet	2729	B
yeah	2729	B
but you really need to see that movie i i we- we bought the movie and i don't- i don't know how many times i've seen it and it came on TV the other night and i was watching it again and my husband heard me laughing and he said i can't believe that you're still getting such a kick out of that movie	2729	B
it is great	2729	B
yeah	2729	B
well we always wait until we can rent them you know	2729	B
oh really	2729	B
oh	2729	B
uh-huh	2729	B
oh yeah	2729	B
there's just	2729	B
right	2729	B
that's it	2729	B
really	2729	B
not critical at all yeah they're really wonderful	2729	B
great um currently i'm not doing a whole lot of exercise in any type of program	2776	A
i'm mainly do a lot of walking um i have a son that's a little bit overweight and um the best thing we found to do with him is to walk around so my wife and i kind of take turns	2776	A
um at one time i had a a fairly regular exercise program	2776	A
but in the last couple of months i've changed to a a new residence	2776	A
well i had a a a little routine that i i did for uh warm ups and then i did some uh very	2776	A
mild- mild say light weight lifting	2776	A
nothing and i'm not trying to make big bulging muscles just trying to try stay as firm as i can stay in my old age	2776	A
um-hum	2776	A
um-hum	2776	A
yeah that's that's that's a plus uh i have a total of five children i have three left living at home	2776	A
and they do take up a big part of my uh my evening and weekend	2776	A
and it's tough being a parent and trying to do all the things that you should do for yourself too	2776	A
it's uh something they don't tell you about when you're growing up	2776	A
yes when you become a parent most of your life is going to be dedicated to your children	2776	A
um-hum	2776	A
yeah	2776	A
well there's you you have to	2776	A
uh what i found from my experiences you have to budget time for yourself	2776	A
and then uh the you you can use what ever rationale you want but basically the healthier you stay the longer you'll live	2776	A
and uh you know if i spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer well then i'll be around a lot longer	2776	A
those people that i'm taking the ten minutes or twenty minutes away from now well you know get the enjoyment of me years past where i would have been if i hadn't taken it	2776	A
so if you kind of think of it as a rationale like that it works out fine	2776	A
um	2776	A
yeah	2776	A
oh i've done a lot of study over the years and i found that uh	2776	A
probably one of the worst things that uh anybody can ingest is chlorinated water	2776	A
yeah um the research i've done and uh i've actually been in the drinking watering business since eighty three and	2776	A
it's it's amazing that uh you know like prior to like nineteen twenty there were not- very few heart attacks	2776	A
there were none prior to nineteen hundred well in nineteen oh three they started experimenting with chlorinating the water in nineteen thirteen most of the major cities had chlorinated water and then after that we started having the hearts attacks	2776	A
and uh Dr Price wrote a book Coronarys Cholesterol and Chlorine you can usually find it at a health food store	2776	A
i know they had it in health food stores in Plano i used to live in Plano	2776	A
that's	2776	A
uh Dr Price yeah and it's amazing he makes the in you know it's a very small book and the guy's very opinionated	2776	A
um but he makes a very good case against chlorine there were no heart attacks before we started using it and he says- points out that people in uh England and uh or eating diets	2776	A
that quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that we're ingesting now	2776	A
and they weren't dropping dead of heart attacks and	2776	A
yeah he did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar to ours	2776	A
and uh proved that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis which is the clogging of the arteries and uh	2776	A
you know he's uh there's been a lot of reports since then and this whole thing about you know first it was stress then they went to cholesterol and now they're saying what's cholesterol well there's good cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol and	2776	A
you know it's it's it's amazing what he points out in that book and that um in fact he even uh there was a uh toxicologist for the Environmental Protection Agency	2776	A
who did work back in nineteen eighty six who wrote a letter to Dr Price in nineteen eighty seven	2776	A
and in this letter he praised Dr Price for the work he did back in the sixties on this	2776	A
and said that the EPA had been doing experiments on non human primates and proving that {ingestation} of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis	2776	A
and EPA never published that report	2776	A
uh Coronaries Cholesterol and Chlorine	2776	A
yeah	2776	A
yeah	2776	A
uh-huh	2776	A
yeah there's there's a there's a lot of good information out there	2776	A
uh about health and a lot of the uh a lot of the myths they've been passing around people are	2776	A
are starting to realize aren't true i mean i'm all for having a diet high in fiber and all that because_1 that's that's good for you	2776	A
uh but to to believe some of the things that they you know and i don't think anybody should be going out there and eating a high high fat diet	2776	A
but to think that that solely alone is going to cause something like arteriosclerosis is	2776	A
it's just hard to believe	2776	A
um-hum	2776	A
yeah i actually	2776	A
eat pretty much anything that i want	2776	A
and i've had my cholesterol checked and uh you know a few times and i've never been above uh like a hundred and fifty	2776	A
never	2776	A
and uh	2776	A
uh i mean i	2776	A
um	2776	A
you- you-	2776	A
well what they tell me but i mean you know	2776	A
they leave themselves wide open so they can't be sued	2776	A
but uh we've uh i work at the TI site in Hunt Valley Maryland	2776	A
yeah and we've had a few of the health fairs up here and	2776	A
you know i've always come out aces	2776	A
and i'm you know i'm not really that big on on watching what i eat	2776	A
i i do eat you know some health cookies that are high in fiber and	2776	A
low in fat and all that kind of stuff but i mean as far as being really concerned about	2776	A
ingesting too much uh chlorine i'm not or cholesterol i'm not worried about	2776	A
okay	2776	B
uh-huh	2776	B
yeah	2776	B
um what did you do when you exercised- when you did exercise regularly	2776	B
uh-huh	2776	B
uh-huh	2776	B
yeah	2776	B
um	2776	B
well right now um	2776	B
i try to when it's nice out it's been raining a lot this spring but i try to i have a bicycle and i like to cycle a lot	2776	B
and uh my husband and i we have entered a few rallies that's pretty popular in Texas i don't know if it's up north but	2776	B
like every weekend a small town will sponsor a rally and uh thousands of people come with their bikes and ride over hilly terrain for thirty or forty miles	2776	B
which that's a lot of fun um so we try to ride- ride during the week to stay in shape for that	2776	B
and um TI where i work has uh a fitness center so	2776	B
a lot of times after work or maybe on the weekend we'd go over there and lift weights and do the treadmill and um	2776	B
they have stair masters and all kinds of new machines that are fun to ride and	2776	B
and workout on so	2776	B
i try to i'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis	2776	B
i used to get into it and then get out of it based on my schedule so i'm trying to stay in in shape on a regular basis now	2776	B
but it's a big commitment we don't have any kids yet so that's a lot of the part of it	2776	B
uh-huh	2776	B
yeah	2776	B
yeah	2776	B
uh-huh	2776	B
that's why uh they- they uh really stress	2776	B
um at TI they really stress staying in shape but like in- staying fit overall fitness you know no smoking and all that but	2776	B
it's it's hard to find uh a actual exercise regimen that works for you you know	2776	B
because_1 like i know a lot of people that cycle they take their kids behind them_1 on the bikes and i don't know if that would work for me because	2776	B
i don't know i wouldn't want to pull a kid over hilly terrain but you know it's really hard to find something that works	2776	B
and it- you know to find time	2776	B
to do it and stay committed to it like three days a week or whatever	2776	B
i think maybe walking or running would probably work because_1 you it doesn't take much time and much money or whatever	2776	B
yeah	2776	B
uh-huh	2776	B
right	2776	B
uh-huh	2776	B
yeah um i've been learning a lot lately about	2776	B
um i've been reading a book by Kenneth Cooper i don't know if you're familiar- are familiar with him	2776	B
he was the pioneer of aerobics and all of health really he's kind of redid-	2776	B
um uh just pretty much	2776	B
the innovator of the whole exercise thing um and he was talking about the three things you could that cause	2776	B
aging are smoking inactivity and what was the other one	2776	B
i think it was yeah obesity so if you can control those three areas then you are going to live longer you know	2776	B
because_1 those are risk factors so	2776	B
anyway it's kind of a tip	2776	B
really	2776	B
um-hum	2776	B
um-hum	2776	B
man	2776	B
um-hum	2776	B
Dr Price	2776	B
um-hum	2776	B
that's really interesting	2776	B
uh-huh	2776	B
yeah	2776	B
um-hum	2776	B
hm	2776	B
and what's the name of this book again	2776	B
i'll have to remember that that'd be really interesting my husband wants to go into med school and be a neurosurgeon so he's really interested in the heart	2776	B
and he's in fact he's a well heart too i mean he's uh	2776	B
he's done a lot of research on	2776	B
like how your heart	2776	B
sorry he just- made me laugh um	2776	B
so	2776	B
anyway	2776	B
i have to remember that	2776	B
yeah	2776	B
um-hum	2776	B
hum-um	2776	B
if you get a chance read Dr Cooper's book on controlling cholesterol	2776	B
that's a real good um he talks about that talks about	2776	B
high risk factors and heart disease and all that	2776	B
that's right	2776	B
uh-huh	2776	B
uh-huh	2776	B
you have a good ratio of good to bad cholesterol	2776	B
yeah	2776	B
huh	2776	B
oh really	2776	B
that's good	2776	B
yeah	2776	B
what what's the uh main way that you keep up with uh the current events	2704	A
right	2704	A
right to get the full benefit out of them_1	2704	A
right right	2704	A
exactly	2704	A
right	2704	A
i	2704	A
that's that's my main source also i uh usually get it when i'm going into work and uh read the paper real quick	2704	A
so that's uh that's usually my main source because_1 i sometimes i'm if i'm here i'm i'm in and out and can't really watch the news all the time	2704	A
right	2704	A
right	2704	A
exactly what do you think about the coverage uh	2704	A
does it sort of depend on the event what's going on	2704	A
oh okay yeah	2704	A
how they how they	2704	A
right	2704	A
huh	2704	A
yeah sometimes i guess they do have to jazz it up just a little bit for it to make uh news for people to read it yeah	2704	A
but uh	2704	A
accurate right	2704	A
well you know anymore they can they can be anywhere and and and almost talk to anyone instantly it seems like	2704	A
and uh man it seems like they can get about fifty different views you know of experts uh just in a matter of seconds uh	2704	A
right	2704	A
yeah you know with the Persian Gulf deal you know it's the first oh probably the first week or so we really watched CNN every night and	2704	A
it was really interesting then after a while i mean it just seemed like uh everybody was an expert on the the topic and uh	2704	A
right	2704	A
exactly exactly	2704	A
right right	2704	A
exactly	2704	A
you know in the- in the the Persian Gulf i think that is a a perfect example of uh the media being hungry for something to happen	2704	A
you know it's just- it had been so long since there been a a major event	2704	A
and	2704	A
you know i think it was because_1 uh and- and i don't know how accurate this is but i i heard that uh you know even Schwartzkopf and some of those guys was were watching CNN to to try to get some of the updates	2704	A
and that that just seemed outrageous you know that they'd they'd watch these reporters to	2704	A
to get updated	2704	A
exactly	2704	A
well yeah you know that- there's not enough money in the world for me to be up there in uh in probably the highest building in Baghdad while all these bombs are going off i mean	2704	A
that's right	2704	A
you know i i sort of have a tough time uh feeling sorry for those guys when they get captured over there	2704	A
i mean they're just almost asking for it when they when they sign up for these projects and	2704	A
right	2704	A
right	2704	A
oh yeah and those guys over there don't give a flip i mean uh what- what they going to you know what are we going to do go to war with them we already are and uh yeah	2704	A
so uh yeah it that and and the people working over there if if they've had plenty of warning and and had opportunities to leave then	2704	A
uh you know i i i'm sure there's certain circumstances where it's uh you know it's impossible but man some of those people just need take a hint and get out of there	2704	A
right	2704	A
yeah and and i think it's unfortunate that we have to risk some of our soldiers' lives to try to get them out you know after it's uh almost too late	2704	A
right	2704	A
exactly	2704	A
right right	2704	A
exactly	2704	A
yeah	2704	A
that's right	2704	A
that's right and you and you know i like the the sensational type stories you know and and uh the man the just like you were saying the media- media of all types just jumps uh jumps all over it	2704	A
right	2704	A
exactly	2704	A
right	2704	A
well you know sort of like this Kennedy deal going on where uh supposedly some nephew raped this girl well you know that's i think a lot of that's just you know the smut news coming out and and uh	2704	A
right right	2704	A
yeah and you know that's just uh and the media has jumped all over that	2704	A
but uh well i appreciate the conversation you have a good evening	2704	A
um um bye-bye	2704	A
oh i guess mostly uh really i get the	2704	B
i guess the headlines on the news and then i read the newspaper for a little more detail	2704	B
uh i used to take some news magazines but i found that i just didn't have enough time to really read them_1	2704	B
yeah yeah to get my money's worth out of it you know i'd	2704	B
i'd oh i was taking Newsweek for a long time and i'd read it a little bit and put it back for a while and you know first thing you know i'm reading a a three week old news magazine	2704	B
that got to be kind of silly so i cut that out	2704	B
but i do read the paper just oh just about every day	2704	B
um-hum	2704	B
yeah	2704	B
yeah yeah i'm i like to watch the news uh if- if i really know that something's going on because_1 like i say you you can kind of get the headlines and a pretty quick thumbnail sketch of what's going on	2704	B
but then i i like the paper because you do get more detail	2704	B
oh it- i tell you it-	2704	B
yeah i think it does i i tell you it's it's really interesting when	2704	B
when you are personally involved or or personally see something that happened and then gets reported on later	2704	B
it's it's you know i've i've kind of been in that situation a couple of times and it's	2704	B
it's interesting to see how the how the reporters and how- and how the other people you- you know yeah how they saw it as opposed to how you saw it	2704	B
and and sometimes it's uh you know sometimes it's just like i saw it and then again sometimes it's not	2704	B
yeah	2704	B
yeah but uh it's i don't know it's you know the problem is you really don't know i think so many times if if the coverage is accurate or it fair	2704	B
and that's that's the problem i guess uh	2704	B
uh-huh	2704	B
yeah	2704	B
oh yeah	2704	B
yeah it's uh it's- it's interesting to to hear from the experts you know the so-called experts but i think sometimes they tend to go a little overboard	2704	B
uh-huh	2704	B
yeah	2704	B
yeah it's kind of funny we were we were kind of discussing that at work one day and it- you know the the introduction to the experts that they have you know this is Mister Jones he's been working on this project for thirty years you know he knows all there is to know about it	2704	B
and we just kind of looked around at our project at TI and you know we've got people that have been on the project for a long time that you know don't know the first thing about what's going on	2704	B
so we're kind of quoting those guys and you know and everybody's having a good time with it	2704	B
so that just uh you know that's a a a little lesson on how the experts can be	2704	B
but uh i	2704	B
oh yeah yeah	2704	B
yeah	2704	B
yeah the the the media was more mobilized than the military was i think	2704	B
um-hum	2704	B
yeah	2704	B
yeah yeah	2704	B
well you know the the situation the way it was there for a while you know you had uh you had TV reports coming out of Baghdad and and that's	2704	B
to me that's unheard of you know that's that's crazy you you	2704	B
no huh-uh	2704	B
yeah because_1 here we are at- at- at all out war with a country and and we've got our own people right in the heart of that country you know right in the area that we're trying to blow out	2704	B
yeah	2704	B
oh yeah	2704	B
well the some of them_1 uh	2704	B
you- you know almost give the air of of arrogance you know just- oh you can't touch me i'm a reporter you know you don't want to touch me i'm a reporter but sometimes the crowd you know or the people just don't really respect that	2704	B
no huh-uh	2704	B
yeah yeah there's not much we can do	2704	B
well you can you get	2704	B
yeah	2704	B
yeah	2704	B
oh yeah really like i say if- you know if they've had enough enough ample time to get out and then they don't then you know that's that's their own problem you know whether it's	2704	B
yeah that's yeah yeah that's exactly right you know because that's exactly what we're doing	2704	B
they're they stay over there long after they've been warned to get out then they expect us to come and bail them_1 out which of course we have to do you know	2704	B
but uh no it's	2704	B
there's a lot of lot of sources for news and i guess a lot of sources of news there just	2704	B
oh you know news people every where all over it's just amazing	2704	B
i- i guess the i guess the American public probably more so than anybody else i know just has this this need this thirst for news you- you know i'm same way i i love to read the paper i like to read the editorials	2704	B
you should	2704	B
um-hum	2704	B
yeah	2704	B
yeah it's it's you know some- uh some of the stuff i don't i don't feel the need	2704	B
some of the news items i guess is what i'm saying i don't feel like are really newsworthy you know the the personal tragedies and that kind of things but	2704	B
you know but uh oh the big disasters and the big natural disasters and stuff yeah that's news but	2704	B
yeah yeah that	2704	B
yeah	2704	B
oh yeah that's just that's strictly National Inquirer stuff you know and i i don't care a thing about that i haven't read anything about it or or even watched anything about it	2704	B
but	2704	B
yeah yeah	2704	B
all right you too all right you too we'll see you later bye-bye	2704	B
now we have to talk about the savings and loans scandal	2779	A
do you have any strong opinions on that	2779	A
uh what are yours	2779	A
well i think there's a lot to be said for that point of view i i really think that congress turned on the taps and then there were lots of people there to carry away the water	2779	A
um	2779	A
well	2779	A
right	2779	A
he'll pay for it	2779	A
absolutely	2779	A
that	2779	A
uh-huh i think that would've been a much smarter way to handle it and the another thing that would've helped a lot would be to make certain that the people who were going to use the money	2779	A
that we were providing	2779	A
should've had there own at stake they should've have a lot more of their own capital on the line	2779	A
when they can leverage just a very small investment into millions of dollars worth of tax payers money and it's turning out to be a lot more than that	2779	A
and they have absolutely no incentive to uh treat it prudently they just uh hand it over to anybody who walks in and asks for it	2779	A
um-hum	2779	A
they have nothing to lose and everything to gain you see you know can keep lending and keep growing	2779	A
then they can take the big salaries and have the all the perks and uh entertainment and so forth and then	2779	A
oh if people don't pay them back it's no skin off their nose they just	2779	A
um-hum	2779	A
yes they don't they don't lose anything	2779	A
well uh i don't know what could've been done other than the uh insurance regulation but i certainly think that was a mistake and the um	2779	A
i also think it was a mistake to reimburse all depositors over a hundred thousand dollars when they were told up-front that that was was was the limit	2779	A
because uh the promise is	2779	A
yeah the promises don't mean anything now	2779	A
when the uh people put millions of dollars in some shaky operation	2779	A
uh they figure the tax payers will bail them out because they have	2779	A
hm	2779	A
absolutely	2779	A
uh i would've been in a little danger of	2779	A
uh you know i would've had to be very careful about where i put my money but i certainly would have	2779	A
been alert and i would not have just been chasing the highest percentage return	2779	A
on a CD	2779	A
yeah uh i don't think that'd be any great loss we could do without a few of those they don't seem to be providing very much useful uh service to people	2779	A
absolutely	2779	A
um-hum	2779	A
yes you would and uh uh i don't see why the for large sums of money why it should be any different from investing in a CD i- i mean in a	2779	A
uh mutual fund or a money market fund or something like that	2779	A
uh there are no guarantees on them	2779	A
you uh you trust that the broker won't sell because certain	2779	A
brokerage houses will guarantee at least up to a certain point the investments in the funds that they manage but uh then you're uh just at the mercy of them because they could go under	2779	A
that's right	2779	A
yeah	2779	A
um-hum well uh do you think that we're heading for another uh debacle of this sort in the uh insurance industry	2779	A
and we see	2779	A
um-hum	2779	A
well i don't know how we're going to bail them out because if we're already how many trillion dollars in the hole where's the money going to come from	2779	A
and yet the we've got this enormous uh first executive insurance company just sailing out here in California and um	2779	A
maybe the people who uh bought term insurance aren't going to lose anything except a few months premium but all those um people who have money invested in uh uh annuities	2779	A
for their retirement are going to be up a creek and i don't know who's going to bail them out	2779	A
there already- there already a few companies that had switched over from their own private plans to the first executive annuities that are not getting their benefit checks this time	2779	A
and the the state governor is saying that we're going to protect those people but how are we going to do that	2779	A
where the state itself is already in hock uh we're running thirteen million dollars no billion sorry thirteen billion dollars in the hole for the next fiscal year	2779	A
and you know we've got to come up with that money because_1 states can't run a deficit the way the federal government can and they're going to have to be laying people off out here in the state	2779	A
some of whom i don't think anybody will miss but when it gets down to teachers and cops it make a difference	2779	A
well the	2779	A
yeah i think that's absolutely they keep all their fancy uh perks in the legislature and they uh still do their and they still have all their uh	2779	A
i think it's something like twenty five uh people on the payroll per a legislator	2779	A
yeah i i came from- out here to California from Texas and i can very well remember people trying to change the Texas legislature to meet every year instead of every other year as the Texas constitution requires and people	2779	A
and i really feel that way about the California ones too	2779	A
that- i- i think that if they could all just take about a five year vacation and let things settle down maybe we could figure out what exactly we need and start over	2779	A
but anyway	2779	A
uh-huh	2779	A
yep i i would vote for that	2779	A
well it's been interesting talking to you and i think we're in pretty much agreement on this	2779	A
thanks for talking	2779	A
uh bye bye	2779	A
oh my goodness	2779	B
yes	2779	B
oh absolutely	2779	B
i i think uh it's all Congress' fault	2779	B
yep and i think the real problem wasn't the regulation which i supported but that they failed to similarly deregulate the insurance	2779	B
i mean i think that was the real mistake they should have seen that coming it's that was like giving away free money oh sure we'll continue to insure- insure you cheaply but you can you know do whatever you want with the way you loan the money	2779	B
and it should've been do whatever you want with the way you loan the money and by the way when you buy insurance you know they're going to be looking at how you do it	2779	B
right and then the guys who want to spend it that way sure they'll pay more for insurance	2779	B
yep	2779	B
um-hum	2779	B
right	2779	B
absolutely	2779	B
absolutely because_1 i mean their return is guaranteed	2779	B
yeah	2779	B
right	2779	B
um-hum	2779	B
um-hum	2779	B
sure in fact they've got a strong incentive to uh	2779	B
you know guarantee your money your deposits at six percent and go ahead and invest it in you know the junkiest bonds possible where the theoretical rate of return is high	2779	B
uh because if they win they win big and if they don't who cares they don't loose right	2779	B
yep yep i agree with you there too uh	2779	B
this this the whole concept of too big to fail it's just silly	2779	B
yep	2779	B
right	2779	B
that's right and i also think the first thing they should've clarified was that the tax payer would give you a hundred thousand dollar maximum i don't care how many accounts you've got	2779	B
right	2779	B
that's right and i mean it would've put these money brokers out of business	2779	B
which i mean certainly contributed um-hum	2779	B
yep	2779	B
um-hum	2779	B
i mean if you invest in stocks or whatever you know it's it's not just the responsibility of the broker it's your responsibility you know to know what you're investing in and the kinds of risks you're taking and it seems to me if you're going to put more than a hundred thousand dollars or whatever the limit's going to be	2779	B
in a bank that you should be aware i mean it's one thing to have insurance when you're protecting the little guy who doesn't have the time to make or the expertise to make these sorts of decisions but it's another thing to be you know supposedly you would think hope that the big depositors like	2779	B
voters and everybody else are supposed to be educated about what they're getting into	2779	B
right absolutely	2779	B
that's right	2779	B
that's right yeah	2779	B
yeah i mean there is like for the brokerage houses there is a degree of insurance that the brokerage won't go bankrupt and you'll lose your money but there's certainly no guarantee that for example uh the commercial paper that the money market you invest in won't become worthless and your and your stock price will go down	2779	B
and that's fair enough	2779	B
uh yes i mean there's got to be long long term consequences over this you know just because	2779	B
reimbursing this is going to be a substantial cost the banks are failing because of all their	2779	B
accounts that were these you know savings and loans and stuff right um so i mean this things just got to spread	2779	B
um-hum	2779	B
yep	2779	B
um-hum	2779	B
um	2779	B
yep it's a problem	2779	B
hm	2779	B
um-hum	2779	B
um-hum	2779	B
yeah	2779	B
um-hum well if only it would help you know pull the usual firemen for a scam	2779	B
right	2779	B
pay more taxes if the firemen go first	2779	B
yeah	2779	B
yeah	2779	B
hm	2779	B
hm	2779	B
that's right	2779	B
yep	2779	B
um-hum	2779	B
um-hum	2779	B
yep	2779	B
i think constitutional congress would be probably a good idea	2779	B
um-hum	2779	B
yeah it's been good	2779	B
yep i think so too	2779	B
we'll see you bye	2779	B
was a loud one	2757	B
i'm against it	2757	B
uh-huh	2757	B
yes	2757	B
there you can't enforce the laws you got why do you want to pass some more	2757	B
uh-huh	2757	B
that's correct i don't know how maybe i- that's i agree one hundred percent i just uh what irritates me i guess is that they keep wanting to pass gun control laws that do nothing but take away your your constitutional amendments	2757	B
and that is that is really not gun control is not the problem	2757	B
it's the people using the guns	2757	B
and all they're doing is look at this new Brady Bill	2757	B
the seven day waiting period that does not deter anybody who really that wants to buy a gun	2757	B
there's spots here in Austin	2757	B
on Sixth Street to Eleventh east- east of the interstate	2757	B
and you stand in an alley down there and buy anything you want	2757	B
i mean you know and	2757	B
whether you want guns drugs women anything	2757	B
uh	2757	B
yeah	2757	B
true	2757	B
you can make two phone calls if you know if you know anybody here in town uh	2757	B
you can make two phone calls and have automatic weapons	2757	B
the law's just you know it's	2757	B
they can't enforce what they have you know and i'm not a big fan of Peter Jennings peculiarly	2757	B
but he was on one of the on the talk shows one time they had Kennedy on there and Brady Mrs Gonzalez and some of the other liberals but you know	2757	B
and he he pulled this big stack of papers out that was about oh four feet tall he said these are all the current gun laws you have the books if you can't enforce these why do you think you can pass another one and enforce it	2757	B
but uh	2757	B
the Brady Bill won't do anything but just make it harder for the people that are honest to buy one those- those that are criminals which are the ones that are refusing guns in the first place uh they're not going to walk in and buy one anyway	2757	B
well uh the uh the proper solution is education of the masses	2757	B
you've got to educate the people in in using the weapons	2757	B
and you know our forefathers you know everybody carried a gun here in Texas	2757	B
you know for you know a couple of hundred years	2757	B
that's true unless of course there was you know	2757	B
sufficient- sufficient provocation which we have basically the same thing now it's just that all the honest people you know the citizens as it were no longer carry guns to defend themselves because only- only the criminals are	2757	B
oh yeah	2757	B
oh yeah uh i have a class one license	2757	B
for firearms and a friend of mine owns a gun shop in	2757	B
and i go up and help him you know work in the store and stuff like that and it it's amazing the number of people that are buying guns and the reason they're buying them is they want to give their wife one to carry in the car with them	2757	B
and that some of the woman will come in and they'll look around and they'll try and find a small one to fit inside their purse	2757	B
and	2757	B
well if you get one you know	2757	B
you're single i take it	2757	B
are you single i take it	2757	B
yeah okay	2757	B
yeah	2757	B
well my wife uh before we got married uh she didn't carry any sort of thing and uh	2757	B
i i've got uh	2757	B
i've acquired you know her you know bought several that i give her to carry one of them she carries in her purse	2757	B
and there's some in the car i i always have one in my truck when i'm driving any place	2757	B
you know knives or mace or something but uh	2757	B
well it's a sad state of affairs when have to but uh you know they're are more and more homes are getting broken into and everybody says well	2757	B
uh it's because of guns no it's not because of the guns it's because of the people and and actually they're breaking in	2757	B
to the homes and and using weapons uh to buy drugs although you do have those that you know like the idiot who ran out and grabbed that AK-47 and shot everybody up at the McDonald's in California	2757	B
you know that you know we're talking about somebody whose crazy having a gun law is not going to stop him because he's going to find one	2757	B
and uh	2757	B
yeah well you know uh California	2757	B
California Hawaii and New York state have these and uh	2757	B
now New Jersey had the stiffest gun laws	2757	B
oh yeah but you know where where are the most crimes committed New York state	2757	B
as you know uh John Lennon was you know you know was shot and killed	2757	B
in uh New York by a guy that bought a gun in- in Hawaii which has a tough gun law	2757	B
and you know i mean this clown out in uh California he uh he had a criminal record you know a mile long	2757	B
but he still had not one but several	2757	B
and there was one not too long ago in the last six months uh	2757	B
he shot up that Allstate or or or that GMC credit place in Florida	2757	B
well he went out and bought six different guns	2757	B
you know and he had a criminal record	2757	B
oh yeah	2757	B
and there are people-	2757	B
yeah they're people doing that so i mean the the solution is not to pass more laws than you can't enforce because they're they're going to pass one now they're trying too either the Staggers Bill or the Brady Bill	2757	B
either way they do it it's going to cost you and me more money	2757	B
because- and and and we're going to increase the bureaucracy that's supposed to handle it and	2757	B
what are they going to do they're going to punch your name in the computer and you're going to come up as no you're not a criminal and no and no you have no criminal record you know and yeah you can by gun	2757	B
but that doesn't say that you're not going to walk outside and three days later shoot somebody	2757	B
you know there's no substitute for people	2757	B
oh yeah	2757	B
actually guns are not the prime uh weapon used in killing people in crimes of passion or whatever	2757	B
it's knives and baseball bats	2757	B
yeah	2757	B
oh yeah	2757	B
see you can walk down the street carrying a baseball bat and nobody thinks anything about it	2757	B
you know and how many times have you seen people walking down the street carrying a baseball bat	2757	B
you figure what little leaguers on their way to practice	2757	B
they could be gang members just as easy	2757	B
if you	2757	B
oh yeah it's uh it's quite a deal	2757	B
nobody pays attention to a baseball bat	2757	B
you know	2757	B
and you you you see a baseball bat in the back of the car and nobody no cops going to give you a ticket for a baseball bat in the back of your car	2757	B
yeah so why you know	2757	B
yeah	2757	B
or knives you can have knives everybody's got knives course you course you're limited you know you can't have switchblades and stuff	2757	B
but uh	2757	B
uh you know guns are used but so is everything else	2757	B
if you're going to ban that if you're going to band guns i've got an article in the Wall Street Journal where they had where they had uh used a satire	2757	B
where someone in New York had suggested all the guns because they were used for commission of drug regulated crimes	2757	B
and they immediately decided well lets start banning the public telephones	2757	B
bless you	2757	B
and they said well let's band the public telephones too because the public telephones are used in the commission of drug related crimes	2757	B
makes about as much sense	2757	B
but you know the to my way of thinking you know uh i'm a i'm you know i put blood on the ground you know the United States	2757	B
and uh if the- if the United States does not trust me enough to have a gun after that then i don't trust them enough to govern me	2757	B
but i'm kind of radical on that i just you know	2757	B
well i i see too much of it and i see people come into the shop up there and you know and i buy guns and they haven't got the faintest idea what you are doing	2757	B
you know and they want to buy a gun now i think there should be some sort of uh ID card that you carry	2757	B
there's an application you fill out now	2757	B
it's a yellow form	2757	B
but uh see that's it's just another piece of paperwork it asks for your name your address and phone number and the county where you birth and all and you know and then there's a list of ten questions you answer and	2757	B
if you answer no to all of them that means you're a good American	2757	B
you such um seriously and	2757	B
it's a little yellow form you fill out and it puts the name and the serial number the gun who bought it and the date like that and that stays in the gun shop and it never goes anywhere	2757	B
it stays right there we've got boxes full in the back room	2757	B
and and the only thing that it's used for is if uh if Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms come down and does an inspection	2757	B
they look through and if they look through your legal logbook you have to log it down in and out well you got	2757	B
and they look- and they	2757	B
they don't come out very often	2757	B
i've seen them once in about five years	2757	B
but they come down once-	2757	B
okay uh where do you stand on gun control	2757	A
again- your a one then	2757	A
uh-huh i i uh your against gun control why- why	2757	A
that's a good that's a very good point very good point i personally	2757	A
i guess i would be a five they said pick a one to ten	2757	A
uh because i i'm i think i'm dead smack in the middle i think that	2757	A
if there is going to be a ban on gun control that it should be enforced like you said and i feel like if there if if there is a band	2757	A
put upon us it wouldn't be a forced- enforced just like um there's suppose to be working on a drug problem suppose be working on our education problems	2757	A
things like that and those aren't being enforced but at the same time i want to see people protect themselves because things like the drug	2757	A
the drug war is not is not helping and i feel like i have to protect myself when i go out somewhere because there's so many people they're crazy people out there	2757	A
you know and so	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
exactly	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
right	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
wow	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
yeah it's just it's just like the drugs i mean they're legal	2757	A
but you can get them anywhere if you want it you can get it	2757	A
uh that is a shame	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
exactly exactly	2757	A
the reason i think i'm so cloudy on the issue is because i mean it it i want to protect myself but at the same time i don't want anyone to have a gun that could harm me	2757	A
you know what i'm saying	2757	A
and so	2757	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
exactly	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
right but everyone weren't they weren't going around killing each other	2757	A
trouble yeah	2757	A
but do you think more and more people now are carrying guns and weapons	2757	A
i mean just to i'm talking about the regular like	2757	A
Joe Blow on the street	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
right	2757	A
right uh-huh	2757	A
i mean you you have to because i i mean i don't have a gun it just scares me to have one but i feel like that very soon i'm going to have to go get one just because i would probably feel safer	2757	A
right now i have a knife under the seat in my car	2757	A
uh if i'm going anywhere at night anywhere i mean if i'm just stepping outside my door i carry something on me if i'm you know going up to my door and i don't have anything i put my keys in some kind of weapon like position in my hand you know	2757	A
i'm sorry	2757	A
yes yes i am um-hum i have a boyfriend but you know he's not always around	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
yes my boyfriend that that got me you know put the knives here and there and you know just different things and	2757	A
yeah and i have mace on my key chain i mean i have a lot of you know little things that	2757	A
but i don't i don't like to have to carry them_1 you know uh but you have to	2757	A
yeah	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
no no	2757	A
that's right	2757	A
that's right	2757	A
uh-huh uh-huh now that's just	2757	A
lunacy that's	2757	A
yeah	2757	A
he'll find some other way whether it's a gun or a bomb or what	2757	A
oh do they	2757	A
really	2757	A
um-hum	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
uh uh uh	2757	A
and still got a gun	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
right uh-huh	2757	A
uh	2757	A
and i mean if you find-	2757	A
if you offer a uh enough money to somebody they'll go get you a gun you know if your not eligible you know come to me offer me enough money i'll go get you a gun you know there's probably a lot of people like that	2757	A
yeah	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
um-hum	2757	A
right and not probably going to help too much	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
exactly	2757	A
a lot a lot of people that are in jail you know it's their first shooting or why do people you know not everybody has shot someone before	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
uh-huh baseball bats	2757	A
i didn't know that	2757	A
i could see knives yeah stabbings and things	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
yeah	2757	A
i didn't know baseball bats was like that huh	2757	A
uh	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
that's a very deadly weapon	2757	A
i mean one blow at that and	2757	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
i'm sorry	2757	A
very true	2757	A
a lot of sense	2757	A
uh	2757	A
um-hum	2757	A
right	2757	A
right	2757	A
you sound like you're pretty strongly	2757	A
yeah	2757	A
right	2757	A
what do you think about making some kind of application or something	2757	A
you know	2757	A
do you okay	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
yeah uh uh uh	2757	A
uh	2757	A
well that's a lot of help	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
and they probably really do that	2757	A
uh-huh	2757	A
oh my goodness	2757	A
scarily very very very seldom	2718	B
only in dire emergencies in fact i leave them home	2718	B
i have never	2718	B
uh	2718	B
i've used them but never to the extent of getting in debt like uh some people do	2718	B
it's just that since my money is tight right now	2718	B
i don't even give myself a tempting	2718	B
because_1 i've gotten them all paid off	2718	B
so now i just wait	2718	B
before i use it	2718	B
but um like i'll keep one minor one like Sears in my purse just for identification purposes	2718	B
because_1 i won't use it period	2718	B
if	2718	B
i'll use bank- uh Visa	2718	B
but otherwise huh-uh	2718	B
never	2718	B
never	2718	B
um-hum cash- check	2718	B
very seldom do i even use cash	2718	B
um-hum	2718	B
how about_1 you	2718	B
see that's exactly i didn't get in debt but what i did was one year oh i can't remember when five six must be eight nine years ago	2718	B
when i paid my taxes i realized that i had ran up so much on my credit card that i was paying interest that was	2718	B
ridiculous i mean sure it was the tax write-off but	2718	B
there was no sense to it	2718	B
i mean there was no sense at all to it i was paying more interest on that card than the card was worth as far as i could tell	2718	B
so at that point there we just stepped right on you know just saving all the way in and i'll turn around like on my car i'll borrow	2718	B
against my insurance which i pay five percent interest	2718	B
and buy my car that way	2718	B
and that works	2718	B
so i don't have to worry about it but i use uh override at uh Texin Credit Union	2718	B
so that i don't have to keep too much i keep enough balance in my checking account so i don't have to pay	2718	B
you know a service charge	2718	B
and then i yeah	2718	B
if i write a check real large it'll go ahead and pull it out of my savings account	2718	B
so i don't have to you know worry about it one way of the other and i just keep that minimum balance in there	2718	B
so it just you know and i pretty much budget that way all the way around but as i said my money's tight	2718	B
right now	2718	B
yeah	2718	B
there's no charge for it	2718	B
so i do it that way but i do as i said i keep the credit card in my purse for identification	2718	B
when somebody wants identification one way or the other	2718	B
but usually i won't put anything on that card unless it's something i really unbelievably need otherwise i better have it somewhere else	2718	B
because_1 i'm like you i'm not going to have a balance on that thing because_1 it's too easy	2718	B
i know too many people that pay off that card well i've got this credit card well maybe i'd better use that one or something like that and i'm saying huh-uh not me	2718	B
well it's like um the little piece of plastic for uh	2718	B
to get your money out or the credit union all you have to do is put it in the machine one way or the other	2718	B
and like i'll run down there like you know for vacation and things like that and i'll leave it in there in savings account till the last day	2718	B
and then i'll put the card in and pull it out what i want	2718	B
but i'll pull it out of savings because i don't keep any balance in the checking	2718	B
but that's still that's easy enough as it is but i wouldn't use the machine to pay fifty cents or a dollar for it	2718	B
i won't even go that far	2718	B
um	2718	B
but i'm like you if there's something	2718	B
really that i wanted	2718	B
i'll write to them_1 before i'll put the credit card call in though i won't put it on the card unless i really	2718	B
i'll take write them_1 letter- uh check for it	2718	B
because it wastes too much time	2718	B
on the credit card and i'm kind of i'm leery about things going on my card because_1 i've had	2718	B
you know had to go back and return something and it took so long to get it off and that was years ago	2718	B
so i'm having real good luck with a credit card	2718	B
i mean it came off there's no problem but it just takes too much	2718	B
scares me	2718	B
and like Tom Thumb's got uh credit card now they used for groceries	2718	B
yeah over here in in Plano	2718	B
uh-huh	2718	B
and you can charge your groceries on it	2718	B
and uh you can either charge your groceries on it you have a choice or you can write a check and they okayed it that way	2718	B
so you don't have to keep going and get it you know credit check and things like that and they'll give you an extra twenty five dollars no charge or anything else like that but i won't even put that on the groceries	2718	B
because hey what happens if the clerk marks in an extra number or something like that and i don't check it	2718	B
no thank you i don't want anything going on my card you know in my checking account unless it's i know about it	2718	B
but do you like Discover card i hadn't heard too much about it	2718	B
um-hum	2718	B
all right well how do you use credit cards Carol	2718	A
yeah	2718	A
uh-huh	2718	A
is that from past experience- bad experiences in the past or or just uh the fact that you don't want to be tempted	2718	A
uh-huh	2718	A
uh-huh	2718	A
yeah	2718	A
okay	2718	A
uh-huh	2718	A
but like if you'd take a trip or something	2718	A
yeah	2718	A
yeah do you	2718	A
do you order a lot of things over the phone or credit card orders never	2718	A
huh	2718	A
so uh like if you go to uh K Wal-Mart or something you always pay in cash or with a check	2718	A
cash	2718	A
-okay	2718	A
um so your money funnels directly into your checking account huh	2718	A
okay	2718	A
me i have a Discover card and i use that	2718	A
when when gas prices are the same whether you use cash or credit i usually use my Discover card and i can let my money sit in the bank for an extra	2718	A
because_1 they pay in our credit union pays at the end of the month on your balance so i will let it sit and then draw interest from that and then i'll pay my credit cards off in full every month	2718	A
so you know i have no finance charges as long as i pay off exactly on time which i do	2718	A
and also Discover card gives you a little bit of money back it's not much but you know five or six bucks uh instead of writing a check for a large purchase if i'm disciplined enough i can	2718	A
uh like well- uh like buying a suit if i spend like three hundred bucks you know i'll get some of that back through the	2718	A
cash back program and also at the end of the month you know i'll get my interest on that three hundred bucks that was sitting in my checking account that would be gone had i written a check	2718	A
and i do that sometimes but like when we go to the like uh i'd say it's about fifty fifty writing a check or using the Discover card	2718	A
it just i don't know for some reason it just depend- if it's something small i don't want to write a uh use my credit card but that's the only one i have and and sometimes we order things through the mail like books and uh	2718	A
which is i just if they have a toll free number i'll call it up and you know charge it to my credit card as- as long as	2718	A
you know i'd make myself pay on time every time so there's no finance charge and	2718	A
it's really you know like you said some people go off half wild and spend uh they think because they've got a thousand dollar limit then you know they've got to get that limit every month or something and uh they end up paying	2718	A
finance charges and they just and then they'll pay the minimum balance every month and then end up they may have got something on sale but all the interest you know they end up paying more than what they would have had they just paid cash for it	2718	A
uh-huh	2718	A
yeah	2718	A
yeah	2718	A
huh	2718	A
wow	2718	A
what you override	2718	A
what's that mean	2718	A
oh okay	2718	A
okay i see	2718	A
yeah is that a free service that override	2718	A
huh	2718	A
huh	2718	A
yeah	2718	A
it's	2718	A
right	2718	A
yeah	2718	A
it's just it's just so easy when uh	2718	A
okay i think a lot of it's psychological you hand a piece of plastic and all you do is sign your name at least either with cash or with a check you have to write out the amount	2718	A
so you actually see how much you're spending	2718	A
uh-huh	2718	A
yeah	2718	A
uh-huh	2718	A
oh yeah no kidding	2718	A
i complain every time i- i mean we've only had to do it twice since my wife and i've been married in nine months is use the machine that charges and it charges a buck and one time it was because_1 the machine at TI was broken	2718	A
and we had to have cash so we had no choice but to go to the other place and the other one was just this weekend when we just	2718	A
we were leaving out of town and we had to you know just have some cash and so we used the automatic teller card but you know i'm very chintzy with my money i don't like to spend lose a dollar just because i use a machine or something it's	2718	A
senseless	2718	A
yeah that's	2718	A
yeah	2718	A
yeah	2718	A
really	2718	A
their own Tom Thumb card	2718	A
that's funny	2718	A
uh-huh	2718	A
huh	2718	A
yeah yeah	2718	A
right	2718	A
yeah it seems a lot more places are taking it now which when i first got it it was a problem with it i- i said i don't want to use the credit card and i just carried it with me like you said for identification and sometimes when i would take it go on a trip you know it	2718	A
it was good to have a credit card because_1 like if my car breaks down or something a lot of states don't because i travel from Indiana to Texas and a lot of states won't take out of state checks like you know just some gas station out of the way	2718	A
they want cash or a major card so i went ahead and got that and there's no fee no service fee for it	2718	A
plus they play pay you cash back at the end of the i think i earned probably eight or nine bucks last year which isn't very much but i'd just started to use it and	2718	A
and like i- i had some major purchases i just was dumb and forgot to put on there like uh i wrote a check for my wife's wedding ring which was a lot of money and if i would have put it on the Discover card	2718	A
the money you know could have sat in the savings account or the checking account for an extra month and it also would have paid me probably you know eight or nine bucks back	2718	A
on uh the end of the year thing so i messed that up so i you know i'm still not in it's not a good habit to use it but fortunately i'm not uh	2718	A
like some people not a spendthrift and i really have to think about my purchases and i know if i have money in the checking account to cover it	2718	A
then i i'll use the Discover card you know to get a little more interest	2718	A
but uh	2718	A
yeah i i'm just very	2718	A
okay i uh i think in general that the the	2739	A
uh one of the biggest change in in uh the role of women in the last	2739	A
two generations is the fact that because of the uh	2739	A
of uh making ends meat even in a family that which has a two two parent family	2739	A
but many women work out of the home now	2739	A
and probably that is the biggest uh change of her role that she now has to	2739	A
um not only be uh mother	2739	A
um nurturer or whatever but she also has to to help earn the	2739	A
earn the income that comes into the home	2739	A
and uh and it has	2739	A
right	2739	A
it has uh	2739	A
uh	2739	A
has a lot of effect on a family and it can be positive and it can be very negative	2739	A
uh	2739	A
and uh i think a lot of the problems that we that we have in in school in education	2739	A
a lot of the problems we have in drugs a lot of the problems we have in in uh	2739	A
uh juvenile delinquency whatever probably can be laid right at that door	2739	A
because uh	2739	A
a child who does not have the kind of underpinnings that you can get	2739	A
uh with uh with a parent in the home whether it's the father or the mother	2739	A
uh it just does not have the same kind of opportunities as the one who does	2739	A
that's the kind of uh	2739	A
uh i think another thing it gives them the feeling of of uh the importance of their position	2739	A
as a child you know and and course most of their problems come from uh lack of ego	2739	A
as opposed to too much ego	2739	A
most of them_1 uh do things because they either want attention or because they	2739	A
they feel	2739	A
that they're not worthy	2739	A
and so they they do things that they're not	2739	A
not what the the norm would like them_1 to do	2739	A
so that it is always kind of negative	2739	A
what- what do you feel about how do you feel about the role of women being a man that make- that gives you a different	2739	A
that's right	2739	A
yeah i think that's probably-	2739	A
yeah i think so do do you have children	2739	A
no	2739	A
yeah	2739	A
i- i think that's probably true i think one of the problems is that that government in their	2739	A
meddling tends to encourage that	2739	A
instead of discourage it instead of giving you a break so that maybe a wife could stay home and do	2739	A
something satisfying in another area you know i- i think there are women who need to do things other than just	2739	A
be a mother but i think that's possible	2739	A
i mean i don't think that education or anything else starts at school it starts in your head	2739	A
and any anyplace you are you can educate be educated	2739	A
and so it- it doesn't mean they have to stop doing all the things that they might want to do and uh and so but	2739	A
but the environment	2739	A
no no nor do they have to stay home all the time	2739	A
there are lots of ways that they can that you can do this but the but the problem is that they have so little choice	2739	A
yeah	2739	A
yeah i think that's right i think that would be good	2739	A
right and have and have and and if if anybody is going to help them decide about uh about day care or something maybe it needs to be something worked out in uh in uh	2739	A
in uh um a workplace	2739	A
so that they can their children can go there so that they can see them so that they can have this uh you know during lunchtime or whatever	2739	A
some kind of a better uh contact and more uh a better feeling of of the fact that they are the important thing in this	2739	A
household as opposed to the work	2739	A
schedule being the important thing in this household	2739	A
um-hum	2739	A
i would imagine that's right	2739	A
that's right	2739	A
that's right it's not and and and the the problem is you see that- it isn't just the stress of the work but they- but they had plenty of stress before	2739	A
now they're just doubling their stress and that's- and that's really	2739	A
uh really more than you can take sometimes i think that's true that's true i- i think that uh	2739	A
uh	2739	A
there are a lot of really positive things about the changes about uh uh more women going for for uh better educations and uh	2739	A
all these things i think in uh in a person's life there are a lots of	2739	A
right and there are lots of of stages of your life where you can do things that you didn't do	2739	A
uh at some other time that uh if you're better prepared you're going to be able to take advantage of those things maybe later or or maybe during sometimes	2739	A
right	2739	A
yeah	2739	A
that's right i think so too with	2739	A
someone needs to do it that's the thing we just we just came from our son	2739	A
just graduated from uh from in his Master's degree and his wife is a nurse and he had just graduated in social services work and uh	2739	A
uh when she went back they just had a a baby in January and when she went back to work she says okay i'll work i'll work five days	2739	A
in two weeks but it has to be the times when he's home	2739	A
and so that one of them is taking care of this baby all the time but it's a neat thing to watch because he's as adept at it as she is	2739	A
and and equally as comfortable and i think that is a neat thing it it'll it'll be neat for the children too	2739	A
if you can get a relationship like that but where the where the husband is comfortable	2739	A
doing those things because children badly need more of that	2739	A
badly need more of that	2739	A
that's right badly more- well hey it's been good to talk to you	2739	A
yeah all right have a good day um-hum bye-bye	2739	A
um-hum	2739	B
um-hum	2739	B
um-hum	2739	B
um-hum	2739	B
oh i i'd agree with you i think that is one of the big big changes	2739	B
um-hum	2739	B
hum	2739	B
um-hum	2739	B
um-hum	2739	B
um-hum	2739	B
um-hum	2739	B
yep	2739	B
um-hum	2739	B
um-hum	2739	B
yep	2739	B
well i mean i- i- i agree with you substantially i think uh	2739	B
i think getting women because of you know declining standard of living we're not living as well as our parents did or making as much money um	2739	B
and um that was probably to a degree true for them i mean it's no longer the case where um many people can afford to have one parent	2739	B
stay at home and raise the kids or whatever so a lot of people are opting not to have kids or both parents are working and you got to rely on things like day care	2739	B
uh to raise the kids and certainly that's not going to be as stable an environment as uh when you do have a parent at home	2739	B
taking care of them_1 and i- i agree with you completely i think that's that's certainly having a lot of effects on our society	2739	B
um	2739	B
no i don't no i'm single	2739	B
um but um	2739	B
the- i mean i think that's one of the major things and i think that's had a lot of side effects in the way women get treated in society	2739	B
um	2739	B
i guess one of the things that	2739	B
we can concern ourselves with is is how	2739	B
things are likely to continue to change uh in the immediate future	2739	B
yeah	2739	B
yeah	2739	B
um-hum um-hum	2739	B
right	2739	B
um-hum um	2739	B
i agree with you i agree with you	2739	B
um-hum	2739	B
and i don't think it i don't think it even means that all women necessarily have to stay home and raise kids either you know i mean it should be optional	2739	B
right	2739	B
right well i'd like to see for example more flextime in the workplace i mean i think that would certainly help things	2739	B
um a greater acceptance of part-time jobs	2739	B
uh	2739	B
um-hum	2739	B
um-hum	2739	B
um	2739	B
yeah i think there's also a lot of interesting side effects to women having taken a more prominent position in the workplace i think it's changed the workplace in in a lot of respects	2739	B
and uh interestingly enough it also seems to have shortened uh women's life spans so there's	2739	B
there's there's something to be said about you know all the stress related kinds of things that that happen when you do have a full time job	2739	B
uh-huh	2739	B
that's right	2739	B
um-hum	2739	B
um-hum	2739	B
they have more freedom	2739	B
um-hum	2739	B
right	2739	B
well i also think there's no longer sort of this predisposition that the woman has to be the caretaker and the upbringer for the children i think that's starting to dissipate	2739	B
and i think that's good too i mean there's no reason why the father couldn't do it uh	2739	B
i- i agree with you that i think someone needs to do it that's important	2739	B
um-hum	2739	B
um-hum	2739	B
um-hum	2739	B
right yeah i think- i'm	2739	B
yep well i- i think it will help the kids be better adjusted when they grow up	2739	B
yeah it's been nice talking to you too	2739	B
you too bye	2739	B
is this one of your favorite topics	2728	A
yeah	2728	A
oh my my my son would love to find a woman like that i think	2728	A
yeah	2728	A
they have a way- they have a way of influencing your life	2728	A
what type what type of fishing did you enjoy	2728	A
um-hum	2728	A
oh is that right	2728	A
oh	2728	A
yeah do you do you like cartoons	2728	A
cartoons yes	2728	A
one of the my favorite cartoons is a picture of a a fellow in a	2728	A
pouring a downpour	2728	A
raining oh now the boat is half full of water	2728	A
there are beer cans floating all around and the the line is in the boat with him and he's got the biggest grin on his face you've ever seen	2728	A
no but when you say you enjoying- enjoying the rain that uh you must be in a warm weather climate then	2728	A
um-hum	2728	A
oh	2728	A
yeah have you ever done any the uh ocean fishing	2728	A
no	2728	A
oh i	2728	A
that's that's a nice sport too i think beautiful sights and it	2728	A
now the only offshore fishing i've done is from the Bahamas and caught a nice big barracuda	2728	A
yeah yeah interesting interesting time i've i've been in the Great Lakes too and caught some salmon there	2728	A
but i really enjoy farm pond fishing probably as as much as anything	2728	A
oh you you can get out and it a fairly large pond with a lot of stumps and everything good black bass fishing	2728	A
and i enjoy walking around the edge and	2728	A
trying to select a spot i've even done some uh tube fishing are you familiar with that	2728	A
that's an inner tube with	2728	A
a special seat in it	2728	A
and you wear waders and you have little fins that you kick around so you move- move manipulate yourself anywhere you want in a pond	2728	A
yeah it's a lot of fun it is and cooling	2728	A
you know the the uh water below helps keep you cool	2728	A
you may be baked in the sun in the upper half of your body but uh	2728	A
it's it's a nice relaxing way and	2728	A
gentle undulations of the water you know is it is nice i think	2728	A
but fishing is a good relaxing sport if you if you don't have patience i don't know if you would enjoy fishing because you	2728	A
yeah	2728	A
no and i think that's part of the lure is is just to be uh relaxed and with the world and no pressure not not worrying about whether you catch anything or not	2728	A
uh do your children fish	2728	A
um-hum	2728	A
no no	2728	A
trout fishing yeah that's fun too	2728	A
it it's a challenge to learn to use the different equipment a fly rod entirely different technique	2728	A
and i'm always amazed that you can catch a large trout on a hook that small	2728	A
yeah	2728	A
the	2728	A
oh yeah	2728	A
well you know in Virginia well they they do eat the Rock Bass though	2728	A
yeah i think if they if they cut around that red streak in it then you're in good shape um-hum	2728	A
well that's a hybrid right it's a salt water that migrated into the fresh	2728	A
yeah	2728	A
and that it was a big thing they call Stripers in Oklahoma	2728	A
and Rock Fish i know in Virginia	2728	A
and uh probably up up there too then	2728	A
have you ever done any surf casting	2728	A
that's fun	2728	A
um-hum i could stand all day on the surf and you just have a lot of weight on the end of it and you're fighting the undertow so there's some action going on whether it's the fish or not all the time	2728	A
and that's a a relaxing time too you-	2728	A
no uh-huh no the secret is to cast just over the break of the wave and then the undertow keeps the line moving outward in- in you know it stays there for the uh	2728	A
flounder or or some of the other special fish too	2728	A
it's good good exercise too	2728	A
yeah	2728	A
what	2728	A
oh yeah	2728	A
um-hum	2728	A
well	2728	A
yeah i hope uh that the future generations have places they can go	2728	A
it is it is and with all the pollution that we do have	2728	A
um	2728	A
yep	2728	A
right	2728	A
but Sally it's been nice talking to you and i hope you get to go fishing soon	2728	A
good night	2728	A
okay	2728	B
well i love to fish i haven't in the last few years but uh in fact	2728	B
well yeah- i really do enjoy it but i like i say i haven't been for years we used- when after we got married a couple of years after we got married we got a boat and we used to fish a lot and including- you know we skied too but	2728	B
after the kids came we stopped and um now i'm- i'm divorced so	2728	B
yeah they don't you know and especially when they're little like that it was difficult to have them_1 in the boat we were always worried something would happen so we didn't	2728	B
well i liked trolling the best i i mean i like moving so instead of just sitting in one spot and i really do like to fish in the rain	2728	B
yeah i and when it's not pouring i mean but when it's just a light rain i'm i really enjoy that and i find that you we use to catch a lot of fish when it was raining	2728	B
do i pardon me say that again- cartoons yes	2728	B
well see the thing is when when i i am from originally from Ohio and i met my husband in Iowa and we	2728	B
he was from Minnesota and we went on our honeymoon to Minnesota so it was well it was in August and so it was warm enough but uh	2728	B
i because_1 i don't enjoy cold weather at all so we- we uh we lived right by a lake and it was nice	2728	B
no i have not i lived in the Bahamas for a year but i didn't do any fishing we did some scuba diving but that's all	2728	B
yes it's	2728	B
it's it's gorgeous	2728	B
ooh how nice	2728	B
uh-huh	2728	B
oh	2728	B
i've never fished in a farm pond	2728	B
um	2728	B
um	2728	B
no uh-huh	2728	B
ooh	2728	B
oh how wonderful relaxing too huh	2728	B
oh that sounds great	2728	B
oh	2728	B
oh it sounds wonderful	2728	B
no i know- i know a lot of friends are really too hyper to fish they have to be moving all the time i think you have to be able to sit and and just enjoy yourself quietly if you can't do that you're not going to make a good fisherman	2728	B
right	2728	B
well	2728	B
real sad to say we don't as much as we i'm- i'm divorced and and uh since we've been to Texas we haven't now in Iowa when they were little my son i used to take him fishing and they both have you know gear and we've we've gone	2728	B
once or twice but and there's just not that many lakes around here that i'd be interested in in going to and so	2728	B
you know and uh i just uh we just haven't and not that they i think they both would- would like it they have gone with their dad and uh he lives in Arizona now and uh	2728	B
he lives in the Phoenix area and the mountains are real close and he's taken them up to the mountains and yeah	2728	B
yeah yeah and they've enjoyed it	2728	B
it is	2728	B
yes	2728	B
yeah isn't that it- that is amazing isn't it	2728	B
well i can remember when i was trolling i caught a and we couldn't eat this it was a a Rock Bass and of course they're not good to eat but i mean it was it was for me it was like a six pound fish and that was big for me and i was just tickled to death that	2728	B
to catch it we threw it back in but um that was i think the biggest fish i ever caught	2728	B
but	2728	B
well we don't- in Minnesota people just don't they don't eat them_1 for some reason so	2728	B
oh	2728	B
is that right see we didn't know that so we just threw it back in so	2728	B
yes it is	2728	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2728	B
yeah	2728	B
oh	2728	B
uh-huh	2728	B
yeah yeah	2728	B
no	2728	B
is it	2728	B
uh-huh	2728	B
would you have to repeatedly cast though in the no	2728	B
oh	2728	B
oh that sounds great	2728	B
well uh when i grew up when i was growing up my dad was an avid fisherman- fisherman and we had a boat and we would go out in Lake Erie because i'm from Ohio	2728	B
and we would fish that was before it was so polluted and so yucky it was a beautiful lake then and um we would we would fish and and my dad would i can remember even when we were interested- weren't interested in when we were younger and we'd play around the the the lake or around	2728	B
and we'd go up into go- uh Michigan and the rapids up there in Grand Rapids Michigan were just beautiful and he would fish he would get his you know his waders on his long boots and he would go out and we would just play by the water and just have a ball and he would fish and it was so gorgeous	2728	B
and that was one of my wonderful childhood memories	2728	B
yeah isn't that scary	2728	B
yeah	2728	B
yeah it it's bad Lake Erie when i haven't been home for several years but the last time i was home i was just so surprised to see how terrible Lake Erie was i mean it just was awful	2728	B
and it just makes you so sad because at one time it was just a beautiful lake	2728	B
and not too long ago really	2728	B
but	2728	B
it sure has	2728	B
well thank you and you have many good fishing days too	2728	B
bye night bye-bye	2728	B
all right	2748	B
oh recently let me think actually recently i've just done some you know	2748	B
touch up types of painting although i'm looking at a few of the ceilings like uh in the family room and uh i'm wondering if i should take that project on myself and that's a little harder uh	2748	B
yeah you know me well so yeah i do most of the painting myself uh you know uh outdoors no you know outdoors uh gets too high with you know have to hire a professional for that	2748	B
um what about you	2748	B
uh-huh	2748	B
oh okay	2748	B
so that that's a lot of uh yeah you've got your work laid out for you	2748	B
right well that's that's a good idea get get the pointing over with and then the carpet's going to go anyway	2748	B
right yeah well uh uh i'm thinking for this summer of	2748	B
uh i'm contemplating actually uh doing a lot of wallpaper i think in the basement you know what having a problem of the basement being finished but you know with uh	2748	B
it's being used as a recreation center it's uh it's constantly- either a matter of constantly touching up or maybe putting something more durable that i can wipe down and doesn't have to be painted all the time	2748	B
and so i'm thinking of maybe uh	2748	B
you know if i can find some fairly neutral tasteful wallpapers of maybe just papering and	2748	B
and that has seemed to work pretty well upstairs you know with with kids so it's uh you know it doesn't require that every year the house has to be repainted which usually i guess most people must paint about every two years	2748	B
oh really yeah i i don't know i always assumed	2748	B
yeah well yeah i think that's true i mean some of the areas haven't been touched since we moved in six years ago	2748	B
i know exterior paints really if it's done well uh two good coats and a primer uh i think uh exterior paint probably should last somewhere around seven to ten years i think	2748	B
uh i i thought so you know i would say no less than definitely no less than five i think if your exterior paint is peeling after a year or two then there's probably something going on with the wood uh	2748	B
i don't know uh that that's my impression people don't do the outsides as often i know in this neighborhood it seemed like last year everybody was going crazy to have their exterior painted and that was the the first time for most people	2748	B
uh yeah trim yeah the aluminum doesn't need to be painted but yeah the trim and most people were doing it last year for the first time and that was five years	2748	B
uh course the first- original coat was so bad that maybe five years even wouldn't have been necessary if it had been done correctly the first time you know	2748	B
uh interior i don't know i have known people that every about every two years they they redo their paint and i guess a lot of the the drywall in these houses soaks so much of the paint in	2748	B
and uh maybe in a older plastered house this wouldn't uh this would be too often but i think i think with the drywall they use now the plaster board really seems to soak in the paint	2748	B
so i'm not i'm not sure two years would be too often i don't want to do it that often-	2748	B
no no i don't want to it's a that's one of the things i don't enjoy painting that much i guess uh it's okay for a while but i find it gets it gets uh boring or tiring pretty quickly so yeah	2748	B
yeah yeah	2748	B
so	2748	B
yeah yeah	2748	B
no	2748	B
no no not at all i i i think that uh	2748	B
what uh the the work that i've done that's one reason i do it uh if if i really felt that it was going to be a sloppy job and i was sorry you afterward the way it looks i wouldn't attempt to take it on but	2748	B
uh there are a few tricks you know that you learn to use and i've found that uh	2748	B
the one sided paper type of tape that peels off is is just excellent i used to	2748	B
i used to try to edge when as i'd get up toward the ceilings and i found that's really impossible to do but when you use the the one edge paper uh	2748	B
it it really makes a nice neat job You know you let the paint dry for about a half an hour an hour and peel it off and it's a perfect clean line and and i've found that it can also be used	2748	B
uh well like i've gone back and i've painted after wallpaper has been put up around crown moldings and things like that	2748	B
and again the tape really comes in handy you just cover up anything you don't want paint to get on and paint and take it off and sometimes you can even reuse the tape it just peels off like those notepads type of thing	2748	B
no it's not a masking tape it's it's about uh you can get it in different widths i'd say the most narrow is about two inches and it gets about as wide as four inches	2748	B
the glue on it is not across the whole thing it's only across the top much like the yellow pads that you peel off	2748	B
and it just comes in big rolls and so if you're doing	2748	B
you don't want to get paint on the ceiling for example say you want the ceiling a different color you roll this tape all along the length of the room	2748	B
you paint right up against it you can even get it on the tape itself and then whenever the paint is dry most interior paints seem like they're dry within a a half an hour an hour you just peel this tape off and it's enough that	2748	B
enough glue or whatever is on it that it it stays while you're painting but it doesn't do any damage to paint or wallpaper that's underneath it	2748	B
so it's really good uh you know i've put it up along the uh well i've had borders up near the ceiling in the living room i've put the tape along there and then painted the crown molding and it didn't- didn't do any damage to the wallpaper	2748	B
uh so that's you know so i think there are a few little things uh different size brushes good brushes i guess a lot of people make the mistake i've found good brushes make a big difference	2748	B
uh	2748	B
oh i've had yes i've used those and i like those actually they cover a lot more area	2748	B
and they're not as you don't get drips as well you can get drips you have to be a little careful but they hold quite a bit of paint so i found you're not constantly dipping like with a brush	2748	B
and uh it goes on very nice and evenly like sometimes with brushes you can sort of see streaks if you get it too thick and you don't have splatters like with a roller	2748	B
so i do i do like those and sometimes i guess if you're good at it you could uh	2748	B
you could use it to inch up towards ceilings and things like that although i've never been that good at doing that i've found that the tape works best for me	2748	B
oh is that right	2748	B
uh-huh	2748	B
yeah	2748	B
yeah yeah well i don't yeah that's right i don't i don't know i guess maybe the trick with the pads on the ceiling is that	2748	B
you have to put a minimal amount of paint on there you probably aren't going to be able to cover as much of a surface as you would if you're doing it on a wall because if it drips you can just sort of smooth it all out uh	2748	B
and i haven't tried that but that's an idea because i find that ceilings are really difficult in terms of how you have to be positioned to do them and your arms are up so it's tiring uh	2748	B
yeah that's true uh so have you been happy with the painting that you've done or do you wish that you you had hired a professional or	2748	B
right	2748	B
yeah yeah	2748	B
right	2748	B
what- does scrubbing is that just is that to get smudges off so they	2748	B
yes so what have you painted recently	2748	A
well my kitchen ceiling has needed painting	2748	A
for uh four years now and i'm having painted the apartment that i left in Syracuse i i really hesitate to do ceilings because i get more paint on me than on on the the ceiling but	2748	A
now that they redid the roofs all of our ceilings need it because it popped a lot of nails	2748	A
so i think this summer i'm going to take on the kitchen first and then try to do the others because i want to pull up the carpeting and put hardwood all through the house	2748	A
so i think	2748	A
right i figure by by doing it before i put in the carpeting you know the carpet is so bad whatever i spill it's too bad	2748	A
right	2748	A
right	2748	A
oh i would hope not because it seems to me that it would get too thick	2748	A
uh and start peeling maybe	2748	A
i think it's should- i think i don't know my my impression is it's more like four years- four years it starts needing it and people usually get around to it at five or six years	2748	A
oh exterior that long that would be	2748	A
uh-huh	2748	A
but that's just trim right	2748	A
yeah	2748	A
right	2748	A
uh-huh	2748	A
right	2748	A
oh okay okay	2748	A
um	2748	A
i know i was going to say what a mess	2748	A
right right	2748	A
yeah well very good	2748	A
but	2748	A
small world	2748	A
anyway so uh and then you're pleased with your your jobs once you're done	2748	A
i mean you don't feel you should have paid somebody to do the same job you did anyway	2748	A
but this isn't masking tape	2748	A
oh	2748	A
uh-huh	2748	A
oh great	2748	A
uh-huh	2748	A
oh great	2748	A
do you ever use these pads	2748	A
i pad the paint on	2748	A
yeah	2748	A
right	2748	A
yeah	2748	A
right	2748	A
yeah	2748	A
um-hum um-hum	2748	A
right now even with tape i think i was just thinking of using the pads instead of a brush	2748	A
but for ceilings i did try it and and uh i got a lot of paint on the kitchen table i was trying to to just patch the the kitchen ceiling there	2748	A
yeah and so i have to learn how to use pads but i have a friend in Syracuse who who paints everything with pads and she does ceilings	2748	A
so i'm going to have to ask her what the trick is she'll probably say hire me to come down and do it	2748	A
right	2748	A
right	2748	A
right that's why i want to do the kitchen first i figure i can stand on the kitchen table	2748	A
no i i'm happy with it but i just don't do it very often or very much because it's so time consuming and because i am tend to be a perfectionist about it	2748	A
and you know what i figure is first i have to scrub the walls	2748	A
and i mean if you hire a painter they don't do that just	2748	A
no to	2748	A
ready to talk okay	2782	A
uh i want to talk about um our family budget and the times that it's worked and the times that it hasn't worked and give you a general description of it and you can help me out a little bit	2782	A
tell me how yours work	2782	A
well at the my i introduced you a little bit to it a few minutes ago when i said that we are uh we're on the east coast now	2782	A
my husband quit a perfectly wonderful job and decided that well we both decided we wanted to move to North Carolina	2782	A
and so naturally we put ourselves we looked at our budget	2782	A
and so what we did was draw up a budget that we thought uh was realistic and uh	2782	A
so we had to make some adjustments because we really are kind of looking for something that we want to do uh he wants to do that's satisfactory and we've been here seven months and he's still hasn't hit up on anything permanently	2782	A
so you see	2782	A
well we actually planned for about one year	2782	A
uh thank God because it never occurred	2782	A
it never occurred to us that it would take seven months	2782	A
and uh what we did was just uh decide what- how we had been spending our money before	2782	A
and then we put that on the computer and then we took about three months and uh and adjusted where we could come down and where we didn't want to come down	2782	A
and we really uh lessened it uh our living expenses uh more than what we thought we would	2782	A
but	2782	A
oh just our own design uh-huh	2782	A
and uh so but we've had budgets that didn't work when our uh you know of our first fifteen years or eighteen years of being married nothing worked	2782	A
we spent too much money until our kids- children went to college so	2782	A
so tell me about do you all uh have a budget	2782	A
wonderful-	2782	A
yes	2782	A
three and a two year old bang bang	2782	A
um-hum	2782	A
well i think that's important for your budget to be realistically- for it to work though you have to do something	2782	A
of course not	2782	A
well i found uh that in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget was not where we were concerned	2782	A
but where maybe our friends were concerned and our relatives and parents	2782	A
uh we we tended to want to keep on giving lavish gifts as we had done before	2782	A
yes	2782	A
well i really do i think you have to budget those things though	2782	A
yes	2782	A
exactly or know so much per month anyway	2782	A
and uh that really should be in your bank- but if you don't spend it it should be in your bank account at the end of the month	2782	A
oh no no no no you don't want the government to spend your money you want to be able	2782	A
well uh but i do realize that that is realistic for some people and it was for us many years- for many years	2782	A
uh and if and if that's the only way that will it will make you save and have a little nest egg at the end of the the year then doggone it that's what you should do	2782	A
um-hum um-hum	2782	A
well i was just reading an article in uh	2782	A
a North Carolina paper- paper today where a high school student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars worth of scholarships for herself by sitting up at night and typing at uh	2782	A
letters of applications to universities	2782	A
she was oh she was third out of a class of two hundred and twenty so it can be done	2782	A
where there's a will where there's a will there's a way right	2782	A
well i have enjoyed talking to you	2782	A
oh i know uh we'll have to stay home and mow the yard	2782	A
bye-bye	2782	A
i guess so okay	2782	B
okay_1	2782	B
yeah	2782	B
okay	2782	B
um-hum	2782	B
uh-huh	2782	B
yeah	2782	B
um-hum	2782	B
oh no that throws the budget out of whack real fast	2782	B
oh good	2782	B
really that was smart	2782	B
yeah	2782	B
um-hum	2782	B
oh uh-huh	2782	B
yeah	2782	B
wow that's great did you have a special program on your computer to do that or was this just your own design of	2782	B
uh-huh gosh	2782	B
yeah	2782	B
yeah	2782	B
yeah	2782	B
well we've been married for five and a half years and we started out without kids of course and found it much easier to save and used to do a lot more fun kinds of things that uh didn't really um	2782	B
you know have a real strict budget- but budget but uh the the about into our when- when- when- when we first got married we were in graduate school and we were just you know dirt poor	2782	B
then when we got our first jobs after about a year of marriage we decided we'd bank my salary so we could buy a house so we virtually did that for about two years which worked real well	2782	B
and moved to Texas and bought a house immediately you know which of course is now devalued with the housing market so i don't know if we we did a good thing to buy a house or not but at least we've got a place to live	2782	B
um so now since uh we have a three year old and a two year old now um	2782	B
uh-huh	2782	B
and we um have been just forced to budget much more because i quit working to be home with the kids and um we just really have uh	2782	B
uh i don't know we've we've tried different times we've done like a survey of like taking you know the past three months of where all the money went	2782	B
and we really don't spend on anything much of a luxury or anything at all but it seems like there's um	2782	B
times when we just have to get out where we'll go and like get a babysitter and we'll go and we'll blow you know fifty sixty dollars in one night going out to eat going to a show or doing something you know	2782	B
yeah that's the hard part because_1 when we sit down to make it we try to make it real spartan and real narrow so we can put certain amount in savings every week and then it's not really that realistic because we do find that we want to go and do something or	2782	B
splurge for you know birthday for somebody or you know even we we even do things real frugally for the kids we get a lot of toys and clothes and stuff at garage sales or from friends because_1 they don't know the difference at this age you know whether they're Jordache new or whether they're	2782	B
you know something and they're both boys so they just fit one year after the other into each other's clothes so	2782	B
but um that's the hardest part for us is that it's really um you know budgeting and some extra things you know for that are more you know nonessential items	2782	B
um-hum	2782	B
yeah yeah	2782	B
um-hum	2782	B
on your friends that's true that's true well we have so many unexpected things come up so often it seems with we both have older cars and something will come up and we'll end up having to spend a thousand dollars you know on the car in two months or something and	2782	B
you know a lot of things like that that really is- are hard to plan for and uh	2782	B
yeah kind of put in a certain amount per year you're going to have on extra expenses for car and	2782	B
yeah yeah	2782	B
yeah our biggest way of saving money is then just have all these deductions um you know isn't- isn't let's see now i forget which way we do it we don't list all the deductions and then we get more money back you know at the end of the year	2782	B
that's what my husband said so this last year he changed it then of course we didn't get hardly i mean nearly as much back and it was like oh no we better find another way of saving money	2782	B
yeah	2782	B
yeah yeah	2782	B
yeah because we don't miss it we really don't when it's just taking out of the paycheck and stuff so	2782	B
gosh	2782	B
i guess that's fantastic	2782	B
yeah	2782	B
well i enjoyed talking to you too good luck and don't spend any money this weekend	2782	B
oh boy bye	2782	B
okay tell me about your home	2775	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2775	A
that's pretty tough	2775	A
what area do you live in	2775	A
oh okay i see is that pretty typical for your area	2775	A
it is	2775	A
uh-huh	2775	A
that sounds really interesting i live in a suburb of Dallas	2775	A
and um i live in the basic three bedroom two bath home so at least i have two bathrooms that's not so bad	2775	A
but uh it's pretty typical for the area as well	2775	A
um i've always been interested in older homes personally	2775	A
so it's i think you can end up you can end up doing more with them it seems like	2775	A
what is it what about uh yard space do you have lot of uh a big lot or anything like that	2775	A
oh i see	2775	A
hum-um oh that's nice	2775	A
because_1 i have just a like a very small you know those basic tract houses like that we have a very small yard and um i do have garden but it's it's extremely small	2775	A
but uh it seems like though for your area that's that's sort of different in a big city like that	2775	A
most houses i would think would be sort of like uh what we live in just a	2775	A
you know a basic tract house	2775	A
yeah	2775	A
that's exactly right that's the way we are we have uh one thing that we really do enjoy is we have a hot tub in the back so we have we have quite a few parties	2775	A
and uh it seems like everyone that lives around us ends up	2775	A
you know hearing every conversation that goes on outside you know with everyone so uh that's true that's one thing that i don't enjoy about it is the houses are too close together	2775	A
but uh you know it's it's fine for now hopefully eventually we'll move into a larger home	2775	A
the only thing that i don't like also is that the the rooms are so small	2775	A
you know it's it's very difficult to arrange furniture and and things like that so are are the rooms in your house bigger since it's a a sixties home it seems like uh then that they they built the rooms much larger is that true	2775	A
yeah	2775	A
yeah	2775	A
yeah that's really it that's a plus at least we do have uh like three walk-in closets here so that's	2775	A
that's maybe not so so typical but uh	2775	A
yeah it really does except when you you know have to fill them_1 up and then you get those Visa bills in and	2775	A
so anyway um anything else about the area about um	2775	A
you know that it compare- can- you can compare your house to anything around there	2775	A
yeah	2775	A
so it's just it's just	2775	A
yeah	2775	A
yeah	2775	A
that's nice that is nice	2775	A
but you know too the only bad thing about that is then you have to keep up you know you have	2775	A
the yard to deal with and	2775	A
do you	2775	A
you must have more time than than i have i'm sitting out here right now we had this terrible rain and i'm looking at the yard and seeing how tall the grass has gotten and it seems like now that's that's	2775	A
i almost wish i was in an apartment or something you know	2775	A
but uh yeah	2775	A
well um i don't know do we just terminate this or or do you have to talk for a a certain amount of time do you know	2775	A
okay okay	2775	A
well can you tell me anything else about the house	2775	A
are you working on it i mean do do people around that area seem to do a lot of renovation	2775	A
yeah that's that's nice	2775	A
yeah the the town that i came from is uh is a uh older town	2775	A
and it's like the typical the typical homes there are like you know early nineteen hundreds late eighteen hundreds	2775	A
and i renovated a house	2775	A
there and that was you know that was so much fun i mean there if you don't live in a house that's at least	2775	A
seventy five to hundred years old you know you're just	2775	A
you're just nobody practically and that was really it that was a good experience for me	2775	A
you learn a lot of discipline and	2775	A
and uh that was what considered typical for that area	2775	A
so uh it it's it was quite a change for me to come to a house like this now that's just you know a very square little box and you know there's not there's not a whole lot you can do with it but uh	2775	A
anyway	2775	A
yeah	2775	A
that's true	2775	A
oh really	2775	A
well i had lived in a small town for you know this this town was like less than ten thousand people	2775	A
and it was about sixty miles south of Dallas	2775	A
and i you know i didn't move out of there until i was you know twenty seven and out that was just	2775	A
you know so i- i love the big city because you know i had lived in a rural area for for so long so i've enjoyed it	2775	A
but uh it can get- it can get kind of tough it is like a rat race sometimes	2775	A
yeah	2775	A
yeah	2775	A
yeah	2775	A
it sounds like you enjoy working outside as well i i really yeah i really do enjoy that i haven't planted anything yet or	2775	A
you know i usually have got flowers coming out the gazoo but i've i haven't done that yet i've had finals this week so uh	2775	A
you know i'm just kind of been trying to	2775	A
trying to uh stick in with that but uh since that's over with now maybe i can	2775	A
i can get this yard in shape	2775	A
do you do a lot of gardening	2775	A
yeah	2775	A
yeah	2775	A
yeah	2775	A
i never have much luck with tomatoes i do i do plant a lot of beans because it seems like the the uh bugs get on them so easily	2775	A
and i have a real problem with anything pesticide- like pesticides or anything like that so	2775	A
the only thing that i use is soapy water you know spray the plants because_1 they say supposedly that will keep the bugs off them	2775	A
but uh i don't have luck with that on tomato plant so i hate to spray them with anything um what do you do do you have any tips you could give me	2775	A
yeah yeah	2775	A
that's true that's true i've my dad is a farmer so you know i've heard him talk about that forever	2775	A
i guess it works but um you have to really wash your vegetables after that	2775	A
so it won't make you sick	2775	A
let's see what else do you do to your house	2775	A
yeah	2775	A
oh really	2775	A
do you plan on uh like adding any rooms or you have enough space you could probably do that	2775	A
or is it	2775	A
yeah i would think so if you only have one bathroom for three bedrooms that's that's tough	2775	A
that's really tough- do you not like have a half bath	2775	A
yeah yeah that's that's rough the house that i used to live in had like one bath and a half	2775	A
and that was even just with two people that was a pain	2775	A
that's good	2775	A
really that that could account for a lot of marital problems i think you get to know each other very well if you have to share a bathroom	2775	A
no	2775	A
that's right it's it's not it does not make for a for a happy situation that's true well do you have any children	2775	A
one child and they enjoy they enjoy where they're living	2775	A
oh so he doesn't know right	2775	A
i guess he's a big help out in your garden right	2775	A
yeah	2775	A
that's right it's healthy why not	2775	A
yeah	2775	A
so you think that you want to move away from the big city huh	2775	A
yeah	2775	A
so you're just the opposite from me you want to go back to that huh	2775	A
yeah	2775	A
yeah so are you from Texas or you are	2775	A
so it's not you know that's that's true Houston in itself is a pretty tough place you	2775	A
well it's an older home it was made back in the early sixties it's a pier beam house	2775	B
got	2775	B
three bedrooms one bath and that just makes me scream	2775	B
i live in Houston	2775	B
well for the neighborhood i'm in yeah this is one- this is one of the more uh established neighborhoods	2775	B
well the whole- the whole lot i'm sitting on is roughly half an acre	2775	B
well half- about half of that about a quarter acre of that i've got a garden	2775	B
well in the um	2775	B
newer neighborhoods	2775	B
development communities that they've put together the houses are so close together if your neighbors having an argument you can hear it blow for blow	2775	B
and they've got better closet space than most of the new houses that i've seen	2775	B
it helps a bunch	2775	B
most of the neighborhood i'm in is pretty typical this whole neighborhood was kind of built in between sixty and sixty five	2775	B
so everybody's got a usually a pretty good size yard i think i've got probably the biggest	2775	B
if not the biggest yard i've got	2775	B
pretty close to it in the entire neighborhood	2775	B
well that's	2775	B
i enjoy that though	2775	B
praying for rain down here	2775	B
no we can the after you go to	2775	B
i think its five somewhere between five and ten minutes they'll get a little master recording on here that	2775	B
yeah this entire neighborhood everybody keeps the places up real nice	2775	B
wow	2775	B
living in the city- living in the city has some advantages but given the choice i'm getting out	2775	B
that's just something i'll never adapt to i don't	2775	B
i don't want to be a part of the rat race i want to be	2775	B
basically just kind of left alone if i want to if i want to sit around and mess mess with my garden i'll mess with my garden if i want to work in the flower beds fine	2775	B
very much	2775	B
uh oh	2775	B
uh	2775	B
landscaping more than the garden the gardening i've got my beans peas got some onions out	2775	B
tomatoes i'm not real sure what they're going to do this year	2775	B
um my favorite one is putting on the um	2775	B
tomato plant is to put uh seven dust	2775	B
and that stuff has been around since the beginning of time and	2775	B
well i've done some rewiring on it	2775	B
eventually i'm gonna have if if we stay here i'm gonna have to rewire the entire house	2775	B
i've talked well i've talked about adding at least one more room and definitely adding another bath on	2775	B
not even a half bath	2775	B
the only thing that saves it with the schedule i work and the schedule my wife works we're getting ready to go to work at different- totally different times	2775	B
so that it's not like we're tripping over each other in the morning trying to get ready	2775	B
yes	2775	B
it doesn't work if you're trying to shave and she's trying to put her eyeliner on and you're both fighting over the mirror	2775	B
got one	2775	B
we'll he's nine months old now	2775	B
uh he he likes to dig around a little bit then his mother comes in and says how- why did you let him play in the dirt like i said he was enjoying himself	2775	B
as long as he wasn't eating the dirt i wasn't to worry about it	2775	B
well that's what i've always i was raised up in a town about_1 ten thousand people	2775	B
and then after you're getting married	2775	B
move	2775	B
ended up moving to Houston- the Houston area	2775	B
yes	2775	B
okay um i- have- i have i purchased a gun um recently and um i wouldn't- i- i feel like that	2721	B
the way i feel about it that uh you know it would be nice if you get could get rid of guns completely although i do like to shoot them for sport but i don't think you're going to be able to do that and to make it difficult	2721	B
you know i think people are going to get guns uh no matter what some somewhere or other so make it difficult for the for the for the good people of the world i don't think it's going to solve the problem so that's my opinion	2721	B
really	2721	B
okay well yeah i	2721	B
well we have we have a very high crime rate here in Houston	2721	B
so we're dealing with uh	2721	B
situation	2721	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2721	B
well do you think though that i mean if you have to wait seven days in order to purchase a gun are they really going to do these background checks and and if they really	2721	B
i've heard about that but they say it's so so going to be so expensive they'll never do it	2721	B
yeah but what what's going to happen to the uh purchasing of guns illegally i meant i meant the guy who shot Brady was he had- he purchased his gun many months before he actually committed the deed	2721	B
that's true- they that may be true but if he wanted a gun	2721	B
i meant i meant you can purchase almost anything you want illegally meant there is a way to get it do you think he's not smart enough to figure that out	2721	B
don't think so	2721	B
um-hum	2721	B
um-hum	2721	B
right	2721	B
so you think maybe some of the people who are mentally incapacitated that will eliminate some of that which which really	2721	B
i mean if you can eliminate any you're doing	2721	B
you're doing well	2721	B
yeah that's true	2721	B
well yeah i'm you know i just you know i just couldn't understand what uh Sarah- Sarah Brady just needs something to do i mean this doesn't seem to be you know what is she really going to accomplish if this goes through i mean it's really not going to solve anything	2721	B
but if you're also talking- does this have anything her bill have anything to do with the automatic weapons yeah but it's a start	2721	B
you can't you can't do it all at once you has to do it gradually step by step	2721	B
i guess once this passes in some areas and then if you after a year or so you have some statistics to work on that would show that it that yeah it does work	2721	B
it has cut down at least in this area so maybe somebody else would want to	2721	B
but it doesn't uh won't do anything to uh in other words step if they you know i meant i- i still keep my gun and you keep your gun if you have one	2721	B
so it doesn't eliminate what's already out there but just	2721	B
right	2721	B
oh right	2721	B
right	2721	B
right	2721	B
hum	2721	B
that's true that's true	2721	B
so do you think there well i guess there are quite a few of those	2721	B
that's the unfortunate thing the innocent	2721	B
i meant not that anyone should die	2721	B
but how would how would anyone- how would how if i went to buy a gun and and i had been under the care of a psychologist for the last ten years how would they have a record of that	2721	B
i mean that's something that's privileged information that's doctor patient type thing	2721	B
so how how is that going to	2721	B
you know how how is that going to work	2721	B
oh it isn't you're really talking big bucks to start doing this kind of thing	2721	B
yeah	2721	B
but are are there are there uh uh an equal amount of per capita number of killings by other means	2721	B
yeah	2721	B
sure would be nice to feel safe again wouldn't it	2721	B
um-hum	2721	B
well i'm glad i talked to you because i have some i got some uh information from the other side because_1 i was	2721	B
um-hum	2721	A
yeah i think um i i'm a i'm an advocate of uh gun control um Maryland i think you'd be surprised is is very pro gun control	2721	A
yeah as a state in fact we have um they're now introducing some of the more most restrictive gun control laws here in Maryland and uh the um	2721	A
NRA did a nationwide- nationwide campaign to raise money to defeat uh Maryland's um local state laws and lost Maryland uh	2721	A
voted in favor to have gun- gun control here i think the problem is is because of um we have there's so much crime in the adjoining community of Washington DC	2721	A
that um we're hoping that they could you know if they put in more stricter laws then that crime won't reach out into Maryland which is in a sense a suburb of that um i guess they're experiencing now	2721	A
i don't know two murders or three murders a day in Washington DC normally associated with automatic weapons so i think that's the um that's the big press up in the Northeast is that they want to remove automatic weapons	2721	A
so yeah i can understand you know guns for and we everybody else in Maryland supports that and hopefully- and hopefully-	2721	A
yeah	2721	A
yeah i- i think what you'll find though is that the East Coast is very	2721	A
uh is pro gun control	2721	A
i know i am but like you know you're a hunter and you're a sport you're a sport hunter that's true and and that that's why you know in a sense	2721	A
how it doesn't it does inconvenience you but it could save lives i think is the way we look at it here and we're seeing so many murders um between uh in in Washington DC	2721	A
well i think the i think the long run is is to get um	2721	A
is to get and this is very active in the politics- politics here in Maryland now then the long run there's also there's a bill being trying to be passed right now i guess through federal- the federal legislature on um instant checkups a a total computerized system	2721	A
right and it's year it's years away but it- it will be	2721	A
it probably will be implemented on the East Coast first because the FBI headquarters is here in in Virginia and the this will probably be the places that will start to come in faster so yeah it will take a while before um	2721	A
it comes in but that's one reason why i guess the the plan is here in Maryland um because_1 i actually just received uh information from my um uh the um Brady Organization that um they want this seven day bill passed until	2721	A
the um the new bill until they can actually have a computerized system and i think the idea of the Brady Bill is to have this seven day waiting period to be able to check up on gun purchases or whatever	2721	A
um until they can do it automatically on a large computerized system	2721	A
oh sure that's	2721	A
that's true but he had uh he had a history of of depression and and suicidal behavior you know	2721	A
um-hum	2721	A
yeah	2721	A
well i don't think he would have been i think that his his type of crime i don't i don't think he would have been i think a street criminal would be you know like what you find in Washington DC	2721	A
they would be capable of doing it i don't think this fellow would have i think i think the idea is that they also um my idea too is to remove the automatic weapons from	2721	A
from the markets you know not to be able to purchase walk into a store and buy an automatic weapon	2721	A
right	2721	A
it'll it'll eliminate some of the you know that that type of crime or whatever yeah and	2721	A
right you can do anything yeah and i- i think that's	2721	A
you know in a sense uh i have friends that are peace activists and i'm not that extreme Everything they think that everything comes down to	2721	A
you know the whole world but i just think that right now we should do a little bit better checking and and um and i- i believe totally that automatic weapons should not be sold in this country	2721	A
um those are you know paramilitary i don't think even sport you know do you know anybody that sport hunts with a automatic weapon	2721	A
see and i don't either so and i do have friends my brother is a lifelong member of the NRA so it's fun you know it's um but it's just a belief you know i guess we all work towards um what we think will make it a better society	2721	A
um-hum and everybody's differences of opinion are probably good that's what makes our you know	2721	A
yeah	2721	A
no but it's a start i think i think what you i guess you have to look at things almost just like the i guess the like the pro life and pro choice is that you start with something and if you accomplish it then you increase your objectives and and you move to the next	2721	A
yeah you can't do it all at once	2721	A
yeah so once if you can um i guess if you can show the put a seven day waiting period in you can mobilize for that then you can also um uh if you show the weakness in the NRA which is a big lobby you know hopefully you can show enough weakness	2721	A
um from the the the gun control advocates you can show enough weakness that you can you know get the President to put a total ban on on assault weapons or the legislatures you know	2721	A
yeah well that's yeah	2721	A
um-hum	2721	A
right yeah and see now and if it doesn't work i would be the first one to say you know just like prohibition didn't work if it doesn't work i think i'd be one of the first ones to say okay you know it hasn't worked in five years it hasn't reduced any crime the statistics still show the same so	2721	A
um-hum	2721	A
yeah	2721	A
well see you already registered i think the idea is to get a better idea of who purchases guns um	2721	A
what type of person purchases what type of of gun and and and also you know the idea that somebody can go out you know a lot of the the mass murderers you know like that one fellow that walked into the Post Office purchased he was severely depressed	2721	A
um from he'd just lost his job um the he was severely depressed he'd been taking depressant drugs or whatever and he walked into a a store bought automatic weapons bought bullets drove immediately back to the Post Office and shot his former	2721	A
uh supervisor you know and i think the idea is if you put a seven day waiting period on some of these instant crimes you know this fellow may seek help before he murders you know ideas like that	2721	A
and you know in in all honesty i think all of us believe that uh that um uh you know people kill guns don't	2721	A
you know that i- i think but the idea is to is the the compulsive neurotic by gun killer	2721	A
there there are and and they always take a number of people with them so i	2721	A
yeah	2721	A
yeah see and in the back of my mind if we save one life if if you save one life you have to wait seven days probably less because if you have a clean record it probably would be faster than seven days you know but you have to wait seven	2721	A
you have to wait	2721	A
oh they probably wouldn't not yet they probably wouldn't	2721	A
um-hum	2721	A
um-hum	2721	A
well they might contact maybe an immediate member of your family and and ask them if you know they thought that you were capable	2721	A
sure yeah but i- i think it's worth it you know that's	2721	A
you know they have strict gun laws in- in London and they have and England and they have very few murders by by uh automatic weapons and and uh	2721	A
uh guns you know even the even the police for the longest time didn't really carry guns and all over Great Britain though the English	2721	A
no it's far less than what we have in the United States we're like the murder capital of the world in the civilized world you know above third world countries	2721	A
yeah and i don't know it's it's just who knows it's an argument i guess	2721	A
you know but i see that's the thing i totally a hundred percent see everybody's point my brother's a member of the NRA we argue about this over dinner	2721	A
and my mother and dad don't care one way or another so they just always say oh just shut up boys	2721	A
yeah well and you know what's really funny is that it	2721	A
uh well i'm kind of in the middle i lived in the Ozarks for a long time where a lot of people do a lot of hunting and uh	2700	B
now i live in Dallas where there's a lot of crime and i'm all for uh the average Joe being able to have a gun but then again i'm not you know as far as this seven day law and all this stuff for two weeks or whatever i'm all for that too i don't think anybody needs to be able to go buy a gun right away	2700	B
if you want a gun for a legitimate purpose you should be willing to wait	2700	B
long enough for someone to verify that you're not a	2700	B
a potential criminal	2700	B
yeah and i i don't think you know i think it's one of the constitutional rights that	2700	B
is important and you know we we should be allowed to have guns	2700	B
i don't think they should turn around and say you know the government says you can't have a gun because that just	2700	B
i don't know	2700	B
any any any country where they've ever revolted you know it takes guns to revolt and sure we don't need to but uh never know there might come a time	2700	B
so	2700	B
well they do that now i mean you're not supposed to have a hand guns well maybe you're allowed to have them say in the city but you're not allowed to use them in the city limits and things	2700	B
well what does that do to people that uh use it for protection like	2700	B
you know i personally i don't have a gun but i wouldn't mind having one i live in a neighborhood where the crime rate is going up somebody breaks in my house i wouldn't mind having a gun you know in self-defense but uh	2700	B
yeah yeah well i've never had it had to have one in the city you know when i was in the country we used them and out there was a necessity i mean you don't kill a copperhead with a rock	2700	B
you shoot them_1	2700	B
yeah	2700	B
i think there need to be stronger	2700	B
gun control laws that can be that can uh	2700	B
that uh what am i trying to say in in cities in urban areas	2700	B
but uh i don't think guns should be banned i just think it should be harder for for a criminal to get hold of them and of course the black market anyone can get one if they want one	2700	B
well that i guess that's the whole point of some of this legislation they're they're trying to make	2700	B
he turns around and yeah turns passes it on yeah there's no perfect answer	2700	B
but i guess i'm i'm more for- i'm more for no i'm actually more for less control because i think it's it's a right that that i would hate to see us lose	2700	B
and the more the more you give gun control the little bit the little bit of time before long you don't have anything	2700	B
i mean i'm sure when they started out with taxes they didn't plan on taking thirty percent of your income but uh	2700	B
they just start with a little bit you know	2700	B
yeah i don't know what the deal is on that i know you can't buy them any more you can't can't buy imported ones anyway	2700	B
or is it the other way around	2700	B
right right	2700	B
i don't see any reason for anybody to have one unless they're fighting a war you know	2700	B
right right	2700	B
right	2700	B
yeah i wouldn't need an Uzi though	2700	B
or a UB forty i mean a	2700	B
a pistol would be fine it's more for a scare tactic than anything else	2700	B
i don't really want to shoot somebody but i guess if uh it was me or him i would have to yeah	2700	B
course you've got people that are pulling them out on the highways down here	2700	B
it's like you cut them off and boom	2700	B
blow you away	2700	B
so you have to draw the line i guess	2700	B
i don't know	2700	B
so if we're supposed to pick a number i'd guess i'd pick oh what no gun control was	2700	B
was ten	2700	B
i guess i'd have to pick about an eight	2700	B
something down there toward the low end	2700	B
well supposedly in seven days they're going they're going to look through your background and make sure you are not an ex-con or don't have	2700	B
yeah i don't either it might stop some people but	2700	B
some people with a history of something but uh	2700	B
you know i guess there's a lot of information out there on everybody whether we we believe it or not they know everything you've done for the last	2700	B
ever since you got a social security number really	2700	B
so uh i guess they've got some time to make sure you haven't been in prison or don't have a history of	2700	B
you know i don't know	2700	B
i don't know i really don't know what the the actual on how how they work that out	2700	B
i imagine with the the way everything is computerized now it won't take much you know a perspective buyer comes in and they throw in your social security number on some nationally network system and it based on whatever criteria it's got it says yes or no	2700	B
this guy can get a gun or he can't and whoever decides those criterias you know that's something the legislatures do	2700	B
i really don't know	2700	B
i don't know what the you know what the status of those laws are	2700	B
yeah	2700	B
i would think if they're going to make a law it would have to be something uh	2700	B
it'd be a crime to uh not enforce it	2700	B
and	2700	B
all right uh	2700	B
take care yeah bye	2700	B
well how would you rate it	2700	A
um-hum	2700	A
yeah	2700	A
yeah that's true	2700	A
yeah that- that's true i'm i'm kind of like you you know i don't- i'm kind of in between but i i'd rather not rate it at all because i think it's very site specific	2700	A
yeah	2700	A
right it doesn't make sense if if you can govern yourself	2700	A
yeah well i think you know it's like you're saying is you know were- in in places in communities where hunting is common yeah you can't ban guns there it's not it's kind of impossible it's a way of life for people	2700	A
but uh	2700	A
in in cities i think there there may be a possibility for certain law restricting firearms in certain areas maybe not the ownership	2700	A
of such but it's restricting the you know the the uh presence of of hand guns in certain areas	2700	A
no that's what i'm saying like not have one in the city like you can have one but you can't have one in your apartment if it's you know cause you're in the city	2700	A
like you may have it at a summer home or somewhere else	2700	A
yeah just because you live in the city doesn't mean you can't have it but you just can't have it in the city	2700	A
well	2700	A
yeah well you know i see i don't know the statistics for that for	2700	A
you know how if if by having a gun how much that really helps so i don't really know that's why i think that maybe if not maybe not just having one will be better that's that's why	2700	A
i i wouldn't know because i'm not from the city	2700	A
so i don't i don't see the very high crime rate	2700	A
you on the other hand may have a different opinion	2700	A
right	2700	A
right	2700	A
exactly as you know as i'm i'm from uh you know rural	2700	A
so i i go hunting a lot	2700	A
uh-huh	2700	A
no	2700	A
yeah the bad things is that you know when you try to make it harder for criminals to get them how do you know if you're selling to a criminal or not	2700	A
yeah yeah i mean you can't- you can't ever really determine that i mean you can sell it to a straight person and and then he becomes a truant yeah yeah that's like shit	2700	A
more for some kind of control huh	2700	A
yeah well i don't want to see it	2700	A
but it sounds good to them	2700	A
yeah well i think you know maybe some kind of condition- some kind i think they should ban uh automatic weapons	2700	A
for you know only only and restrict them to uh gun clubs only	2700	A
i don't know if they've they've completed that action or not	2700	A
right	2700	A
and well uh i mean that doesn't really matter imported or or you know domestic machine guns they still do the same damage	2700	A
i don't see i don't see what the difference is myself you know getting shot by	2700	A
i mean in a gun club or something you know in a gun club or or have the wrong reason in mind those two are the	2700	A
that's why i think that maybe you know you if you say you can't have an automatic weapon that's that's also saying that you can't have a gun	2700	A
so if you say you can have it but you have to be a member of gun club that that restricts it even further	2700	A
doesn't doesn't take away your right it just puts a restriction on your right	2700	A
but	2700	A
i don't- you know i think i think restrictions are going to be needed but no no bans or anything like that	2700	A
it's kind of hard though because in different regions- different regions like you were saying is uh is different like there where you're at you wouldn't mind having a gun so you you're really	2700	A
you know	2700	A
yeah	2700	A
right	2700	A
it's a good deterrent	2700	A
yeah	2700	A
well total ban is one and uh no ban at all is ten	2700	A
yeah i think i think well around seven or eight restricting certain kinds and and leaving others out with restrictions but i don't know what that you know like you were saying the uh the seven day restriction or seven day wait period or something like that	2700	A
what does that mean that that really doesn't you know it's just because it gives them time to look you up doesn't mean i mean it	2700	A
it it may be well intended but i don't know how effective it is	2700	A
yeah that's true	2700	A
so then it's it's uh up to the the individual dealer	2700	A
yeah but what does does the uh does the retailer have the opportunity to you know disregard that information that he receives	2700	A
because you know if if it's if it's not against the law for the retailer to disregard that information that kind of defeats the whole purpose of the seven day wait period	2700	A
national	2700	A
right	2700	A
oh well man i guess that's about five minutes	2700	A
all right nice talking to you Ralph- Ralph bye	2700	A
well we uh uh this will be uh uh the reunion for not my grandfather but my great grandfather and then my great and then my grandfathers so it's a couple of generations	2750	A
um and these were pioneers who came across the plains	2750	A
and uh the families were are quite large and so we've had- we spent a lot of time trying to gather up	2750	A
uh names and addresses of all the tons of people that are involved	2750	A
and so it takes a lot of time and planning	2750	A
um good activity the what	2750	A
well interesting enough we're going to we're going to do it over an eight day period	2750	A
uh they will not everyone won't be there for the whole time but the families can come in during that eight day time and kind of meet on the on the living family level	2750	A
like i will come there kind of early and my brothers and sisters and their families will come so that we can get acquainted and then	2750	A
uh it goes back the the generation before will join us and they may meet kind of individually in this camping area	2750	A
and then uh toward the end of the week there will be two specific days when we honor these two uh	2750	A
uh groups my the grandfathers and the great grandfathers	2750	A
uh so it's kind of once more combining the whole group again	2750	A
but uh it's it's it's uh it requires a lot of uh logistics for food for the people who will have to meet	2750	A
and a lot of uh arranging for activities	2750	A
uh	2750	A
well uh course you want to do some kinds of things that which will help them to get to know the ancestor that you're honoring	2750	A
but besides that if you have a lot of children and and different ages you need to try to find things	2750	A
that uh that they will just have- like to do together so that the next time somebody says reunion they won't run like	2750	A
the four winds	2750	A
so it has to be pretty fun too i think uh we're we're going uh going to Utah to uh uh place near Park City	2750	A
and uh and it's a a pretty good size area where there'll be hiking and and then there will be uh	2750	A
oh just uh general kinds of things like uh swimming and whatever during the uh in the area roundabout which they will do during the days when they want to	2750	A
when they're not uh uh rehearsing or whatever for a part of the the play and then we'll kind of get together and and uh work out some small	2750	A
oh vignettes or or uh acts or things like that Musical numbers	2750	A
and the fact that we're together early during the week will help us to get together to prepare those things for the for the programs at the end of the week	2750	A
so it it we're real excited about it now always before we have only had my grandfather's family and uh	2750	A
we only did it for one day	2750	A
and uh the last time we doing- we were doing it every two years and we decided last time we would wait a third year because_1 it came across so often that it was kind of hard to get there and uh	2750	A
some people come from Back East and course i come from Texas so there's some of us come from quite a ways	2750	A
uh and so we we had a little longer and decided to try to hold it	2750	A
uh in a situation that was a little longer like a camping situation something that wasn't too expensive but	2750	A
uh could be more of a vacation situation for families to come and participate in while getting to know their ancestors and relatives	2750	A
uh so that maybe they'd be attracted more to bring their families	2750	A
now i've never gotten all my family to come before but this year i have uh several married daughters and and sons whose families are coming en masse so it it it looks to be a lot more interesting activity	2750	A
well uh the ancestors came from there	2750	A
and uh and we we were holding them there because there were some living ancestors up until	2750	A
uh fairly recently at this point in that generation that we're honoring	2750	A
there's only well my mother is ninety three and she won't go this year because it's just too hard on her	2750	A
but uh and there's one other wife but all of the all of the children are now gone they they've passed away in the meantime	2750	A
and so uh at that point we were going for that reason we were going there	2750	A
but it just there just more of them there still than there are other places the rest of us are kind of strung around some but we're- but you know if you if you're talking about convenient for the biggest majority it still is there	2750	A
also we had a we had a a the member who was in charge of it in general this time had some access to this park which was a big factor	2750	A
whether we'll be able to do it there again but there are other kind of arrangements like in in uh	2750	A
in some of the areas in Colorado you know where they ski in the winter time you can make some pretty good arrangements for uh for group uh activities and things like that	2750	A
so we might do something like that also sometimes universities will will rent out uh areas for doing things like that	2750	A
but uh	2750	A
well we knew generally the time of year uh that we wanted to do it in three years ago but we could not set the date until the first of January this year because this park where they have it	2750	A
uh they allow people in the vicinity to make their arrangements ahead of time and so we kind of had to take what was left	2750	A
uh i think you need to plan on you need to be sure and plan uh at least a year ahead of time or you're going to lose people	2750	A
you know they have to plan their vacations that far ahead a little bit	2750	A
if not exactly at least know generally what they're going to do	2750	A
well it's kind of important to to know quite a while ahead of time	2750	A
uh the last time we had one uh i was in charge of it and my goal was to write a history of my	2750	A
of my father and his brothers and sisters	2750	A
there was a history of his father and mother but there was no history on them so i spent the two years before that compiling and and writing the history and then we gave it out at that	2750	A
this year we're not we're we're combining it in the and the parents before and so we're going to do some um	2750	A
uh acting out of of these groups and try to help them get better acquainted and mostly it's a different kind of thing so we're we're just kind of playing it by ear and seeing how it goes i think	2750	A
but	2750	A
yeah we're kind of like we kind of uh well we like each other and we liked our families and so we figure they the little kids ought to get to know each other and	2750	A
and we are scattered enough there i have several children who live here but i also have children in in uh Nevada and Arizona	2750	A
so it's it's really neat to be able to get acquainted- get around with them you know	2750	A
and you're younger	2750	A
you have any family at all	2750	A
uh-huh	2750	A
not very many huh do you do you enjoy your do you enjoy your your wife's large family though	2750	A
was it is it	2750	A
yeah	2750	A
yeah	2750	A
yeah	2750	A
you don't feel quite involved huh	2750	A
yeah	2750	A
well you have to try it you'll like it	2750	A
it really is quite a lot of fun and uh um uh	2750	A
uh	2750	A
yeah	2750	A
yeah	2750	A
yeah yeah	2750	A
yeah	2750	A
cousins get really get really close sometimes almost closer than brothers and sisters sometimes	2750	A
especially-	2750	A
right especially if they live fairly close together so they get a chance to see each other	2750	A
it's kind of special	2750	A
um	2750	A
uh-huh	2750	A
yeah	2750	A
yeah	2750	A
all right well tell me all about your reunion planning	2750	B
uh-huh	2750	B
uh-huh	2750	B
are you going to do it over a weekend	2750	B
are you going to do it over a weekend or	2750	B
uh-huh	2750	B
right	2750	B
uh-huh	2750	B
uh-huh	2750	B
uh-huh	2750	B
what are some of the activities	2750	B
um-hum	2750	B
yeah yeah	2750	B
uh-huh	2750	B
yeah	2750	B
uh-huh	2750	B
yeah	2750	B
yeah	2750	B
um-hum	2750	B
this is what how did you pick uh	2750	B
the place in Utah is it central location or	2750	B
okay	2750	B
uh-huh	2750	B
uh-huh	2750	B
uh	2750	B
how	2750	B
yeah	2750	B
okay how long in advance did you set the date	2750	B
uh-huh	2750	B
yeah	2750	B
right	2750	B
okay	2750	B
uh-huh	2750	B
wow sounds like you guys are uh your family's really into family	2750	B
uh-huh	2750	B
wow	2750	B
yes	2750	B
uh well i'm married and uh my wife is from a large family	2750	B
but my family my mother's	2750	B
living and she has	2750	B
one brother that has no children that's living and my deceased father has one sister that has one child with and no other children so i have like four relatives	2750	B
not very many no	2750	B
it too it's it was a large transition let me tell you because_1 they had to meet one person they only had to meet me and i had to probably meet twenty five or thirty people	2750	B
so getting names and faces and jobs and where they live and everything straight was a quite a task uh	2750	B
i i still kind of balk at it because_1 they're really into family too and like	2750	B
well they try to involve me and if i allow myself to be involved you know i'll fit into the picture but uh they uh they make a big deal out of everything	2750	B
yeah uh i guess so uh	2750	B
yeah	2750	B
i'm just not used to it because our family has a reunion about once ever two years and and it's about a	2750	B
you know ten people show up so no one there's my age so i just kind of sit there and hang out but uh Carla has a lot of cousins	2750	B
that are our age and you know so we get	2750	B
it's yeah it seems that happened with their family	2750	B
right	2750	B
yeah there family was pretty well centralized everyone kind of stayed around the the uh the grandparents	2750	B
for at least for a while at least while they were growing up	2750	B
now they've kind of moved out a little bit but not too much	2750	B
so	2750	B
oh well what's there to say doesn't seem like it's being carried out very well in my opinion	2717	B
seems like it takes so long between	2717	B
conviction and carrying out the penalty that i don't see that it makes any difference to sentence anybody	2717	B
yeah	2717	B
yeah	2717	B
uh-huh well from what i understand- i saw a statistic just a few days ago um	2717	B
so far this year- year or was it during the last year somewhere- during a years time i think it was they executed twenty five people in the nation meanwhile there were twenty five hundred people on death row	2717	B
so i i and it's building up you know they're they're convicting them faster than they're executing them so it's really building up	2717	B
uh-huh	2717	B
yeah everybody's got that	2717	B
uh-huh	2717	B
yeah	2717	B
uh-huh	2717	B
yeah	2717	B
isn't isn't Maryland where the famous Willy Horton case was	2717	B
it was uh that was the one that was used so much in the campaign	2717	B
in the political- in the presidential race	2717	B
uh may it may not have been Maryland it may have been Massachusetts i don't remember	2717	B
anyway well the question is you know do you think it- it does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime or do you think it can if it's done right	2717	B
if it	2717	B
uh-huh	2717	B
yeah	2717	B
well i think in large measure the reason they don't care it's not because the punishment but so many of the people that commit crimes don't get punished	2717	B
the police don't catch them or the courts don't convict them or or they don't serve very much of the time and so uh	2717	B
you know their their success rate is very high crime does pay cash- you can make a good living at it	2717	B
yeah	2717	B
last year it was DC i guess Baltimore caught them	2717	B
uh-huh	2717	B
yeah	2717	B
yeah the only consolation is so many of the murders are you know the the violent people going against each other and so they you know society's not going to put them to death well at least maybe the guy they cross next time is going to	2717	B
uh i think	2717	B
i think capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for the kind of people where we say you know this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society and we are there by going to remove them from society not temporarily but permanently	2717	B
i mean i i personally think life imprisonment	2717	B
i don't think much of life- of life imprisonment first of all it's never turns out to be life but second you know why should we	2717	B
the idea of life imprisonment with no chance of parole well that means you're going to put them in a cage you think it's never ever going to be safe for them to walk the streets again well then	2717	B
why bother just execute them because that's that way you're sure they'll never ever going to walk the streets again	2717	B
so any any anybody that says life in prison with no chance of parole i'd say uh give them the death penalty	2717	B
so	2717	B
yeah and and also um	2717	B
the	2717	B
the thing i don't like about a lot of these court trials and a lot of these appeals is that it's not based on what is true and what is false but rather it's on the rules of evidence what can i hide and what do i have to tell	2717	B
and i think our courts should be geared much more strongly towards finding out the truth than they currently are	2717	B
and and that way we can be sure you know we can find out the truth we can find out what really happened	2717	B
and and base	2717	B
the verdict- sentence on what the person did not on what we're allowed to let the jury hear	2717	B
uh-huh	2717	B
uh-huh	2717	B
just started shooting people	2717	B
because they botched the first job and	2717	B
so now they're going to get even	2717	B
yeah	2717	B
uh-huh	2717	B
yeah	2717	B
so what was the verdict what was the results there	2717	B
oh	2717	B
uh-huh	2717	B
uh-huh	2717	B
the the penalty phase yeah they've decide the penalty separately from the verdict	2717	B
uh-huh	2717	B
yeah well you know you just have to decide you know what- you well yeah there's really two separate decisions there i guess one is did it really happen the way the the prosecutor said it happened	2717	B
you know is this man really guilty and you have to decide that but then you have to decide you know as a member of society what do i want to do with this guy who did this thing	2717	B
and that will- i i've never been on a jury i've never had that experience i'm not sure i'd look forward to making that kind of decision about a man's life	2717	B
uh-huh	2717	B
yeah	2717	B
well the thing i'd be most likely to attach the death penalty to is the violence i mean yeah- i can handle people people selling drugs you know it's it's wrong but	2717	B
it it's not worth somebody getting executed for but we hear so much about the violence and how it's not safe to walk the streets because somebody you know these random drive by shootings and that sort of thing	2717	B
and the people i'd most likely want to sentence to death are the people that just show a really low regard for human life	2717	B
that you know you never know when they're going to turn or hurt the next person because it doesn't really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt or not	2717	B
and so i go let's- you know these are the kind of people i would like to yeah- get out of here and get out of circulation and say i don't we don't accept your kind in our society	2717	B
uh-huh	2717	B
yeah	2717	B
i'll let you go first	2717	A
yeah it seems like they could die of old age waiting to get the death penalty	2717	A
yeah i know what you mean um i in Maryland they they do have capital punishment	2717	A
and uh i've seen uh a lot of people get convicted sentenced and then just nothing happens just endless endless endless appeals	2717	A
yeah what's amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years and uh here in Maryland i know we have a real problem with overcrowding in prisons	2717	A
uh just	2717	A
yeah but i mean in here it's uh to the point where they were letting prisoners go	2717	A
uh commuting the sentences of those that were in in jail for lesser crimes	2717	A
in order to put more people in into the jails and it was just uh amazing	2717	A
to me and of course they made a big deal out of the the few that got out and turned around and committed a crime within five days of getting out and	2717	A
being rearrested and	2717	A
uh	2717	A
i can't remember refresh my memory	2717	A
um i don't remember myself	2717	A
um	2717	A
i think if they if they started executing them on a regular basis	2717	A
uh that i think it might make a difference right now i don't see it making a difference i don't see someone not going out there	2717	A
and committing murder because they're afraid they're going to get sentenced to death i mean most people out there committing murders like don't care	2717	A
they just don't care	2717	A
yeah	2717	A
yeah yeah and there's uh there's a lot of people here in Baltimore that uh have and we just had uh a real big cocaine bust and	2717	A
of course you know they're they're playing it up real big that it was uh looked like it was a very very small ring and they just happened to get lucky and catch the guy	2717	A
but i mean uh Baltimore has uh an all time record for the number of deaths	2717	A
so far this year i think they've got over a hundred dead already this year	2717	A
well it's kind of it's kind of moved up and you have to remember that it it it	2717	A
uh there's i think X number of people out there that are going to commit murders	2717	A
and uh once you kill off a few of them i mean if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that i mean pretty soon you run out of people to murder	2717	A
yeah	2717	A
yeah	2717	A
yeah you know it makes sense	2717	A
um you know you have the occasional person who may have been falsely accused but i mean	2717	A
uh so few and far between uh you know makes good TV movies and that's about it	2717	A
yeah	2717	A
yeah	2717	A
yeah i had my uh my father-in-law participated in a uh a jury trial he was he was actually on the jury	2717	A
and uh this man was accused of killing uh i think it was two people uh and shooting a uh policeman	2717	A
um point blank in the face of course he didn't die and uh this was during a holdup of a uh uh a restaurant and it came out during the trial that um they had tried to rob another place	2717	A
and uh when the guy came out with the bag they thought was money it turned out to be a couple cookies	2717	A
and uh you know jumbo cookies and and so they were so upset from robbing this guy you know trying to do this holdup that didn't work	2717	A
that they quite literally were mad and went into a restaurant to hold the place up and just started you know shooting people	2717	A
you know it's	2717	A
yeah	2717	A
yeah and get even with who i mean you know stupid guys	2717	A
and uh it turned out that the you know policeman survived to the point that he was able to you know identify the guy	2717	A
and of course you know they tried to make the cop look out- like he was uh a uh no good rotten drunk	2717	A
i mean it was amazing	2717	A
oh he was found guilty yeah he uh um	2717	A
last i heard he uh	2717	A
he beat a push for the death penalty now whether they finally got it or not i don't know i kind of uh	2717	A
stopped listening after a while	2717	A
um you know he would come home and and you know after the trial was over he came home and told us what was going on and of course then they had to go back to decide- you know after	2717	A
he had to go	2717	A
right	2717	A
and uh yeah everybody everybody was pretty much you know let's burn him	2717	A
and that's you know that's the way they wanted to do it and he was surprised because he thought there was going to be a problem because he uh you know some people on the case were	2717	A
were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges but i mean when it all came down they just	2717	A
within an hour	2717	A
decided the man's fate	2717	A
yeah	2717	A
hm	2717	A
yeah well it it it went pretty pretty quick from what he said	2717	A
but i mean there's there's there's a lot of other crimes out there i mean besides murder i think uh now if you're dealing drugs now caught more than twice or something	2717	A
uh it there's uh a death penalty associated with it	2717	A
uh-huh	2717	A
yeah yeah i agree	2717	A
yeah i agree i i've i have uh a low tolerance for that kind of uh that kind of person	2717	A
and uh as far as uh you know there are some some other crimes that i think uh you know	2717	A
kidnapping um you know when they	2717	A
i mean kidnapping per se has a certain uh	2717	A
uh	2717	A
fine and penalty associated with it but	2717	A
um some of these people are just out and out brutal i some of the cases i've heard about over the years	2717	A
well i guess you said that you're you're a uh you're engaged so you really don't have a a family budget to manage right now right	2742	B
well that's good	2742	B
right oh that's good so you're really planning on uh how to how to manage money from the beginning and that's a a good time to start	2742	B
uh we've been married twenty five years and uh we find that uh you know money management is is really important we	2742	B
uh don't have a lot but we still you know manage it fairly well we don't have a formal budget	2742	B
uh we have just found that uh	2742	B
by trying to practice uh paying our bills every month uh especially our credit card accounts	2742	B
uh we don't spend more in a month than what we typically expect to be able to pay at the end of that month	2742	B
or when the bill comes	2742	B
we find that that works pretty well for the most part	2742	B
excuse me	2742	B
uh	2742	B
are are you planning on having a a real budget and and setting up a monthly monthly amount to spend or	2742	B
uh-huh	2742	B
uh-huh	2742	B
uh-huh	2742	B
uh-huh	2742	B
well now then i guess that's really you know the the idea of budgeting we know you know how much money's going to be coming in and we know what we have to spend so we	2742	B
don't uh you know we don't go out and spend a lot of money that for one thing when we need it for something else	2742	B
and uh i guess that's a budget in in a sense	2742	B
it's it's strange i'm an accountant and my wife manages most of the money so	2742	B
you know i manage other people's money but or or you know help them manage their money	2742	B
so i kind of let her manage ours and then you know if there's any questions come up you know we discuss it and work things out whatever needs to be worked out	2742	B
uh-huh	2742	B
uh-huh	2742	B
uh-huh	2742	B
yeah	2742	B
right it yeah you you have to i think that's the the a good idea for both you know both parties to know what the finances are	2742	B
then there's not ever any you know any uh question about whether or not the money can be spent or whether it's being spent properly or if one person knows that uh that if both parties know that	2742	B
what has to be spent then there's not going to be	2742	B
i've already said that no questions	2742	B
and and then plus if there's ever any uh you know tragedy or anything in the family then both parties are prepared to to take over control of the of the financial situation for themselves if they have to	2742	B
it's uh i've seen it uh seen it happen where	2742	B
you know people been married twenty twenty five years and	2742	B
one one party or the other managed the the money	2742	B
and you know something happens and the other one was left not knowing what was going on so you really need both of them	2742	B
uh-huh	2742	B
yeah	2742	B
yeah in just	2742	B
yeah well that's great	2742	B
uh-huh	2742	B
yeah so that's that's pretty good and it's you know it's good that you've got that that uh background of of managing and saving as much as you can with today's economy	2742	B
because you know things are so uncertain that you really have to watch you know be prepared to	2742	B
you know to cut spending when you have to	2742	B
but uh you know it's money management's really an important thing you know with today's with the situation the way it is	2742	B
right	2742	B
right	2742	B
yeah most most young young couples starting out think uh well i've got you know forty years before i need to think about retirement so they they plan on waiting you know half of that time and so they wind up	2742	B
when they you know twenty years later and they've already reached that point where they're spending everything they're making	2742	B
yeah and they well they they got their uh their lifestyle geared to to spending everything and they can't cut back enough to start saving so	2742	B
if you cut back to start with you you know you'll find you'll be surprised at how easy it is to you know if you start off saving and just continue to do that	2742	B
uh-huh	2742	B
uh-huh	2742	B
yeah	2742	B
so that's that's real good	2742	B
well any other anything else that we want to talk about on budgeting	2742	B
we seem to agree on everything	2742	B
that's that's good every once in a while you find somebody on these conversations that you don't agree with everything have to bite your tongue but	2742	B
okay	2742	B
well it's been nice talking to you	2742	B
yeah okay thank you bye-bye	2742	B
to- we're paying for our own wedding and everything	2742	A
so	2742	A
uh-huh	2742	A
uh-huh	2742	A
uh-huh	2742	A
uh i myself i don't do it i've been paying for my own college education also for the past four years so uh	2742	A
and my parents also have been married for twenty five years and i kind of picked up what they do they really don't have a formal budget like you do	2742	A
and they just pretty much know how much they have coming in you know and they just make sure they don't buy over	2742	A
and i'm pretty much like that also i don't buy a lot of luxury items i buy what i need and i buy it when it's on sale	2742	A
you know and i i don't go out of the way but my fiancee now he has a set budget that he goes by and he allots so much to each thing and it works out good for him but	2742	A
i think whenever like for the wedding we're doing this you know the wedding money we're doing together	2742	A
and uh we've actually sat down and wrote out how much everything's going to cost and you know making sure we have enough for everything and going from there	2742	A
uh-huh	2742	A
uh-huh	2742	A
uh-huh well see uh well like i said he he does computer- he's with computer work and i'm a finance manager	2742	A
but uh	2742	A
we decided that we would kind of share like the books you know	2742	A
he he he doesn't like the idea that i would just do all of it and i don't mind you know him helping with it either i think it's just pretty much going to be i think most couples you know it's not	2742	A
it's it's not like one person doesn't know what's in there at any time you know	2742	A
yeah	2742	A
uh-huh	2742	A
uh-huh	2742	A
yeah	2742	A
uh-huh	2742	A
uh-huh	2742	A
yeah well he's been on his own for probably oh it's been four years now	2742	A
so he is able you know to manage the money uh since we've decided to get married and stuff he hasn't been as carefree with his money like he used to he used to be really carefree with it and	2742	A
like i well my my i came from a family we my mom had twelve children	2742	A
and my dad didn't start out as a out as with a high paying job you know so she cut pennies wherever she could	2742	A
you know and i i've learned that from her and and it's really helping out now because in the you know	2742	A
in the in a matter of a year and a half we've we've been managed to save it's going to be almost enough to pay for our entire wedding you know and we're talking five or six thousand dollars saving in a year and a half	2742	A
uh-huh	2742	A
yeah	2742	A
uh-huh	2742	A
uh-huh and i know a a lot of couples starting out uh i don't think they really think about	2742	A
saving any either	2742	A
you know and uh	2742	A
now i know you know as my mom and dad that's been a big part on them and i think it will be a big part on us also but i know a lot of couples don't even think about it or retirement or you know or in case an accident would occur	2742	A
uh-huh	2742	A
yeah and they say oh well we have the money we might as well spend it now	2742	A
uh-huh	2742	A
yeah it is really pretty easy i mean myself i'm a college student and i get loans you know i i don't receive grants but i do have loans and just in the matter since uh Christmas	2742	A
i've managed to pay about five hundred dollars on my wedding dress myself you know and it it's amazing where you can cut your pennies and you know	2742	A
no i	2742	A
yeah	2742	A
uh-huh	2742	A
well i really can't think of anything else on it	2742	A
it's been really nice talking to you too uh-huh bye-bye	2742	A
are do you work outside the home	2758	A
and do you have small children	2758	A
oh okay	2758	A
i uh i also work outside the home full time	2758	A
i- i do have small children though	2758	A
it makes- it does make it very difficult i think that um our culture has um	2758	A
broadened quite a bit so that it is very acceptable for a woman to do so	2758	A
and um	2758	A
um well yeah yeah- but i didn't i	2758	A
i never found it difficult	2758	A
as a woman my i'm i'm in the medical field and so i don't i i'm not in a field that is typically a man's field i'm not a surgeon i'm not a doctor um	2758	A
and so i- i haven't um oh breached anybody's confidence on i haven't tried in you know going into a man's	2758	A
what is typically a man's role are you in a are you in a job that	2758	A
yeah	2758	A
yeah it it	2758	A
um-hum	2758	A
um-hum	2758	A
oh i'm sure	2758	A
um-hum	2758	A
yeah	2758	A
um-hum	2758	A
uh for me personally i don't think that um	2758	A
my sex really has much to do with um	2758	A
with limiting me as a matter of fact my um employer wanted a female for my position	2758	A
i do have trouble um i'm a physician assistant which is	2758	A
somewhere between a nurse and a doctor	2758	A
and i um i frequently see patients without the doctor seeing them	2758	A
and it is a it's not uncommon that the um	2758	A
it's- it's typically Hispanic males	2758	A
typically Hispanic males do not want me to be their medical you know provider- their their medical care provider that day	2758	A
they um they really have a problem with it and they'll and they will almost always ask me to see the doctor	2758	A
well not not when you think of their culture though	2758	A
and their culture- i i'm talking about the ones who came from Mexico not the ones that were reared in the states	2758	A
i'm talking primarily about um you know the the guys that are over here on work thesis	2758	A
you know that sort of thing but their culture is still very much though	2758	A
yeah so they um	2758	A
so that's that's that's the only place i've ever even had a problem	2758	A
regarding my sex sometimes my size is one limitation because_1 i assist in surgery too	2758	A
sometimes i wish i were strong as a man but um or the average man anyway	2758	A
um-hum	2758	A
um-hum	2758	A
i don't i don't	2758	A
i don't see how i can ever get back on track i don't see that as being a possibility i will i will never work	2758	A
seventy hour weeks again	2758	A
i mean i don't i	2758	A
yeah seventy hour weeks every week i mean it was nothing i mean that was what i did every week and but i don't not only	2758	A
i mean i can't any longer my husband works a full time job outside the home too	2758	A
and not only i mean i- i physically cannot do it because of day care et cetera	2758	A
but i don't want to the desire is not there	2758	A
um and i am not someone i- i- i i didn't- i didn't think i had the desire to be a mother even	2758	A
and yet the children had transformed me and and and the mothering has transformed me to the point	2758	A
i don't if if something happened and i no longer had a job	2758	A
i don't even think i would go interview again	2758	A
i- i you know it's it's i mean i love what i do but i love my children so much more	2758	A
and there's	2758	A
there is a guilt that goes along with leaving them to in the hands of other people	2758	A
that aren't you	2758	A
there's a fear there too i'm not really afraid of what might be happening- happening to them	2758	A
in an in an abuse issue but i'm afraid of what they're missing i'm afraid of what	2758	A
of of what's not being uh you know uh	2758	A
discussed- discussed with them or what or what opportunities are missed	2758	A
that i could fill in	2758	A
so that fear's there	2758	A
yeah	2758	A
right see the kids	2758	A
just- just learn about me i mean learn what i want them to be learn the things that are truly important to me because if you just tell them it doesn't count	2758	A
it's what they see routinely that they remember	2758	A
it's that they see routinely that you deal with the you know with the gardener in a in a nice manner	2758	A
uh that they see routinely that you are	2758	A
um you know doing Bible study or prayer group or whatever you are	2758	A
they need to see that instead of you just telling them well after you go to bed at night i	2758	A
uh you know stuff envelopes envelopes for the Crippled Children's Association you know that doesn't count they need to see what it is you spend your time and your energy doing	2758	A
in order to get part of you otherwise they grow up with parts of their child care or there care givers	2758	A
um-hum	2758	A
yeah	2758	A
yeah it's it's it's a tough thing i don't if you if you have children you know	2758	A
um-hum	2758	A
it's incredible	2758	A
it's	2758	A
it is the most life changing experience i have ever ever i mean i- i had no idea i never even wanted children	2758	A
and uh then we were blessed with one in an expected fashion and i mean i just i- i can't believe it i mean i- i can't believe this is me	2758	A
and neither can anybody else	2758	A
it is absolutely phenomenal	2758	A
uh yes i do full time	2758	B
no i don't have any children	2758	B
no huh-uh	2758	B
um-hum	2758	B
oh my gosh	2758	B
uh-huh	2758	B
do you think it's gotten easier on you personally you know as far as	2758	B
at work	2758	B
uh you know other people how you interact it's gotten easier on you	2758	B
uh-huh	2758	B
oh uh-huh	2758	B
right	2758	B
yeah yeah right yeah- yeah i'm an engineer	2758	B
and so so i have i have uh uh problem even when i was going through school	2758	B
i found it to be a man's world and i got a lot of static from that	2758	B
my- and it my first few years at TI i found it to really be hard	2758	B
but now that i've been there for a while it's it's kind of a deal you have to prove yourself	2758	B
and after i've been there for a while now you know the guys i'm just kind of one of the guys i'm um you know respected and and and i do the same things they do	2758	B
i'm not sure- necessarily sure i get the pay the same pay but i'm pretty sure i do and	2758	B
and i feel a lot better about it i have a friend that had just turned forty five	2758	B
that's an engineer and she tells me horror stories	2758	B
of what it use to be like you know you know always getting um	2758	B
belligerent comments like you ought to be at home having babies instead of doing these blueprints and things like that things that would just make her cry at work	2758	B
but she couldn't cry in front of them because they'd do it more	2758	B
you know so she's	2758	B
she you know builds me up and says be a strong woman and and present yourself professionally and	2758	B
you know builds my confidence quite a bit	2758	B
so that's why i ask you that if if you thought maybe times his changed made it easier on you at at work	2758	B
um-hum	2758	B
um-hum	2758	B
uh-huh	2758	B
right	2758	B
uh-huh	2758	B
uh-huh	2758	B
that is so strange	2758	B
yeah	2758	B
right	2758	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2758	B
uh-huh	2758	B
yeah	2758	B
this little young girl yeah	2758	B
um-hum	2758	B
uh-huh	2758	B
yeah	2758	B
well let me ask you this how have um did children do you feel like children set you back or kind of went off track a little while	2758	B
you know this is this is women's- an issue i'm on a women's subcommittee and women's initiative subcommittee and we were discussing this last week matter of fact	2758	B
that certain women have taken career kind of jobs	2758	B
you know and and decided to go in and have one or two children and then got back on track	2758	B
and they didn't see that as a setback but	2758	B
uh-huh	2758	B
in other words if you wouldn't of had	2758	B
oh yeah that's what they were saying before they had children they were working like crazy people	2758	B
uh-huh	2758	B
right	2758	B
uh-huh	2758	B
uh-huh	2758	B
right	2758	B
yeah	2758	B
uh-huh right	2758	B
uh-huh i'd be okay	2758	B
yeah	2758	B
yeah	2758	B
right right	2758	B
and a fear	2758	B
um-hum	2758	B
yeah	2758	B
yeah- right	2758	B
yeah	2758	B
yeah	2758	B
yeah yeah i- i hear that uh there's all men in my group i'm	2758	B
i'm one of two women the secretary is a woman and	2758	B
these men a lot of them have uh small children either just one or or two you know babies because we're all fairly young and	2758	B
and i hear the men saying that a lot	2758	B
you know and i think that is a culture change that you know their lives have changed since they had children	2758	B
you know they don't want to work that sixty hours anymore they want to hurry up and get home you know i can't wait to get home so i can play with my son	2758	B
so and they have the same concerns as not necessary an abuse	2758	B
guilt but you know thinking well you know if i- i could spend more time then they could learn so much more	2758	B
you know	2758	B
yeah yeah	2758	B
um-hum right	2758	B
right	2758	B
uh-huh	2758	B
yeah	2758	B
uh-huh	2758	B
yeah yeah	2758	B
yeah yeah	2758	B
that's right their nannies and you know right day cares that's really interesting	2758	B
yeah i was going to say if uh when i get to that point i'm sure i'll know it i see it from day-to-day like i say the- the men are experiencing this	2758	B
you know a lot of them_1 one of them_1 just had a child within the last year and he has totally changed	2758	B
from this seventy hour work person to somebody that goes God i'm ready get out of here you know i need to go to day care	2758	B
and he routinely calls the day care during the day	2758	B
you know like can i talk to my daughter you know and and uh	2758	B
yeah	2758	B
uh-huh	2758	B
yeah	2758	B
that'll	2758	B
that'll be me too and my family they'll go oh my God you've got children are you fixing to have a child they won't believe it they'll pass	2758	B
i was afraid for a while she wasn't going to find anyone because they were all out on the golf course	2765	A
okay	2765	A
oh	2765	A
yeah i	2765	A
oh no	2765	A
yeah	2765	A
well near Dallas you're used to playing golf in the wind too	2765	A
yeah	2765	A
the biggest problem with it i think is time	2765	A
yeah and i i know that it's a four hour dedication	2765	A
it could be four hour relaxation or it could be gritting on your nerves which you're using that much time	2765	A
uh and not not having that much fun	2765	A
you know and i- i played tennis for exercise but i play golf for fun uh and	2765	A
apparently it's the attitude that you have that makes the big difference	2765	A
the uh	2765	A
i- i enjoy catching it too do you ever go out to the	2765	A
uh-huh	2765	A
uh-huh	2765	A
i keep wondering why i you can understand in sports like uh basketball or baseball or football there's an age	2765	A
uh position in there but i keep wondering why	2765	A
some of the real legends can't go just a little bit longer than they do	2765	A
right	2765	A
it the regular tour	2765	A
and they do mix some of them mix it but it's uh it it does amaze me sometimes just to see it i don't know whether it's a lack of concentration	2765	A
or particular muscle development or what but it seems to be uh	2765	A
i to me it's not a sport that you would	2765	A
be overwhelmed with muscle activity in it	2765	A
um-hum	2765	A
um-hum	2765	A
i tell you what it's a sport that has a great number of jokes though	2765	A
i as i said i play tennis and there are no tennis jokes i don't know if you can think of one at all	2765	A
but but there are a slew of golf jokes so it it indicated and it's great uh sport for equalizing the handicap system	2765	A
allows you to play competitively even though you don't play on the same level play competitively	2765	A
with just about anyone you know i can go out and stand a chance of winning a dime off of Jack Nicholas	2765	A
uh if	2765	A
the handicap system uh worked properly and it should so	2765	A
it's nice to be able to to uh compete	2765	A
and and be together with someone	2765	A
and yet	2765	A
have a basis for competitiveness such as uh ten cent be anything over a a dime i joke on so	2765	A
oh yes oh yeah	2765	A
well you know that's one of the other things i i'd i'm am fascinated sometimes two sports bring it to mind more quickly than any others but all the other	2765	A
functions that the human body performs really are are uh	2765	A
as equally amazing But when you start thinking about the eye hand coordination and trying to get a little sphere	2765	A
uh four hundred and twenty yards away into a little whole in about four shots	2765	A
and it's true you have loft of club and everything else but knowing how far to bring it back and the	2765	A
the concentration and all the things that go on in the human body to get it there	2765	A
yeah the same the same thing is true with basketball where a a fellows running along and runs and jumps up in the air and then pushes the basketball toward uh a hoop and it swishes through	2765	A
the- the- the human body is amazing and i think i'd like to see	2765	A
uh	2765	A
elements like that in almost everything i do and golf	2765	A
uh i walk down the fairways sometimes just thinking about that and then of course i'll miss the putt	2765	A
but	2765	A
we just moved here from from Oklahoma as a matter of fact and i'd been in Oklahoma for twenty years up in Enid	2765	A
but so uh i'm used to the wind too	2765	A
in fact that's the only- that areas the only place i know of that you really have to uh consider the wind on putts out on the grass green and everything else but the wind effect	2765	A
oh i know it i know we had just moved to Charlotte and uh i've gone to a couple of uh public courses uh we haven't settled in here yet we're just	2765	A
here temporarily but	2765	A
a	2765	A
the courses are beautiful and you can play just about year round on it too	2765	A
now Richardson maybe you can too	2765	A
yeah yeah	2765	A
in fact uh the last few years i've had	2765	A
in Oklahoma i went to Norman and it would play New Year's day down there now there it was stretching the imagination to enjoy it	2765	A
but at least i played	2765	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2765	A
well i have enjoyed talking to you	2765	A
yeah	2765	A
yeah yeah well that that's a good sport when people enjoy it because it can be very social at the same time	2765	A
good luck on the course	2765	A
bye	2765	A
oh really well it's it's raining in Texas right now in my area so there's probably not any golfers out on the course	2765	B
uh	2765	B
they just they just said that the uh Byron Nelson Tournament here had been suspended	2765	B
for because of rain of course that's just for today it'll it'll play again finish tomorrow you know or finish today's round tomorrow	2765	B
oh right yeah	2765	B
well i i'm not really much of a golfer i have not played golf in probably fifteen years but uh it it is an intention to take up the the uh sport again	2765	B
right uh	2765	B
yeah	2765	B
right well yeah if if you're good at it i guess it's a	2765	B
not so much frustration but if you are it it you know if you're not a really good golfer it it can be real frustrating- real frustrating	2765	B
yeah	2765	B
well i it's been a while since i've been out to watch i do watch a little on TV you know when i have the chance but uh	2765	B
yeah	2765	B
well you know i wonder that too in watching some of these senior tournaments uh you know the uh the seniors skins and stuff like that on TV you see how well they're playing and you and you wonder why they're they're not able to you know to play with	2765	B
with the with the younger guys on the regular tour	2765	B
right well as i understand it and of course it's like i said it's been a while since i played but uh as i understand it as you do get older that your concentration in the putting area you know really suffers and	2765	B
that's that's the primary reason that some of these older that you know that the old players don't play as well	2765	B
but uh	2765	B
oh yeah i	2765	B
i guess come to think of it i've never heard a tennis joke	2765	B
yeah	2765	B
right	2765	B
and uh	2765	B
right	2765	B
yeah	2765	B
and perhaps- and perhaps even learn a little bit of something	2765	B
it's interesting we're talking about golf the television own in my den right now and i'm watching a ball roll up about four inches from the hole in today's Byron Nelson so	2765	B
uh-huh	2765	B
there's a awful lot of mechanics involved in	2765	B
yeah	2765	B
yeah so well what uh what course do you get to play on over in North Carolina	2765	B
oh yeah	2765	B
uh-huh	2765	B
yeah	2765	B
yeah	2765	B
yeah	2765	B
yeah but i guess in North Carolina you you're in an area where there are some really nice courses	2765	B
uh	2765	B
yeah that's	2765	B
yeah right Richardson has it's you know it's pretty close to year round there are times uh well i guess that there are times in the winter you know when you can't play but then there are times when	2765	B
you know when it thaws out and warms up and people flock to the golf course you know in December and January so	2765	B
yeah probably a week later it was warm enough you could have gone out and played and really enjoyed it even then so	2765	B
yeah i have enjoyed it too i- i really intend to play golf you know in the future my my wife and i even uh	2765	B
are going to- try to play together sometime you know	2765	B
yeah	2765	B
right	2765	B
well it's been nice talking to you okay so	2765	B
okay you too thanks	2765	B
um yes	2707	A
yeah it's um it's very hot in fact i've been cleaning because i live in an apartment so i can't do very much gardening other than balcony gardening	2707	A
um you know i have the little flower boxes with um a variety- a lot of different flowers and i do enjoy plants but i don't have a yard or anything that i can do gardening really	2707	A
uh-huh	2707	A
um-hum uh-huh	2707	A
right right	2707	A
uh-huh	2707	A
yes-	2707	A
um-hum	2707	A
uh-huh so you enjoy gardening	2707	A
uh-huh	2707	A
uh-huh	2707	A
no no i'm with a defense contractor	2707	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2707	A
um-hum	2707	A
uh-huh	2707	A
um-hum	2707	A
uh-huh	2707	A
uh-huh	2707	A
um-hum	2707	A
um yeah i'm sure it is you know different in the different areas um i'm originally from Pennsylvania and i do go home on weekends during the summer and that and uh mow my mother's grass and different things like that	2707	A
oh i would have no idea no idea whatsoever	2707	A
like i said i'm just a balcony kind of gardener with my little flowers and my flower boxes and my herbs on my window sill and	2707	A
yeah i have to start all over every year well except i do have some um	2707	A
some day lilies that um	2707	A
you know i don't do anything with and they seem to come back year after year and i leave them on my balcony even in	2707	A
in the snow and the winter you know in the ice everything because here you know not as severe as the snow is in Pennsylvania but here we still do get some snow and ice and things like that	2707	A
uh-huh	2707	A
um-hum	2707	A
um-hum	2707	A
uh-huh	2707	A
um-hum	2707	A

yeah-	2707	A
uh-huh	2707	A
um-hum	2707	A
wow uh-huh	2707	A
um-hum	2707	A
um-hum	2707	A
um-hum	2707	A
uh-huh right i'm	2707	A
um-hum	2707	A
uh-huh oh you don't sound like it	2707	A
uh-huh	2707	A
um i've been called a lot at the times though it's been not very	2707	A
appropriate i guess that i haven't been able to actually participate i've participated probably in about maybe i don't know seven calls	2707	A
and you know i've called a couple of times but most of the time i notice that um you know it takes forever to get a call through	2707	A
yeah	2707	A
um-hum um-hum	2707	A
uh-huh	2707	A
yeah it's like eighty five degrees here	2707	A
no i haven't	2707	A
uh-huh	2707	A
oh uh-huh	2707	A
um-hum	2707	A
oh my uh-huh i'll have to make sure i catch that	2707	A
um-hum	2707	A
um-hum	2707	A
uh-huh	2707	A
i'll have to make sure i catch that	2707	A
uh uh-huh	2707	A
um-hum	2707	A
uh-huh	2707	A
um right now the District Washington um in Fairfax Virginia it's fifteen miles west of Washington DC	2707	A
yeah there's there's a few not you know nearly as many as what's actually in the District but um they're definitely enjoyable right now i know the azaleas and everything are out are beautiful	2707	A
um-hum	2707	A
yeah there there there is a vast variety here of you know trees like if i look out my window right now i can see you know couple of pine trees some oak trees	2707	A
yeah	2707	A
um no actually i haven't	2707	A
um-hum	2707	A
um-hum	2707	A
uh-huh	2707	A
um-hum	2707	A
uh-huh	2707	A
um-hum	2707	A
um oh well i guess that i really don't know that much	2707	A
uh-huh	2707	A
uh-huh	2707	A
right	2707	A
uh-huh	2707	A
right uh-huh	2707	A
um-hum	2707	A
um-hum	2707	A
um-hum but then what about people that um i- i i personally work with someone that that is deaf and cannot speak she can speak but she can't	2707	A
speak very clearly and she in fact is a data entry person i mean she types away all day	2707	A
okay	2707	B
well we're official now yeah-	2707	B
oh okay	2707	B
oh yeah	2707	B
oh you're you're you're not the so-called expert- you need a house i guess to go through all of that i have had a couple of houses and uh	2707	B
uh the only recommendation i would have for someone who hasn't gardened is uh one get a couple of good books of books of course and usually they have talk shows here in Dallas they have	2707	B
two great uh talk shows that go through everything that will grow here which is the opposite probably of what would grow up where you are you know so	2707	B
uh in fact you you could easily do that now listen to turn on a talk show up there and see if there there's got to be some gardening folks on the radio that says when to put your grass in and and what kind of grass to grow up in Virginia and everything so i uh	2707	B
for someone who doesn't garden i'd say that that's my biggest recommendation is to	2707	B
oh yeah yeah i like it a lot uh	2707	B
uh it's a lot of work i'm an engineer i'm i'm with TI you are you with TI up there or okay	2707	B
okay	2707	B
um	2707	B
where was oh yeah no i- i like it i uh i always know that why i'm not a farmer when i garden though i mean it is dog work and it is tough	2707	B
i have a lot of trees down here uh	2707	B
the part i don't like i guess would be from December	2707	B
through February where you have to rake leaves	2707	B
forever it seems like and the wind blows all the leaves on from your neighbor after you rake yours so	2707	B
other than that you know those three months when it's pure dog work	2707	B
uh the rest of it's very enjoyable just going through the experiences of of putting little plants in or whatever i- i haven't had to plant any trees because i've got so many but uh	2707	B
uh but i do listen to that talk show there there is some great people from Texas A&M i don't know	2707	B
uh maybe you've heard of A&M down here but there's some great uh folks uh	2707	B
that have been well trained and again uh to	2707	B
to uh recommend gardening for this area	2707	B
yeah you probably have rye grass up there we grow bermuda and Saint Augustine here	2707	B
right yeah see you would have to learn that though see	2707	B
um	2707	B
do you have much luck in the Winter don't they they're freeze it freeze out because the roots are all in the Winter uh or do you have to start all over every year	2707	B
right yeah	2707	B
um-hum	2707	B
in the same pot that's that's amazing	2707	B
um-hum	2707	B
yeah	2707	B
i grow a few things in pots but we have to bring them in here	2707	B
in the Winter because usually	2707	B
uh if it's not below the ground so you can insulate the roots from freezing you know the pots will uh will die everything in a pot will die	2707	B
so you can bring them well we do bring stuff in the garage and everything	2707	B
but uh it's quite time consuming by the way i don't know how close you are to getting a house or anything but it's quite uh but i would definitely do it	2707	B
i'm all for doing everything whether whatever subject you pick uh do it the knowledgeable way	2707	B
don't go out there and start digging holes uh	2707	B
get some books of whether it be Pennsylvania or Virginia	2707	B
as as well as uh not your neighbors of course they usually know nothing but uh	2707	B
uh listen to still then there's always a gardening part of the newspaper for communications	2707	B
as well as i bet there's a talk show up there right now that you if you turn the dial around you'll on Saturday this is Saturday that you'll find someone probably in the morning i don't know	2707	B
discussing you know what we do up in Virginia to get something growing you probably don't have to do much over there the soil's probably so good	2707	B
our soil's not very good down here we're	2707	B
i guess in the ice age it it it's pushed a lot of uh	2707	B
limestone and everything some parts of Dallas you just can dig a foot down and you hit solid limestone you know	2707	B
so uh i think all the trees that are here now were planted kind of like the Johnny Appleseed type trees	2707	B
where people have come from i'm sure when the Indians were here there was nothing growing in this part of of Dallas it's so scrubby	2707	B
uh	2707	B
and i think that we even got our famous hundred year old uh pecan trees from Alabama and all that too	2707	B
we we call them native pecan trees but they grow wild here	2707	B
they're eating pecans though pecans are probably not taken from Virginia they're probably only in the South	2707	B
for pecan pie and all that	2707	B
it's what they call pecan pecan pie up there in in the East	2707	B
i'm from Pennsylvania and New Jersey i'm from New Jersey originally	2707	B
i've worked on that	2707	B
with some chewing gum which i shouldn't do	2707	B
um	2707	B
go ahead you what- how many times you called by the way or how many times have you been called	2707	B
um-hum	2707	B
oh yeah today that's what i'm saying today i was i got to laugh because i tried it this morning and uh i thought everybody was gardening i thought well no no this is a great subject because they're out there gardening you know	2707	B
i didn't tell you what our weather is like it is beautiful here today	2707	B
it's not quite that hot yeah we've had a real nice mild Spring uh	2707	B
you might have seen if you've seen the news today about all the tornados here that were north of us	2707	B
uh i don't know if you get CNN i don't get CNN but it's here at work in fact i'm at work today believe it or not	2707	B
but uh they have uh TV's in the break areas	2707	B
and there was some some heavy tornados uh i guess in Kansas quite a few people were killed you'll see that on the evening news	2707	B
uh	2707	B
tornados uh which is not the right subject but uh	2707	B
they blow through here all in the Spring i guess it's related somewhat to the weather you know and and the plants and all that that uh sometimes they do essentially nothing	2707	B
and the weather men yesterday were all alert say hey there's something really terrible going to happen and they they sure were right but it wasn't in Texas it was	2707	B
north of us yeah look at the news tonight they'll they'll they claim thirty odd people were killed up in Kansas City Kansas somewhere	2707	B
anyway back to planting	2707	B
uh i have never studied it is very interesting uh subject uh	2707	B
when you when did you get a house uh you your trees grow up so well up there but i'm sure you have plenty of trees	2707	B
that that is a key thing for shade	2707	B
and keeping your bills down uh	2707	B
i guess you have mostly pine trees but where in Virginia are you all	2707	B
um-hum	2707	B
oh do you have the cherry blossoms and everything there or not	2707	B
yeah	2707	B
oh yeah	2707	B
yeah azaleas grow all over we grow those here too although again we have to prepare the soil	2707	B
you probably have nice big pine you probably have all kinds of trees the oaks and everything that's one thing i noticed about	2707	B
um-hum	2707	B
have you ever been down here	2707	B
okay it's it's interesting country uh	2707	B
it is wide open uh and flat	2707	B
uh and again as i said i think the when the Indians were here there there weren't any trees but the the civilization has brought all kinds of experiments with all kinds of trees and uh	2707	B
a lot of them have done well uh they they do have some pine forest areas in west- in west- in east Texas where you have native pine trees but here in Dallas it's uh	2707	B
i think they all were planted by the classical Johnny Appleseed and uh	2707	B
uh Johnny Pecanseed whatever you would call it you know because there's a tremendous amount of pecan trees that we use for you know uh for eating	2707	B
i think they thought that was going to be a great boom crop uh	2707	B
hundred and fifty years ago because they are all over the place	2707	B
in the South	2707	B
what else	2707	B
how many- how many subject i- i the subjects are usually pretty interesting i- i'm i'm of course i'm a TI'er so i'm hoping this works TI is very good uh	2707	B
has done a lot of experiments in the speech uh synthesis synthesis can't say it	2707	B
and they've come out with some new products uh some new in fact this week they came out with some new math uh you might see them in your advertisements uh new math uh Speak and Math uh	2707	B
uh devices they they have had Speak and Spell and all that for years but they've come out with some different ones	2707	B
this past week and uh	2707	B
my wife and everyone ask me what- what are they going to accomplish out of all this and i said well you're not going to have to type on the computer one day you're just going to have to talk to it	2707	B
you know so you it's going to be much faster	2707	B
of course you know the classical thing for the handicapped too person who can't type very fast or	2707	B
like i can of course	2707	B
uh not that i can talk very fast either but uh	2707	B
yeah	2707	B
i pay a good deal of taxes i guess because i- i make a fair amount of money and uh the taxes that i pay um i guess as a as a general statement i feel i	2784	A
i guess i get my money's worth for	2784	A
i'm not sure though whether i feel	2784	A
i guess i am sure that i feel that in general though	2784	A
uh the allocation uh of the taxes in certain areas isn't- isn't correct	2784	A
well i- i lately i guess um uh or at least for the last twenty- twenty years or so i've felt that the expenditures of our taxes into high	2784	A
cost uh defense items at least in the last ten years have been uh there's been and extraordinary amount of	2784	A
money spent there and i'm not really sure that that we've gotten our money's worth there	2784	A
uh regardless of the outcome of the Desert Storm uh Desert Shield uh situations	2784	A
uh i guess my particular beef is that having participated in the military- military off and on over the over the years of being called back and things of that nature is uh i've found that you know there's an extraordinary amount of waste i take that as a	2784	A
as a given in any military operation and	2784	A
yeah and i guess- i- i should imagine that that that what the what the problem why i i'm i'm a little concerned about today is that this uh rather uh quick and	2784	A
and easy i don't know i shouldn't say easy rather quick victory in the in in the uh Mideast uh uh over the uh Iraqis uh	2784	A
might lead us into uh a false sense of security that we can do that against any other foe i'm i- i don't know what other foe that would be but	2784	A
uh i i'm just getting nervous again now hearing the voices come up that there has to be increased expenditures in that area	2784	A
yeah but it it it it would that be uh well let's see two thousand out of eleven thousand that's about a little over twenty per cent uh i- i should imagine that	2784	A
that would be to keep it at a level those levels i guess that that were originally appropriated was- was when	2784	A
the Soviet threat i guess was perceived as being	2784	A
a greater one i don't think there's very much of a threat there today	2784	A
i do worry about what nuclear weapons are left in the territories uh in their territory over there and who's controlling them but	2784	A
i- i don't know what amount of what amount of our hardware would stop some fanatic i guess from doing anything	2784	A
uh that would be irrational	2784	A
right	2784	A
yeah	2784	A
yeah	2784	A
what- what is the name of that	2784	A
yes yes	2784	A
yeah well i- i- i'm what i'm uh i guess uh it concerned about talking about the taxes in general and	2784	A
that that was an area that i- i perceive as not being the best expenditure for the amount of dollar that we're taxed for	2784	A
uh in the area of defense or perhaps we have paid too much there i don't know it just seems to me that over the years now the and and it's	2784	A
it's a cliche i- i but i see it myself i see where the infrastructure is sort of breaking down the roads the highways	2784	A
i- i- i don't know uh i know- i'm familiar with some some upbeat school areas so i don't totally agree with the the great	2784	A
uh uh with the with the great expenditure- expenditure of effort and time there but i guess overall because i guess i'm not associated with what ghetto schools and and uh	2784	A
and uh rural school systems are like i- i should imagine that would take an enormous expenditure	2784	A
um-hum	2784	A
that they don't have a broad based income tax that funds the educational system or is it all funded out of local taxes	2784	A
yeah	2784	A
sounds like the way the federal and state system works now yeah	2784	A
uh do you mean a a complete reversal	2784	A
because i guess they can't raise that money in those those poorer districts huh	2784	A
yeah	2784	A
yes i see what you're saying uh i uh i- i do i- i guess i am a strong- uh a strong and staunch supporter of some subsidy	2784	A
for any forms of education i mean by that i mean	2784	A
i'm a product myself i have uh a a a a background of uh being uh getting my college education through the GI Bill	2784	A
what but uh when i look at it to me uh it doesn't really make any difference it was a marvelous opportunity that i couldn't have done	2784	A
i don't think i would have gone on unless i had that financial	2784	A
uh easement made possible	2784	A
and i- i don't really care what it takes to qualify whether you're uh an an	2784	A
that that	2784	A
the subsidy itself or i guess the enactment of that form of legislation	2784	A
would give many people who i- i think i i think i perceive the fact at least what i read is that some younger people feel that education is priced out of their	2784	A
uh out of their uh budget i know in the state of Florida just today uh the the legislature uh adjourned and uh they had completed a fifteen per cent increase in the	2784	A
in the uh state land grant colleges which which isn't i mean to me it doesn't sound like a lot of money but i guess it would be for fifteen hundred dollars a year they went from eleven to fifteen hundred	2784	A
and uh for an out of state student the tuition went up twenty five per cent i don't know what that would be	2784	A
but that uh i guess that goes along with the general idea that the federal government had to uh was expending so much money on defense uh that	2784	A
that the program now is a uh program now is uh fees that that fund these things i guess that's trickled down to the states and the states now establish uh don't have enough money so they	2784	A
they must charge fees uh i- i i'm not too sure of that reasoning	2784	A
but i guess to get back to the main topic i don't know whether i pay too much taxes i	2784	A
i- i travel extensively in Europe and see enormous uh people pay- pay uh a great deal	2784	A
in taxes they tell me when i sit and talk to people there they tell me they	2784	A
they some states they pay uh in Germany or in	2784	A
in England in some cases people in my income level at least allege that they pay up to six fifty five percent of their gross income in taxes	2784	A
but but i'm not too sure when i put my property tax in my car tax my income tax	2784	A
and these myriad of uh now it costs me money to leave the country some sort of a tax to leave the country some sort of an airport departure tax	2784	A
uh uh a tax a sales tax which is getting to uh quite high levels i'm not sure that i'm not up fairly close to that	2784	A
you really think so	2784	A
but i mean what- what's what's happened here is is is i feel that that in the last ten years	2784	A
uh my taxes have gone up they haven't gone down i pay uh quite a bit more taxes and and and	2784	A
but that's been a Republican government for the last ten years	2784	A
well i-	2784	A
yeah	2784	A
okay uh i guess i just push something here push one again right	2784	A
just hang up	2784	A
okay Don good talking with you	2784	A
bye-bye	2784	A
okay	2784	B
well i'm sure that uh probably every person in this country would agree with you on that	2784	B
because_1 everybody has a different idea of where the money should go	2784	B
uh-huh	2784	B
yeah	2784	B
oh yeah no argument here	2784	B
yeah well of course uh a lot of uh a lot of missiles and things were expended in the course of fighting the war and the and the inventory's going to have to be restocked	2784	B
uh on now i work for TI and one of the things we were told is	2784	B
like they had eleven thousand Harm missiles which TI is the sole supplier for and they used up two thousand of them in in the war	2784	B
so they're going to have to do another contract to restock that to get ready in case something else is needed	2784	B
that that's true that's true	2784	B
well of of course now we used up twenty per cents per cent of that inventory in a matter of just a few weeks	2784	B
and uh uh uh TI also makes the missile which was the the TV laser guided bombs	2784	B
and and a big percentage of that was expended as well that that was- that was just a matter of	2784	B
uh it's called Paveway	2784	B
and uh a big percentage of that was used up during that conflict also	2784	B
so those- those are two	2784	B
areas in which TI stands to to gain some some short term business to restock that	2784	B
oh no doubt	2784	B
yeah as a matter of fact in Texas um	2784	B
we've had our school funding system declared unconstitutional	2784	B
by the a state judge	2784	B
and they and uh the legislature just passed what they called a Robin Hood Bill	2784	B
which basically what it does	2784	B
is it takes extra money from the more affluent school districts that are that are you know come from local taxes	2784	B
and send them to other parts of the state that are not so affluent	2784	B
uh well	2784	B
okay to give- to give you some perspective this this town that i had lived in for sometime	2784	B
in nineteen eighty three was funded sixty five per cent by state funds	2784	B
then we had a number of education reforms	2784	B
that the legislature said hey we got to do this we got to do this we got to do this but they forgot to put in the state budget	2784	B
the money to pay for it and they dumped it all on the local school districts	2784	B
so	2784	B
really so	2784	B
so what ended up happening was was a was a shift we went to sixty five per cent state funding to sixty five per cent local funding in a matter of four years	2784	B
and uh	2784	B
i mean	2784	B
oh complete	2784	B
complete it's all shifted to local districts	2784	B
and now even the money that's been raised for the local districts is being	2784	B
is going to be siphoned off and sent to other parts of the state	2784	B
that's right and and i have i have no problem	2784	B
with uh a certain	2784	B
uh floor level minimum level that's a standard uh that everybody uh ought to be able to have uh but i am opposed to	2784	B
any attempts to restrict um local communities from taxing themselves above that to provide above the minimum	2784	B
so did i my Master's anyway	2784	B
yeah	2784	B
that's right	2784	B
uh-huh	2784	B
uh-huh	2784	B
yeah	2784	B
yeah they had to they had to raise uh community college taxes here	2784	B
a few years ago too	2784	B
uh-huh	2784	B
yeah	2784	B
oh oh i can believe that	2784	B
yep	2784	B
yeah	2784	B
well i guarantee you you'd be paying a lot more in taxes if- if uh the Democrats had	2784	B
more say	2784	B
yeah i really do	2784	B
yeah	2784	B
every everybody is	2784	B
well what what what they've been able to do is slow down the rate of increase	2784	B
to keep it to keep it becoming- from becoming even more obnoxious	2784	B
well this has been really interesting and i've enjoyed our talk	2784	B
no you just uh we just say say good-bye and that's it	2784	B
nice talking with you too	2784	B
bye-bye	2784	B
okay	2705	B
uh i'm in southwest Houston	2705	B
uh-huh where	2705	B
yeah	2705	B
yeah i live in uh um	2705	B
well i live uh i live about five minutes from the TI plant and it's in uh a it's in the a leaf area which doesn't mean anything to you but it's in a it's in a subdivision and it's	2705	B
uh	2705	B
probably	2705	B
uh i don't know three bedroom house with uh	2705	B
you know fenced in yard and it's it's an older house it's about twenty years old i bought it about four years ago and i've been kind of fixing it up and uh doing things to it as i can	2705	B
yeah i love it i'm just it's a lot of work though i'll tell you	2705	B
keeping it up and uh i've decided that i was going to try to do my own yard this year so i've	2705	B
oh i've you know it takes me three days like come home one afternoon and mow and one day edge and another day weed eat and then my stupid magnolia tree is dropping leaves and the raking and the	2705	B
and i thought wait a minute this is and now it's ninety five degrees almost here in Houston it's horrible but anyway so how how about_1 your house	2705	B
oh my goodness uh-huh	2705	B
how many kids do you have	2705	B
three kids	2705	B
and you're a working you're a working mom too	2705	B
um-hum	2705	B
smaller house	2705	B
oh man	2705	B
i know i you know i can imagine gee	2705	B
well it it	2705	B
you tend to fill up what area you have you you don't have a whole- you know when i moved into this house i thought oh wow because i moved here from an apartment	2705	B
and apartments you can't accumulate a whole lot because you just don't have room to put it	2705	B
it's going to be great though it makes it gives you a good feeling when you've got clean out the stuff and get rid of it	2705	B
a lot of things in the garage that you know you never use you never want- you know why do i keep them there's you know it's just filling up the garage	2705	B
so you have to	2705	B
um-hum well i kept kept things that see my children are grown and	2705	B
uh some of the stuff you know was from when they were growing up so what you know you hate to throw it out but they don't want it and you know	2705	B
but i'll probably keep it keep it a while but it's it's amazing how a house	2705	B
uh i don't know how you do it with your children and although i you know	2705	B
well me i did it too but	2705	B
but oh it's it's a tough deal	2705	B
um-hum	2705	B
that's right	2705	B
that's right	2705	B
you know you have to decide is the house going to run your life or are you going to run your life yeah you just	2705	B
but it is it's it's it is a lot of a lot of work	2705	B
um-hum	2705	B
um-hum	2705	B
are you have you started looking for another house	2705	B
uh-huh	2705	B
oh	2705	B
um-hum	2705	B
well uh well are prices holding you know you be able to get what you've got in that house you think	2705	B
oh that's a real plus um-hum	2705	B
um-hum	2705	B
so maybe you can get enough to cover that	2705	B
so are you you you you're basically going to have to sell that one before you can	2705	B
or commit to something else anyway	2705	B
uh-huh	2705	B
oh really i would have thought you know at least go and start looking at least to know	2705	B
um-hum	2705	B
um-hum	2705	B
um-hum	2705	B
oh	2705	B
yeah	2705	B
yeah	2705	B
well	2705	B
well i think uh you know i think uh real estate- houses are uh it's	2705	B
it's selling much better than than it than than they did i think new homes- new homes in certain areas uh you know are are are doing very well uh and i think uh	2705	B
when i bought this house was actually it's be in May it'll be five years and uh	2705	B
this was uh a foreclosure-	2705	B
a foreclosure- foreclosure and uh so i mean it was had- had been pretty bad in this area for for awhile	2705	B
and and uh i guess over the past year it sort of i got my uh the appraisal you know the thing you get for what they're base your taxes on	2705	B
and it's gone up from it went down from what i bought it for and then and now it's come back up	2705	B
yeah well but then again i- i didn't care if it went down as long as i don't want to sell it because_1 then i have my taxes are going to be less but	2705	B
yeah but uh but you can tell by just riding around my neighborhood	2705	B
uh when i bought when i like i say when i bought this house there was oh just many many homes for sale and uh now uh	2705	B
you don't see quite as many and i and there's a lot of people like i just put a new roof on my house and repainted the outside and uh about a three or four weeks-	2705	B
okay um what area do you are you in what area of the country	2705	A
oh in Houston okay i'm up in Plano near Dallas	2705	A
do you live in a suburb or	2705	A
um-hum	2705	A
um-hum	2705	A
yeah	2705	A
uh-huh	2705	A
is it	2705	A
uh-huh	2705	A
uh-huh	2705	A
yeah	2705	A
yeah	2705	A
what fixing it up or keeping it up yeah yeah	2705	A
uh-huh	2705	A
yeah	2705	A
yep	2705	A
yep	2705	A
oh yeah yeah	2705	A
oh boy	2705	A
yeah	2705	A
so you don't want	2705	A
well we have a really large house we have three kids and we bought a five bedroom house when we moved here and um it's getting to be too much too much work to keep it up	2705	A
three three so we have a bedroom for everybody and then we have an extra playroom for them to pile all their toys in and an extra TV up there and the ironing board	2705	A
well yeah i that's the other thing is i was working uh full time i just started back about a year and a half ago	2705	A
and um my youngest one got to be three years old and so then i went back to work and i decided after a year of being a secretary that what i really wanted to do was go back and get my master's degree	2705	A
and um so then i went to part-time work and i'm going to school part-time	2705	A
and uh it's getting to be too much financially too without my full time income so we're we're just decided to put last week to put our house on the market and um get a smaller house not too small though with three kids	2705	A
so so that that was kind of a hard decision to make but i think uh i it's just been an awful lot you know financial is one thing and that's kind of concrete but also it's just	2705	A
there it the house is just really big and there there's a lot of kids and a lot of space and it all gets messed up	2705	A
so and with cleaning out to you know to sell the house we're trying to clean things out in closets and the playroom and the garage and everything	2705	A
and when you have this much space you don't have to be as careful about throwing stuff out you just put it in the garage or put it in the playroom or something	2705	A
so it's just- we just have massive stuff that you know is we just accumulated too much stuff i mean not that we have a whole bunch of things it's just little junky you know old toys	2705	A
that's it	2705	A
yeah	2705	A
right right	2705	A
um-hum	2705	A
there's no place to put it yeah	2705	A
um-hum	2705	A
yeah	2705	A
but	2705	A
right	2705	A
yeah yeah it's just because_1 you have to physically go out there and go through it i guess when you	2705	A
uh-huh	2705	A
right	2705	A
yeah	2705	A
get yeah	2705	A
it's crazy	2705	A
yeah yeah	2705	A
i think well i don't i really have uh really relaxed standards about how well organized and cleaned it is i mean it has to be basically clean because_1	2705	A
you have to be organized enough- enough to know where things are to be able to find things if it gets too messy you spend your whole life going through trying to find what you need	2705	A
so i learned that it has you have to maintain a certain standard of cleanliness but i mean organization but	2705	A
but i mean you have to decide what you're going to do you know if you going to	2705	A
what's the most important thing yeah so that's what slides for me	2705	A
right exactly	2705	A
yeah and we this house was new when we bought it and it's all white walls and so we put up some wallpaper and some drapes and you know but we just never got we didn't have the money we didn't have the time to really decorate it	2705	A
and i was- said to my husband if we had a smaller house it wouldn't take you know hundreds of dollars to decorate one room it of	2705	A
you see we did this one huge wall that we have and it was like three hundred dollars worth of wallpaper and i didn't even buy that expensive kind you know that it wouldn't even cost that much but it was it's a real long wall	2705	A
so if we had a smaller house everything would be smaller and it it wouldn't take well- it took us two weekends to put all the wallpaper up you know	2705	A
and uh	2705	A
but i have a feeling it's going to be hard	2705	A
uh	2705	A
we have we have driven around in the neighborhood we don't want our children to have to change schools we want to try and stay in the same school area so we've driven around the neighborhood and we've looked from the outside but um	2705	A
i still trying to find time to get this house this weekend we're going to finish up the garage and we're going to do you know i have a few other things i need to do here and then after that i hope	2705	A
that this house will be good enough for people to come through and look at it and then i want to start going to some open houses and	2705	A
and um you know look at some	2705	A
but i've talked a lot with our realtor about it and she assured me we could get you know a four bedroom house in the price range that we want	2705	A
but	2705	A
um yeah for this house it's just in this area of Plano it seems the the houses are moving really quickly they said my realtor said about three to six months and maybe closer to the three months because we live	2705	A
half a block from the elementary school	2705	A
so that's real nice yeah	2705	A
and it is five bedrooms she said you you it's really hard to find that and most places places have four and there are people that really want five so that's another plus so it might be closer to three months	2705	A
and you know we'll be if we're real lucky we won't lose any money you know we'll we'll be able it's mostly the closing costs that are going to	2705	A
that you- we can we'll be be uh asking for more than we bought the house for three years ago but the closing costs are going to eat out just about all of it so	2705	A
so	2705	A
before we can look too much yeah	2705	A
right that's what that's what our realtor wants to do i've talked to some other people who have put contingencies on their houses	2705	A
and um but our our realtor just doesn't really like to do that she doesn't even want me to go out and look and fall in love with something until you know i yeah	2705	A
well i'm going to i'm going to i'm going to tell her you know when i have	2705	A
and uh i'm going to go out there and look i'm going to tell her i- i want to know i want to have a feeling before i sign saying i'm going to sell this house i have to see what exactly it is that we're going to be moving into	2705	A
so but i trust her pretty much in that	2705	A
you know she knows what we're looking for and she knows what's out there so	2705	A
so how about_1 in Houston how is it down there	2705	A
is it getting better	2705	A
um-hum	2705	A
um-hum	2705	A
um-hum	2705	A
oh yeah	2705	A
um-hum	2705	A
right	2705	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2705	A
oh	2705	A
come back up oh good yeah	2705	A
right	2705	A
that's true i didn't think about that that's right	2705	A
um-hum	2705	A
um-hum	2705	A
uh-huh	2705	A
uh-huh	2705	A
hello okay	2799	B
um	2799	B
do you work at TI	2799	B
yeah	2799	B
what company are you are you working at all	2799	B
oh okay	2799	B
yeah	2799	B
uh-huh	2799	B
what	2799	B
oh yeah don't ever think of those as a benefit but they sure are	2799	B
yeah what is their sick leave policy	2799	B
is it paid	2799	B
uh do you get penalized for taking it off	2799	B
the reason why i said is um TI uh the hourly employees	2799	B
um they have i'm not sure up to five years they have a certain number of days and after five years they have um unlimited uh personal time off but	2799	B
if they miss more than say ten point five hours in a three month period they get penalized for it so really they don't ever huh	2799	B
huh-uh	2799	B
the problem is with that is that we work eleven or we work twelve hour days so no one could even take off a day for pay you know PTO um because they get penalized for it	2799	B
and they lose their certification pay which is like fifty five cents an hour for three whole months so it's really not a very good benefit	2799	B
yeah	2799	B
yeah that's the biggest thing and people come to work sick but when their kids get sick it's like well i can't afford to take off but i have to	2799	B
uh-huh	2799	B
that's true it is it's not really uh consistent	2799	B
yeah i really wish that somebody in- in big companies or any company would take a hint from like that movie Nine to Five did you see that where they had the child care right there on the	2799	B
that was so good and that would help the morale of parents i think so much	2799	B
because_1 i hate to see that i mean probably ninety percent of the people that work for me are single parents and they have to you know use child care at least for a couple hours a day	2799	B
so i don't know i- i really think a big company needs to take responsibility for that	2799	B
yeah	2799	B
um-hum	2799	B
yeah	2799	B
yeah that's good	2799	B
i know it's real i don't have kids yet but it's tough	2799	B
um	2799	B
what kind of uh	2799	B
how many vacation days do you get a year	2799	B
that's great for how many years you been have you worked there	2799	B
oh wow that's great	2799	B
um-hum	2799	B
huh	2799	B
yeah	2799	B
TI isn't doing very well so like i'm i'm negative vacation because i've only worked there three years and i- i get five days every six months well	2799	B
every about two three months we shut down for a week because you know there's no demand for our product so	2799	B
yeah and so we've shut down six weeks a year whereas we used to only shut down two	2799	B
and so it's kind of hurt	2799	B
yeah	2799	B
and luckily my boss has maybe you know allowed me to work it off but a lot of people you know go in the hole and uh take you know weeks without pay and it's tough	2799	B
um i don't ever but the people that work for me do yeah	2799	B
i mainly the reason because i'm salary so i don't ever lose pay i mean i just go in debt for vacation so yeah	2799	B
um yeah mainly because i haven't had really had to use it much i mean	2799	B
yeah i have to pay for my husband which is kind of expensive for him i mean it's like	2799	B
sort- sort of yeah um the reason why i don't know much is because i don't real uh i haven't really had to use like my medical i know they increased the deductible last year which kind of hurt	2799	B
and i don't know and after that they pay like eighty percent and the dentals the dental covers quite a bit but like i said i've never really been sick or anything so i've never had to use it	2799	B
um	2799	B
is that like match savings	2799	B
yeah it's fifty percent matched	2799	B
some companies i know are a hundred percent matched yeah like Harris Semiconductors in Florida	2799	B
huh	2799	B
really	2799	B
ours is only up to four percent though	2799	B
yeah	2799	B
because_1 i mean i only put in like a real small amount because_1 it's four percent you know after- after- after that you put it in and you get like interest- interest i mean i've saved quite a bit it's helped me a lot but	2799	B
you have to roll it over to an IRA if you ever quit	2799	B
but you know that's still a good deal	2799	B
uh	2799	B
yeah it teaches people to think of the future i think	2799	B
really	2799	B
ooh	2799	B
wow	2799	B
that's kind of a rip	2799	B
huh	2799	B
TI didn't even give raises this year so	2799	B
no they gave uh a few bonuses but for the most part no nobody in TI got raises	2799	B
yeah	2799	B
yeah	2799	B
really	2799	B
um	2799	B
yeah okay	2799	A
no i don't do you	2799	A
oh okay	2799	A
yeah i work for NCNB	2799	A
and let's see the question was what benefits you consider most important i think uh definitely medical and dental insurance	2799	A
um life insurance long-term disability uh vacation	2799	A
vacation	2799	A
yeah and um	2799	A
i think what i don't like some of the policies that our company has that i don't like i don't like their sick leave policy their short-term disability policy and i would like to see them do something about um child care	2799	A
oh it's only like i don't know like six days a year which is way below the national average	2799	A
yeah	2799	A
no	2799	A
um-hum	2799	A
that's not even two days that's not even two days and what if you get the flu and you're sick for a week or two	2799	A
oh no	2799	A
yeah	2799	A
wow	2799	A
no that's in fact i wouldn't call that much of a benefit at all	2799	A
i think you know people get sick and if you get sick usually you're sick for more than a day and then you know if your children get sick	2799	A
uh you know parents have to take time off for that and um	2799	A
yeah	2799	A
and i think you know it varies from manager to manager some managers keep track of it and some managers don't and it's really unfair you know	2799	A
but i think you know at NCNB in any any work place being a single parent i think that child care is my greatest expense and um	2799	A
you know it's it's getting to the point where you just can't afford it anymore	2799	A
um-hum	2799	A
right there yes	2799	A
yes very much very much	2799	A
um-hum	2799	A
and i think they should even do something for when children are sick you know provide facilities for sick children	2799	A
although i know that's not very comfortable for the children when they're sick they probably just would rather stay home but um	2799	A
you know my options are you know to either call in sick to take to take him to one of those places that takes care of sick children um	2799	A
you know and that's about it you know a lot of times i don't have the option of staying home without- you know i just can't you know there's something going on that day or you know that i have to be there for	2799	A
and i know a lot of um what i do like though is i see a lot of men taking off and they take turns with their wives	2799	A
you know staying home with the kids but that's still you know kids are sick a lot	2799	A
and uh	2799	A
well i get three weeks	2799	A
yeah-	2799	A
i got that when i started because i was because i'm an officer of the company	2799	A
so it depends on if you're an if you're not an officer it depends on how long you've been there i think you get like a week your first year and then two weeks and then you have to be there like five years to get three weeks or four years	2799	A
and then officers just start out at three weeks and then they go up to four weeks	2799	A
depending on i'm real happy with the vacation i guess you know you could take vacation days if you had to stay home but	2799	A
um-hum	2799	A
um-hum	2799	A
oh yeah	2799	A
i've heard of companies that do that	2799	A
ooh	2799	A
yeah and you have to use your vacation pay for that	2799	A
oh can you collect unemployment	2799	A
do they	2799	A
yeah	2799	A
well that's yeah that's not not very good are you satisfied with your insurance	2799	A
does your company pay for it or do you pay for it	2799	A
do you have flexible benefits where you can get sort of like pick and choose	2799	A
um-hum	2799	A
well i think our our insurance we have to pay for part of it and the company pays for part of it but	2799	A
it's expensive but i don't think it's out of line with what other company you know with what other companies do it's just that in general it's it's expensive	2799	A
and i you know i don't i don't like it do you have uh um four O one K	2799	A
yeah	2799	A
well that's good	2799	A
how	2799	A
really	2799	A
for a new job	2799	A
ours will only match twenty five yeah for up to ten percent of your salary	2799	A
oh okay well then i guess that's makes a difference	2799	A
yeah	2799	A
well that's good	2799	A
yeah	2799	A
yeah i'm glad that we that we have that um the company that i worked for before NCNB was just they were just starting it and uh i think that's i think that's great	2799	A
well yeah because retirement plans now are so bad i don't know about your company but our company tries to keep base salaries low and they compensate employees more with bonuses	2799	A
and incentive pay rather than raises because it cuts down on their expenses for the pension plan because your pension's going to be based on what your salary was	2799	A
not what your salary plus bonuses where and your your bonuses cut ultimately end up being fifty percent of your salary	2799	A
so	2799	A
yeah	2799	A
but more and more companies are going to that now	2799	A
at all	2799	A
really	2799	A
gosh that's pretty bad especially with you know inflation and i i've noticed that the cost of living i've lived in Dallas now for three years and the cost of living has just gone up incredibly in that three years that i've been here	2799	A
yeah your housing housing mostly i guess is where i notice it	2799	A
but you know in in you know kids kid's get more expensive as they	2799	A
well i'm having a hard time remembering the last movie i saw	2712	A
yeah i guess uh i can remember seeing Dances With Wolves that was uh well that's uh that's an excellent film i- i highly i highly recommend that in fact i guess they're bringing that back out	2712	A
and uh they're adding fifty minutes to it or something like that	2712	A
that's right	2712	A
so it's going to be almost four hours before it's over	2712	A
or beyond yeah beyond that uh	2712	A
oh i wouldn't say that no because_1 i my wife- my my wife and i went and i think she enjoyed it even more than i did	2712	A
so uh unlike Field of Dreams i guess the last Kevin Costner movie we'd seen before that was Field of Dreams i- i guess i'd have to admit that probably was more of a guy's movie than a	2712	A
than a than a lady's movie	2712	A
but uh	2712	A
oh okay yeah we saw that on video that's that's that's another thing i guess that uh it's kind of	2712	A
kind of curbed uh us going out so much is that uh there was so many movies i didn't see when they came out beforehand that uh i know are coming out on video that you	2712	A
you look in the paper and you and you go well i can either see this or i can see this movie that i really wanted to see three years ago and didn't see	2712	A
i haven't and and i	2712	A
i- i hear it's excellent and it's probably something i'd i'd enjoy but i- i heard that it was so uh kind of gruesome in scenes that that and that was the part i probably wouldn't like but i heard that uh the acting was was great and it was a really thrilling movie	2712	A
and that in fact i read something in the paper here the other day that uh Anthony Hopkins i guess the guy who plays the the psycho or the villain that	2712	A
that uh he's getting letters from just all over you know the world and all that and and he suddenly become uh like a real screen idol or a uh	2712	A
like a a leading man you know he thinks it's funny but i guess uh woman in particular think it's such a scary movie and that uh that	2712	A
that they just identify with not identify with him but they they like his character- i- i wouldn't say like like his character but they're so fascinated by his character that uh they write him letters and and say how much they liked him and things like that	2712	A
that's probably- that's probably a good idea unfortunately i think i i don't really enjoy movies with a whole lot of blood in them_1 so uh	2712	A
yeah yeah i'll i'll go see a drama like uh when the Untouchables came out which is another Kevin Costner movie well this is going to be a rut isn't it	2712	A
i just so happen i guess we just see those but my wife actually talked me into going to see that and i didn't really want to go see it and it was you know it was kind of a a bloody movie but uh it was done in such a way that you know	2712	A
and with gangsters and guns and all that i mean you are not going to avoid that so wasn't as	2712	A
it wasn't like they spent you know long shots relishing every drop or something like that	2712	A
yeah	2712	A
yeah we	2712	A
we we did in fact i think that is the last movie that we saw was Scenes from Mall and	2712	A
yeah so did we we thought it was really lousy and it	2712	A
and	2712	A
yeah	2712	A
he he's not forty anymore that's for sure	2712	A
plus uh	2712	A
plus there's something about seeing those two walking through a mall just like and nobody paying attention is just like no no and especially with him carrying a yellow surfboard that was just like	2712	A
this this is real realistic and you know if i saw Woody Allen and Bette Midler go by and he's still carrying a yellow surfboard i wouldn't notice him i wouldn't even see him	2712	A
and	2712	A
oh yeah it was just a	2712	A
it was just a	2712	A
yeah and i- i just can't believe uh that you could use up two hours watching two people go from store to store in a mall	2712	A
you know just uh in fact that was the funny part of it was sitting there and just seeing mall shots going you know i could go to North Park or i could go to Collin Creek or something like that and see that so	2712	A
so uh it was just not really fun at all	2712	A
um-hum	2712	A
or money	2712	A
and we went to an early show on that one so we didn't uh	2712	A
yeah	2712	A
oh gee yeah tell the truth but that	2712	A
yeah	2712	A
yeah	2712	A
yeah i didn't get to see that i didn't get to see that but uh but	2712	A
i didn't see that either that was something we'll probably rent a video on one of these days but uh	2712	A
oh Kiss Before Dying or something like that i've just seen advertised but i guess i haven't kept up on the movies that are out right just coming out right now	2712	A
um-hum um-hum that uh sounds sounds like you are pretty much split between romantic comedies and thrillers then	2712	A
yeah yeah	2712	A
i guess i guess the only real movie that we we wanted to go see and haven't gone to see yet is is Class Action II with Gene Hackman	2712	A
because uh he's usually i hear he's good in it but that's i guess he's good in almost everything he does so	2712	A
and uh so we're we're looking for one of these days to to see that	2712	A
i didn't see that no	2712	A
that good i think that's what everyone said that it was a pretty lousy movie	2712	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2712	A
yeah yeah boy she hasn't been in a movie- well maybe that's why she hasn't been in a movie in a long time	2712	A
yeah i- i guess i guess i don't tend to even though it seems like we've been to a lot of Kevin Costner's movies maybe that's my wife's uh input more than i but uh but i guess i don't rely on anymore on	2712	A
star value i don't really go see movies because_1 it's like Robert Redford was in Havana and and boy that looked like a bad movie just in the coming attractions and i said and i said boy	2712	A
i haven't seen that i haven't was that good	2712	A
and that i heard that uh and i don't particularly like Richard Gere i guess the only movie that i that i liked that he was in was Officer and a Gentleman and even then you know that was kind of pushing it	2712	A
but uh but i heard every even if you didn't like Richard Gere you probably would've liked that movie	2712	A
uh okay	2712	A
okay okay	2712	A
um-hum um-hum	2712	A
i haven't seen that no no we didn't go see that	2712	A
i heard that was more of a kid's movie and uh	2712	A
yeah when you when he was actually in the funny paper and	2712	A
yeah that's true	2712	A
that probably-	2712	A
yeah i- i probably couldn't get my wife to go see that i think the last time i got to see her something like that was Batman it took me a it took me a	2712	A
well that's true i think that was the feel that they they were after was everything was really dark and and and kind of foreboding and	2712	A
yeah	2712	A
uh-huh	2712	A
that that might have been something because i think that i don't think that's movie that would have been as good on a on a small screen	2712	A
i mean you really it really had to be on a big screen i think especially for Jack Nicholson to come across because because_1 i mean what he did was so corny	2712	A
you know like it it's like they they spent a half hour setting up that line about bats in the belfry you know it's where Batman is climbing up to save what's her name and	2712	A
and he's up there and it's like all these things are are falling on him and it's like they they work all this time just when he gets to the top that the Joker can say something about well looks like we got bats in the belfry and it's like	2712	A
well i think they've been pushing to try to get this joke in for a long time yeah i hear a i hear a second Batman movie is getting ready to come out too yeah i guess Danny De Vito's in it	2712	A
i guess he's	2712	A
yeah i no	2712	A
i- i liked it till about a half hour from the from the end it looked it looked like it was going to be a funny movie and and until about until it got to be almost too much	2712	A
you know when they were	2712	A
really	2712	A
yeah	2712	A
it	2712	A
i again i think the first hour was really everyone was laughing and and my wife and i were really enjoying it	2712	A
and then i think it was when he finally drove the car over the yard or something like that and she finally trying uh i mean it gets from from little things like throwing things at him and dropping things on him to to where she's actually	2712	A
trying to kill him and then i almost got real furious and and it was like a whole mood change right here and that whole chandelier scene at the end it was like	2712	A
yeah	2712	A
and and and it was funny because we usually like Michael uh Douglas and and Kathleen Turner i think we've we've liked everything like uh	2712	A
like Diane saw Jagged Edge you know my wife	2712	A
and and i and i didn't but i guess you know she i mean she she's seen a lot more Kathleen Turner movies than i have and she the only ones i ever saw were Romancing the Stone and and and those kind of movies but she likes them_1 and	2712	A
and uh she i was really disappointed- i think we we were both disappointed in fact for some reason although it looked like it was going to be funny	2712	A
um-hum	2712	A
um-hum	2712	A
well i was too i- i thought i saw a lot of movies but i guess i- i haven't seen any really recently	2712	B
well i haven't seen that	2712	B
that's what everybody says	2712	B
oh are they	2712	B
see that's why i don't want to go see it because_1 it's three hours just to start of it i can't	2712	B
i can't sit through a movie that long	2712	B
i know i don't think i'll see it	2712	B
well i hear it's a man's movie anyway	2712	B
really	2712	B
oh really	2712	B
oh was it yeah	2712	B
well it's kind of like you know Steel Magnolia is to me was a woman's movie	2712	B
yeah uh i was trying to think of the last movie i saw oh i saw i saw Ghost that was good	2712	B
oh did you	2712	B
yeah going out	2712	B
yeah	2712	B
right	2712	B
i want to see Silence of the Lambs have you seen that	2712	B
i hear it's excellent	2712	B
yeah yeah	2712	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2712	B
uh-huh	2712	B
right	2712	B
oh really	2712	B
uh-huh	2712	B
oh yeah	2712	B
yeah that's what it is	2712	B
um-hum	2712	B
well this guy at work told me not to go see it by myself at night or see it by myself at night so i	2712	B
i don't either i myself i like romantic comedies myself but uh	2712	B
yeah	2712	B
my gosh you're you must be a big fan of his	2712	B
uh-huh	2712	B
yeah	2712	B
i	2712	B
yeah	2712	B
i guess the last movie i saw was at Scenes From the Mall with Woody Allen and Bette Midler and i- i guess you just have to be a big Woody Allen fan which i'm not i think you either hate him or like him	2712	B
and i thought i thought it was terrible	2712	B
yeah i- i like her but i really don't like him for some reason in the first place trying to pass him off at age forty just almost was too much more than i could handle you know	2712	B
Lord no he hasn't seen forty in ten years has he	2712	B
yes	2712	B
huh-uh	2712	B
isn't that the truth	2712	B
i believe i would too but and then the money they spent on that food that shrimp or or that sushi or something like hundred i mean eleven hundred dollars or something ended up spending nobody spends that kind of money i don't think	2712	B
huh-uh	2712	B
no	2712	B
right	2712	B
right that was a terrible	2712	B
no i came i had asked my neighbor to go with me and she decided to she had to fly so i thought i'll go see it by myself	2712	B
and i'm glad i didn't ask her to waste her time now because	2712	B
yeah i didn't i mean that was a horrible movie i	2712	B
in fact i think i went to one of the early shows i didn't have to spend a bunch of money on it i think i got in for two seventy five or something i would have hated to have spent seven dollars on that	2712	B
but she usually plays some pretty cute movies like that one with Nick Nolte that was Beverly Down and Out in Beverly Hills wasn't she in that	2712	B
she was cute in that and uh i think i hear she was good in Beaches i didn't see that	2712	B
i want to see that movie uh A Kiss Before	2712	B
you die before yeah something like that	2712	B
i know i just see it advertise on TV and it really looks like it is going to be a	2712	B
thriller a good thriller	2712	B
yeah yeah i am i really don't like to see thrillers by myself but uh i will go see them_1 i	2712	B
yeah i want to see that that's another good one	2712	B
yeah	2712	B
yeah i know it i've never seen him in anything bad yet	2712	B
and another person i used to i really did like was Barbara Streisand and then i saw her in that movie Nuts and that was a wasted- don't waste your even at a dollar movie that one would have been bad oh	2712	B
oh it was horrible and i really did like her until that	2712	B
but gosh not any more ooh	2712	B
uh-huh	2712	B
yeah	2712	B
yeah	2712	B
i know it how about did you see uh Pretty Woman with Richard Gere and	2712	B
oh that's good yeah i liked that that was a good movie	2712	B
yeah	2712	B
oh i'm a fan of his	2712	B
yeah he is good i really- i really did like him i'm a fan of his	2712	B
yeah he's uh he's okay in my book	2712	B
and of course Julia Roberts is cute too but i- i didn't really know i hadn't heard of her too much until i saw this movie and uh	2712	B
then i saw Dick Tracy did you see that	2712	B
nah it was	2712	B
well	2712	B
the kids wouldn't appreciate it because_1 they they've never heard of Dick Tracy other than you know like i've heard of him all my life but	2712	B
yeah but they don't know him except for uh probably uh the movie you know so i don't think they would appreciate it as much as as older people would because they you know grew up with him but i was kind of disappointed in it a little bit uh	2712	B
yeah and i didn't like that you know why i didn't like that movie it was so dark i couldn't see	2712	B
i guess	2712	B
and i don't like to have to strain my eyes and try to see the characters on the screen that that was one i- i watched on a video at home and i maybe that was it maybe	2712	B
no	2712	B
yeah yeah	2712	B
uh-huh	2712	B
uh-huh	2712	B
uh-huh yeah	2712	B
oh is it	2712	B
oh now that would be good i like him oh did you see uh War of the Roses	2712	B
i loved it but most people that i knew didn't like it but i thought i was funny	2712	B
uh-huh	2712	B
oh well now that was the first movie i or the first movie in ages that i have seen twice i went back to see it and when i saw it the second time it wasn't as cute but it was i just roared through it the first time and that's why i probably-	2712	B
um-hum	2712	B
yeah	2712	B
trying to kill him	2712	B
yeah i know it	2712	B
oh i know it and i was so shocked at the ending i didn't think they would die	2712	B
i really didn't i was so shocked	2712	B
Douglas yeah he plays	2712	B
i have too	2712	B
uh-huh oh yes that was good oh that was good	2712	B
oh you didn't	2712	B
that's a good one	2712	B
uh-huh	2712	B
oh okay	2712	B
she's a good actress	2712	B
oh	2712	B
yeah well i did i don't know maybe i got a warped sense of humor because_1 i like i said i just roared through it the first time and then the second time when i saw it but it see it was a month later that i saw it the second time maybe if i had waited longer and seen it a second time	2712	B
okay what kind of do you have children	2788	A
oh okay	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
oh	2788	A
uh-huh	2788	A
and you had trouble finding somewhere for him to be before he was five	2788	A
right	2788	A
that	2788	A
uh-huh	2788	A
to learn something and that's i mean that's even not only toddlers but you know even your older children	2788	A
it's hard to find anywhere there really going to learn something and then yeah you do have to pay you know if you the better the place the more you're going to pay	2788	A
true very true if	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
um-hum if i had any children i would uh i hope that i'll be in a position to stay home with my child because	2788	A
i'm not real uh	2788	A
uh trusting of a lot of people	2788	A
uh especially today people i work in the news business and i just see different things all the time	2788	A
and people are just crazy these days they're crazy	2788	A
and and i don't you know it takes me a takes me a long time to just trust someone as a friend much less to you know trust someone with my with my child	2788	A
uh-huh	2788	A
uh-huh	2788	A
uh-huh	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
hum	2788	A
i guess that's the best way you know to get recommendations from your friends or family members	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
hum	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
yeah yeah i mean you have to be you have to be sure that these people	2788	A
i mean not that they're going to abuse your child or anything but you just have to be sure that they're going to be watching them you know that they wouldn't let them drink something or	2788	A
you know eat something off the floor you know just simple things that can be harmful	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
and you hear so much you know on the news about	2788	A
uh child care places and also um senior care facilities you know and you hear abuse yeah	2788	A
and so you just you just don't know and you almost want to you know spend a couple of weeks with in class with your child just to see how it is or something	2788	A
but	2788	A
no i don't	2788	A
huh-uh	2788	A
no	2788	A
i'm	2788	A
uh no i'm only i'm twenty three	2788	A
so i still have a little bit of time	2788	A
um it's just not in the cards for me right now i'm trying to get my career going	2788	A
and uh	2788	A
yeah	2788	A
yeah	2788	A
um-hum um-hum	2788	A
uh-huh	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
and you brought up a good point you know about learning you just don't want a babysitter you you would hope that maybe they'd come home and know some of their ABC's or something you know get them	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
huh	2788	A
yes	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
right	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
right	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
did you take this same uh route with your other two children	2788	A
okay	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
i was wondering how	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
right	2788	A
and it helps that he has older brothers um you know just to have role models and things like that	2788	A
um-hum um-hum	2788	A
hum	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
that's excellent	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
well what kid isn't	2788	A
these days so	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
do they have any kind of program like at TI or wherever your wife works	2788	A
um some any kind of day care	2788	A
hum because_1 i know they're they're putting that into a lot of uh corporations now	2788	A
right	2788	A
so maybe that'll be an option for	2788	A
but then i- i foresee that being just a babysitting	2788	A
thing not much learning but	2788	A
you know	2788	A
kind of somebody to just watch your kid while your at work	2788	A
hum	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
right	2788	A
um	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
hum	2788	A
do you think it would have been better for him to have um	2788	A
maybe one continuous teacher somebody to that he could	2788	A
uh get attached to or is it better the other way with a lot of different	2788	A
uh-huh	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
right	2788	A
hum	2788	A
right um um-hum	2788	A
right	2788	A
yeah each child is individual as for as learning and things	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
right well it sounds good sounds like he's doing real well	2788	A
um-hum well good	2788	A
um-hum um-hum	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
and they'll probably sit him in front of the television	2788	A
you know while they do other things yeah	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
yeah	2788	A
well that's good that's good	2788	A
uh-huh	2788	A
uh-huh	2788	A
that's great	2788	A
right right	2788	A
that's probably what i'll try and look for whenever i do have my children i don't know when that will be but um	2788	A
you know just really look into it will it will take me a long time to find somewhere i'm sure	2788	A
just because i- i just want to be i want to be so positive that you know my children are okay	2788	A
as well as the other children in the center you know	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
exactly	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
it's difficulties but it's it's a lot more difficulties these days because you have both parents working a lot of times and so you have to find day care whereas you know here	2788	A
um-hum um-hum	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
that's right	2788	A
so child care's a necessity whereas years ago you know the husband basically worked and the wife basically stayed home	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
right	2788	A
i think that has a lot to do with just just all children how they learn and things just because the basic family is is breaking	2788	A
you know the basic family is not there anymore	2788	A
um-hum	2788	A
i think that plays a big part in in a child's learning and you know what they can and cannot do in child care	2788	A
i would think	2788	A
okay	2788	B
yeah we have one that's seventeen one that's fifteen and one that's just now six	2788	B
and we had kind of a hard time finding someplace that would	2788	B
we could put Michael's because_1 his birthday is the first of September and he was going to school at five	2788	B
so he started the first grade when he was five or started	2788	B
yeah first grade when he was five years old	2788	B
yeah so we could you know we tried to find him someplace where he could learn something	2788	B
and it was	2788	B
uh	2788	B
mediocore- mediocre expensive it wasn't really that expensive but it's really hard to find someplace where you can send your child and expect him to learn something	2788	B
yeah	2788	B
yeah well	2788	B
yeah but parents pay when they stay home with them anyway	2788	B
you know my-	2788	B
my wife works so	2788	B
it costs us more for her to stay home more than it does for him to go to the babysitter so	2788	B
okay	2788	B
yeah see i don't know	2788	B
yeah	2788	B
and	2788	B
yeah	2788	B
well see we took our time and we checked it out and we found a preschool for him	2788	B
and it you know through other	2788	B
folks where i where i work i work at TI	2788	B
so through other folks where we worked we	2788	B
found a nice preschool it was actually at a licensed preschool you know we	2788	B
had those requirements	2788	B
so	2788	B
yeah	2788	B
you know i well that and	2788	B
you know i don't think i would have left him anywhere that would i would have stayed home with him first	2788	B
before i left him somewhere that you know they still have unlicensed babysitters running around up here and	2788	B
you know i just i- i don't think i'd take that chance	2788	B
you know i think it's out of sight or out of mind for less than	2788	B
for more than a minute or so	2788	B
but you never know	2788	B
yeah	2788	B
yeah	2788	B
but you you know	2788	B
as far as brittle as child abuse is these days you never know	2788	B
you don't know who you can trust and who you can't	2788	B
you know	2788	B
yeah senior care is getting real bad	2788	B
yeah	2788	B
so you have no children at all huh	2788	B
gee	2788	B
do you miss that part in your life or	2788	B
yeah	2788	B
yeah yeah	2788	B
i imagine yeah working in the news production anyway back to the subject	2788	B
we should have discussed this earlier but anyway it's tough it really is it's hard to find	2788	B
good child care and it's hard to find someplace where you can leave your child and trust that he's going to be fine all day long	2788	B
and	2788	B
yeah you know and he's he's doing real well it it it has paid off for him he's in first grade now and he's you know got a second grade reading level and a fourth grade math level	2788	B
so you know those early ages when he would you know when his mom and dad are at work and he's actually in child care in a preschool not	2788	B
just child care you know we could have sent him to anybody you know there's a lot people at work that would have babysat him but	2788	B
sending him to a preschool where he actually learns something has paid off not only for us his his attitude is i think a little bit	2788	B
tall for a six year old and	2788	B
you know but his	2788	B
um they they were outside my marriage so	2788	B
i don't know	2788	B
i would say no but	2788	B
you know all my children excel they're they're really good and i guess no he learns from the older boys too but	2788	B
yeah yeah	2788	B
yeah seeing like uh in one way we're kind of lucky because_1 they're all boys but in another way we're not so lucky because_1 we don't have	2788	B
another woman in the house for my wife to share but	2788	B
so we faced that too but	2788	B
he learns quite a bit he learned quite a bit from	2788	B
not only from nursery school but he learned quite a bit from the older boys and	2788	B
you know he's excelled and it's paying off for him it really is he's	2788	B
but	2788	B
i think it's important i think it's really nice to know that you can	2788	B
find someplace i don't know you know how it is down there in Waco but in Lubbock we have a few that you can	2788	B
send your children to and they can actually learn something instead of just being babysat	2788	B
and	2788	B
no not any	2788	B
huh-uh	2788	B
we just	2788	B
yeah they're trying to the federal government is trying to insist on that too so	2788	B
no we don't yet	2788	B
well it would be nice	2788	B
you know there	2788	B
yeah there's not well	2788	B
you know where where we sent Michael the first few years was there was different teachers all the time you know some	2788	B
girls were there in the morning and then some substitute teachers in the afternoon and they actually taught him something instead of just watching him all day	2788	B
you know and then he they had a group of kids and they put on skits and they put on plays and they did the Halloween thing and the Valentine's Day things	2788	B
and it's you know it was important to us so we you know we took a good look at it and made sure it was going to go that way	2788	B
um	2788	B
no because i think	2788	B
you know as a child growing up i think is a task that belongs to his parents	2788	B
i don't think he needed to be attached to too even though he did	2788	B
you know he attached himself to a couple of those but	2788	B
i think his attachments at home and you know he gets the idea of what school is for and uh you know i have different teachers here and this person can teach me one thing and this person teach teach me another and	2788	B
no so i- i- i really can't say that it would be it's important for him to attach himself to anybody	2788	B
he did well you it it with another child i can't say that	2788	B
because_1 i don't have that experience	2788	B
yeah see	2788	B
but i don't have that experience so i can't say that you know he did well so	2788	B
i don't think we made too many mistakes	2788	B
we tried hard	2788	B
yeah he's doing real well	2788	B
and he learned from it so and that was the most important thing that we wanted was for him to learn not just to sit there and be babysat all day	2788	B
you know babysat sounds to me like	2788	B
well you're here i guess i'll watch you when i get time you know maybe i'll clean my house maybe i'll cook you lunch maybe i won't	2788	B
you know and	2788	B
yeah yeah	2788	B
yeah and i don't you know i don't allow that when he's at home so	2788	B
but	2788	B
we had a good experience and we really did well	2788	B
so and he didn't	2788	B
he served	2788	B
better than we did you know he gained he actually gained from it you know sure we gained from it because we were allowed to continue our employment and	2788	B
continue our family but i think in the long run he gained from it just	2788	B
being somewhere where we learned something instead of just sitting around watching TV and playing all day	2788	B
and its important	2788	B
yeah	2788	B
yeah	2788	B
yeah well	2788	B
yeah	2788	B
well you know his- his mom didn't go back to work till	2788	B
you know he was six months old	2788	B
and we just didn't want to dump him somewhere and make him feel like he wasn't wanted	2788	B
and we wanted his center of attention at home but	2788	B
we did what we could and it it worked out real well i'm glad we were so careful	2788	B
oh yeah you know	2788	B
well it	2788	B
most of the time now it's a necessity you can't afford	2788	B
so	2788	B
you know i'm not making seventy or thirty- eighty thousand dollars a year so	2788	B
it's pretty tough	2788	B
yeah and mom mom was allowed to stay home and there was	2788	B
a few families outside of that where dad stayed home and mom worked but not very many that i know of when i was growing up	2788	B
and you know i'm forty now but	2788	B
i know when i was a kid mom was always at home	2788	B
so we didn't	2788	B
yeah it is yeah it is i'll agree with that it is it's it's not there	2788	B
you know	2788	B
yeah	2788	B
anyway so what have what have you been into did you watch LA Law last night	2701	A
uh-huh	2701	A
uh-huh	2701	A
yeah	2701	A
they they they get first crack huh	2701	A
well i usually i guess a lot of the sitcoms	2701	A
Cosby Cheers uh	2701	A
uh	2701	A
uh-huh	2701	A
yeah A different- A Different World	2701	A
a Different World	2701	A
what else do i get into um	2701	A
but some of the other ones like i've been getting into L A Law and	2701	A
uh	2701	A
no i don't make a point i i guess i really never make a point to to watch anything i'll just end up catching it but uh	2701	A
yeah you know if i'm not doing anything that night uh	2701	A
you know which i guess is usually most nights no	2701	A
but uh	2701	A
oh speaking of 20/20 you didn't see the one in with the exorcists- exorcists	2701	A
uh	2701	A
uh-huh	2701	A
yeah i did	2701	A
oh well the girl that supposedly was possessed uh had actually uh you know seen uh you know something- uh some medical the medical side i don't know if it was a psychologist or what all but	2701	A
um	2701	A
you know it was interesting- interesting- it's interesting uh and uh	2701	A
you know i'm from you know i'm was raised Catholic fairly you know fairly- fairly strong with my mom and dad so	2701	A
but it you know that's kind of interesting um but the bottom line it you know they did the exorcism it wasn't real major you know she- she was fairly you know she- you know obviously there she you know she something was wrong with her	2701	A
but uh it wasn't really uh	2701	A
you know extraordinary as far as her actions	2701	A
and she had done that and she felt like that helped her	2701	A
but at the same time shortly after that exorcism they also started um	2701	A
uh giving her medication for like a split personality type stuff- of	2701	A
so uh she's doing better but and and the girl herself you know believes that it you know that she was uh	2701	A
you know possessed but and you know it it's hard to say	2701	A
yeah i'm not i'm not sure you know who knows but uh anyway it wasn't uh	2701	A
you know it was uh	2701	A
it was you know	2701	A
well i i can't say it wasn't just because of the fact that that it's pretty	2701	A
unusual for something like that to be nationally televised uh or or have anybody come in you know who who would want to have that televised you know if that was happening to your daughter	2701	A
and her parents are right there you know doing it all you know so	2701	A
um	2701	A
uh-huh	2701	A
yeah	2701	A
i'm in Phoenix Arizona right now	2701	A
are you in Dallas	2701	A
oh okay	2701	A
yeah	2701	A
yeah	2701	A
yeah	2701	A
uh	2701	A
i i never got caught up in Twin- Twin Peaks either so	2701	A
yeah	2701	A
uh i don't know i don't hear people talk at work you know	2701	A
as far as uh	2701	A
you know what what people are getting into but uh	2701	A
um	2701	A
you know some of the top sitcoms obviously do you know always in the top five you know	2701	A
the Cosby or i think A Different World is real strong and	2701	A
uh	2701	A
yeah well that's the one it's the one right after Cosby and it's produced by Cosby and it's about it's basically about uh college	2701	A
uh	2701	A
you know and it it obvious- it's you know since- since it's kind of promoted by Cosby it's you know mostly blacks	2701	A
but uh but it's it's a pretty good show it uh	2701	A
have you ever heard of Jasmine Guy	2701	A
okay now she's one of the main stars of that and now she's just come out came out with an album	2701	A
and uh and which is fairly successful she's got one or two singles that have done very well so	2701	A
but she is a very strong personality in that show uh and uh	2701	A
it's your basic college and what people run into and they- in fact they just had a show covering AIDS	2701	A
so you know they try to get their messages across i should say	2701	A
uh-huh	2701	A
um not sure	2701	A
yeah	2701	A
yeah uh that one is is it still competing with Cosby	2701	A
such a brat	2701	A
honestly i'm indifferent	2701	A
i probably i probably will watch a little bit of everything uh i i i i get into movies i'll uh i'll see you know i'll watch 20/20 or i'll um	2701	A
and uh i guess i'm only mostly into sitcoms i guess my favorite- you know one show i'm really into is Arsenio Hall	2701	A
and uh	2701	A
and then you know i've been watching him for a long time now and i i needed a break and i watched Johnny Carson last night a little more level you know and so it's like i'm just	2701	A
think oh what do i feel like today you know we're getting option- our options on different talk shows and i always liked watching Letterman but he starts so late	2701	A
yeah well the the talk shows with the personality yeah and uh	2701	A
but uh Letterman starts pretty late out here about twelve o'clock	2701	A
but i'll still watch it once in a while	2701	A
yeah	2701	A
okay	2701	B
uh no actually i i don't i i don't uh it's funny i don't really seem to watch a lot of television what um i usually like to pick up on TV are some of the	2701	B
news type of shows like you know 20/20 60 Minutes	2701	B
and uh and i usually uh i just other than those i i catch movies once in a while i like a lot of the movies that are you know true stories true to life that type of thing	2701	B
um but i'm not i'm not real big on that much on television uh i don't have really many favorite shows that i i must see every week you know	2701	B
yeah yeah so uh anyway um	2701	B
but how about you then	2701	B
uh-huh	2701	B
well i find i do sit down with them when they have those those- they like a lot of those uh shows and often when they have them on	2701	B
that's when they're quiet i like sit sit down with them and watch it yeah	2701	B
yeah	2701	B
uh-huh	2701	B
do you watch uh Thirty Something	2701	B
yeah	2701	B
so you catch whatever might be on if you're interested that evening	2701	B
yeah	2701	B
uh-huh yeah yeah	2701	B
uh	2701	B
um i you know i wanted to and i forget- i really i kept seeing it advertised and i wanted to see that and i don't know we might not have been home or something excuse me and	2701	B
i didn't see that but i was really interested in in that i i found that a pretty interesting story that they said the church recognized that as as a real exorcism	2701	B
uh did you see that show	2701	B
and what what did you think what did they what uh was that all about	2701	B
uh-huh	2701	B
yeah my husband is too	2701	B
yeah	2701	B
uh-huh	2701	B
um	2701	B
oh	2701	B
okay	2701	B
hum	2701	B
it could be a multiple- like one of these multiple personality disorders	2701	B
also	2701	B
yeah	2701	B
huh	2701	B
it wasn't as dramatic as i guess maybe they made it seem	2701	B
right	2701	B
and well	2701	B
right	2701	B
right and also	2701	B
yeah	2701	B
um and also for the church to recognize it as a a true exorcism you know um usually they're such i think i really think that there's a fine line between what um	2701	B
you know a lot of people think is possessed and what are really mental disorders you know and maybe in the old days you know many years ago what they often said oh people were possessed we probably recognize now as schizophrenia or something	2701	B
um and uh you know it's it's it's hard to to say you know whether	2701	B
it's it's just a it's a mental disorder or it's really uh uh it's a or if it's a split personality or something	2701	B
<b_aside> wait honey i can't talk right now <e_aside> uh but um what i don't know now what area are you living in	2701	B
oh <b_aside> wait Jackie what <e_aside>	2701	B
<b_aside> yes okay okay go <e_aside> excuse me so	2701	B
uh no we are uh outside of Washington DC	2701	B
and i was just the reason i asked that i was curious i thought maybe in different parts of uh you know the country maybe there were certain shows that were more more popular than in other parts	2701	B
uh i don't know some of the other shows they watch um Twin Peaks you know and i'm not really into those shows and that really surprises people	2701	B
yeah yeah and i just i was just wondering demographically if you know if different parts if there were shows that were more popular than in other areas i don't know like where you live um you know what are the real	2701	B
what are the hot shows you know that everybody seems to want to watch	2701	B
uh-huh	2701	B
yeah	2701	B
uh-huh	2701	B
oh is that right so	2701	B
oh okay	2701	B
i see uh-huh	2701	B
and are all the kids into the Simpsons	2701	B
pardon me uh yes	2701	B
oh okay	2701	B
uh-huh	2701	B
i see	2701	B
and uh	2701	B
oh is that right	2701	B
yeah now there's a new show on and i can't think of the name of it apparently the producer of it was a	2701	B
Potomac resident um you know which is right right around here close to where we we are living you know the Potomac	2701	B
area outside of DC and and i i think he went to like Wooton High School here or something and and some of the papers that circulating the rumor that	2701	B
eh eh i eh it might be the Beverly Hills um there's that one called Beverly Hills one O two one O or something like that uh	2701	B
and uh that's becoming a little popular and of course the kids all like the Simpsons here	2701	B
and uh i guess it's the same there also	2701	B
um i'm not sure i don't know what's happened uh i know a lot of some of the parents won't let their kids watch it you know uh	2701	B
yeah but um it what what uh	2701	B
what changes would you like to see i mean in in in you know evening television do you think there should be more like news type programs like 20/20 or more comedies or weeklies	2701	B
you're indifferent it doesn't matter-	2701	B
yeah	2701	B
uh-huh	2701	B
uh-huh oh yeah i watch that uh-huh	2701	B
yeah	2701	B
you so you like some of these late shows	2701	B
yeah	2701	B
yeah talk shows yeah	2701	B
uh-huh	2701	B
right oh oh okay	2701	B
yeah yeah um i guess so i think also probably because people now there are so many	2701	B
uh everybody has VCR's and rents so many movies that might have i don't know that might have hurt some of the the popularity of certain shows you know a lot of things that they put on Saturday nights a lot of people	2701	B
i'll let you go first	2797	A
um-hum	2797	A
yeah i uh i spent a couple uh years down in uh Plano Texas	2797	A
and uh i was one of the home owners down there that got taxed to death for the uh Plano uh school system	2797	A
and uh i've you know i know that Texas doesn't have a state tax and so all the things come out of the the property taxes	2797	A
and i was uh really shocked at the amount of taxes i ended up paying i was i was better off paying a state tax back in Maryland where than i was uh paying the uh property tax down there	2797	A
uh what they did in Maryland to get around that is they uh they developed a renters tax solely for the purpose of paying for the services that the renters were getting including the uh educational services	2797	A
and uh the tax was administered by um	2797	A
the uh rental company that actually was managing the apartments so when uh long long time ago when i used to live in apartments i would pay a rent	2797	A
payment every month and a tax payment every month	2797	A
and the tax payment went to pay for the services that i was	2797	A
getting as a a resident of that particular county	2797	A
and uh that's the way it worked here in Maryland we have uh	2797	A
a certain portion of your your property taxes uh goes to education but also a portion of the state tax that you pay	2797	A
goes back into the county that you live in	2797	A
to pay for the educational system	2797	A
and so it it works out nice it it it makes it so that the	2797	A
uh whole county now i- i know the concept of counties in Texas is quite a bit different than it is here in Maryland uh like Collin County uh would only equal about maybe an eighth the size of Baltimore County here in Maryland	2797	A
i mean the the counties are much larger	2797	A
you know in the the whole state of Maryland i believe there's only like uh fifteen counties	2797	A
and so uh you know each county has their own school system an and it works out real nice um	2797	A
the the the flip side to this is are we getting what we're paying for and i don't believe so um a lot of things have come to head um recently and i heard a report because of uh	2797	A
uh the emphasis that the President was putting on education	2797	A
you know um him running as our education president and then finally a couple of years later getting around to doing something um	2797	A
they said since they imposed the federal regulations on education in other words they came up with this federalized system where everyone in the third grade would be taught basically the same thing	2797	A
and then at the end of uh school year they would be tested and then they go into the fourth grade and everybody in the fourth grade's basically taught the same thing so when they came up with these this nationwide system of public schools	2797	A
uh they gave some figures out and since it's inception uh they've the price has gone up per student- the prices paid by the federal government per student has been thirty three percent	2797	A
and so they're actually spending thirty three percent and that's real dollars you know that adjusting it back to to the days you know when it started uh probably you know seventy years ago	2797	A
and what they've said is that we haven't had a thirty three percent improvement in education	2797	A
we've actually gone backwards	2797	A
yeah	2797	A
yeah well they they've been having some problems uh even here in uh like Baltimore City which is a a pretty good city- good- good sized city	2797	A
uh they've been putting a lot of uh stress on it and of course speaking of stress the teachers are all getting stressed out from trying to you know do everything they're supposed to do and of course they've uh been cutting the teachers salaries because they say we don't have the money to do it and	2797	A
all the services are costing more money and and everything uh but the uh a lot of emphasis- now is being put on you know when children used to be taught	2797	A
you know like uh uh each child is individual you know they're not all the same	2797	A
and	2797	A
some students do horrible until like eighth grade some do horrible you know until they get to like tenth grade and then all of a sudden everything clicks in you know and then there are some students that you know read well at five years old	2797	A
and you know seem to excel and so that the you know one of the things i heard proposed on uh one of the public radio stations up here was that we should go back to teaching children at their own speed	2797	A
some kids	2797	A
yeah	2797	A
and and uh	2797	A
and on top of that they they make the child feel inferior	2797	A
because he's not as good as another kid his same age i mean it's like	2797	A
you know that's ridiculous	2797	A
yeah and uh you know i have uh i- i have five children total and i've got two out of the house already and i have- i have two that are in uh eighth grade this year	2797	A
and prior to their um	2797	A
when i when they were in elementary school they were identified- identified as being slow	2797	A
and so they put them into special programs and then we actually held them back in fourth grade	2797	A
and	2797	A
it wasn't until the last two years um last year my uh they're they're a set of twins um a boy and a girl last year the the uh boy twin started doing real well	2797	A
and it it it everything started to click in for him and he knew what he needed to do um and this year it it happened for uh for the daughter	2797	A
she just has been	2797	A
really doing great this year and she has the right attitude towards school and everything and i think it's just a matter of everybody has to find their own path i remember when i was in school i did horrible	2797	A
up until about	2797	A
yeah about the seventh eighth grade i- i- i started to to come around and realize an and basically i got interested in math and uh never really did well in English but you know once you got interested in something	2797	A
and things started to click in place	2797	A
then after that you take off	2797	A
um-hum	2797	A
yeah	2797	A
jeez	2797	A
yeah it is um my children had a uh real culture shock um when we lived in Plano i guess i don't know if you've heard about the Plano school district but they're uh they really stress academics there	2797	A
and uh God if your child is not an honor student well then you're something wrong with you as a parent and that- that's kind of the way they are there	2797	A
and uh when we moved back to Maryland um i moved to a uh a	2797	A
Baltimore County which is a northern county in Maryland	2797	A
and it's basically a rural county once you get above about the half way point	2797	A
and we lived you know in the northern part of the county uh we went from a uh	2797	A
middle school in Texas that served fifty five square blocks to a uh middle school in Maryland that served fifty five square miles	2797	A
and it was just a complete culture shock because i mean they they're riding on the bus in the morning with uh other kids that you know are a sleep because_1 they got up at three o'clock and were doing chores and you know it's	2797	A
and they had uh agricultural- they had an agricultural- course uh i forget what it was called uh but it goes along the the lines of industrial arts but it's agricultural and where they had to raise a small animal	2797	A
had to learn how to drive a tractor	2797	A
they actually had to go- take a driving test on the tractor i mean they just couldn't believe this and it was great they loved it	2797	A
i mean they really enjoyed the courses	2797	A
um	2797	A
and it you know it made school fun for them again because prior to that school was just a big pain a drain	2797	A
yeah and it was you know it was like kind of like the way we feel about going to work	2797	A
but uh up here they seem to have made it uh a lot of fun for them_1 and they they seem to really enjoy it	2797	A
well i think i don't know how your schools work back there but we support our schools here with property taxes	2797	B
and the land owners or home owners are the ones that pay the school tax	2797	B
so if you're renting a house or doing anything else you're not	2797	B
actually contributing to the education of your children	2797	B
and i think that's wrong i think everybody should contribute to the education of their children even if they had to raise the sales tax by one percent	2797	B
then everybody going through the state would be supporting our education system	2797	B
so	2797	B
as it turns out we don't really have a	2797	B
tremendous education system because they don't have the money they need to run it	2797	B
um-hum	2797	B
yeah	2797	B
yeah	2797	B
no	2797	B
yeah yeah you would be	2797	B
oh	2797	B
yeah	2797	B
uh	2797	B
gee	2797	B
yeah um	2797	B
yeah	2797	B
ah	2797	B
oh well that's pretty good	2797	B
oh yeah	2797	B
gee whiz	2797	B
yeah	2797	B
um-hum	2797	B
yeah	2797	B
yeah	2797	B
yeah	2797	B
yeah	2797	B
yeah	2797	B
no huh-uh	2797	B
well they say that Texas schools are some of the lowest in the nation that our high school graduates can't even match the national average	2797	B
so you know our school system down here is	2797	B
no where near perfect but they keep complaining they don't have the money to do it	2797	B
yeah	2797	B
oh yeah	2797	B
yep	2797	B
yeah	2797	B
yeah they need to take things at their own speed	2797	B
yeah	2797	B
um-hum	2797	B
yeah i think it'd be a lot better	2797	B
you know each child has to learn at his own rate they can't keep force feeding things to each other and	2797	B
or you know at the kids	2797	B
um-hum because_1 he can't do it	2797	B
yeah	2797	B
and it's not that he can't do it he just can't do it quite as fast or	2797	B
yeah	2797	B
all right	2797	B
yeah	2797	B
um-hum	2797	B
all right	2797	B
huh all right	2797	B
jumped on out there	2797	B
that's good	2797	B
yeah i did too up until ninth or tenth grade	2797	B
yeah	2797	B
yeah and see when i was a kid growing up and going to high school if i wanted to take a little electronics course i had a electronics course i could take but we lived out in the country and we didn't have all that	2797	B
fancy stuff to worry about you know we had our auto shop out there and our agricultural- shop and	2797	B
you know we had just about every thing that we needed but they don't have it anymore	2797	B
there's a lot of things that they don't do in school anymore	2797	B
our- our oldest boy goes to Lubbock High down here and they go to school four and half days a week	2797	B
so	2797	B
that's pretty weird	2797	B
no	2797	B
hum	2797	B
gee	2797	B
yeah	2797	B
um-hum	2797	B
yeah	2797	B
yeah	2797	B
yeah	2797	B
i can imagine	2797	B
yeah	2797	B
yeah that would be quite a shock	2797	B
um-hum	2797	B
oh like Four H then	2797	B
all right	2797	B
all right	2797	B
yeah just something you do everyday	2797	B
yeah yeah just something i have to do everyday	2797	B
that's good our oldest boy went into	2797	B
school politics and made vice	2797	B
okay	2794	A
damned if i know um	2794	A
i don't uh i suspect uh let's see i suspect we should do what everyone says we should do we should cut spending and maybe even raise taxes but Lord knows you shouldn't- one shouldn't say that	2794	A
i- i- i suspect we should probably have an independent auditing agency go in and look at how the government spends money	2794	A
and work from there	2794	A
because i because_1 i don't think they're very good at it	2794	A
um	2794	A
yes	2794	A
yeah well	2794	A
why- why- why- why do you say that actually	2794	A
hum	2794	A
yes	2794	A
rather than using taxed	2794	A
oh that's interesting yeah that's probably true i mean well we also we'd be spending less because all the money that that normally goes to support those people aren't working it's back in the system	2794	A
so you're right that's a real neat idea well what but i mean what can you know at at some point what can you do to sort of raise revenue- i mean to raise jobs i wonder	2794	A
oh okay so	2794	A
start when	2794	A
but that is not gonna work uh	2794	A
hum	2794	A
and that way just create more jobs	2794	A
or whatever	2794	A
hum um-hum well that's a neat idea	2794	A
yeah that's what that's what you- you think space would do that much for that or	2794	A
hum	2794	A
like what	2794	A
oh you think you think that would uh have a major effect well that would put a lot of criminals out of business for a while anyway	2794	A
that- that might have a um a good effect on on on crime anyway	2794	A
that's probably true	2794	A
and probably a lot of	2794	A
yeah but that's potentially you know	2794	A
um-hum um	2794	A
no i'd never thought about that	2794	A
um-hum	2794	A
that's true we do often times they are paid more yeah	2794	A
right	2794	A
that's just what on their part i'm sorry i missed that	2794	A
oh	2794	A
um-hum	2794	A
that that maybe true that's very true	2794	A
right	2794	A
right that's uh	2794	A
um-hum	2794	A
yeah and maybe even reduce along- along the same lines maybe reduce imports as well i think	2794	A
i mean we don't need to buy other people's stuff right now	2794	A
right well that that's what happened in other country though and other places they tax us quite heavily- i mean they tax American imports quite heavily so we could do the same thing i mean just and you know they may get	2794	A
right it does seem only fair i mean why not	2794	A
i- i think so	2794	A
yes	2794	A
oh really	2794	A
oh really i love the switch	2794	A
well at that point you might we it- it- it wouldn't be a problem anymore possibly you know we would be	2794	A
we would be able to keep it wherever we wanted to in space or the ocean research whatever we wanted to do	2794	A
but i think that would be	2794	A
right	2794	A
um-hum	2794	A
right	2794	A
is compared to defense well that's a good idea well i well the other thing and the other thing i- i- i think we seriously need to do is um	2794	A
like i say have someone go in and look and you know and find out where it is we're paying ten thousand dollars per toilet seat or something	2794	A
greed i suspect	2794	A
um-hum	2794	A
yes	2794	A
really	2794	A
for making the government issue under wear	2794	A
Jesus	2794	A
um-hum	2794	A
well its potentially a fault of the government than i mean that could be thing like that should be i mean	2794	A
right well that's a i had never heard that before	2794	A
right	2794	A
hum	2794	A
oh okay so you know about some of these things yeah	2794	A
so how do we fix the national budget	2794	B
well	2794	B
that would probably be good	2794	B
but	2794	B
something	2794	B
that the government hasn't been looking at	2794	B
is	2794	B
the source of the problem	2794	B
the true source of the problem	2794	B
is A that we do spend too much	2794	B
but also B that we don't take in enough	2794	B
uh	2794	B
too few Americans are working	2794	B
if more Americans were working and meaningful	2794	B
good paying labor	2794	B
and paying taxes	2794	B
and the tax structure was fair between	2794	B
the	2794	B
lowest and the highest income Americans	2794	B
then we would have more money there to play with	2794	B
right	2794	B
well	2794	B
i	2794	B
hesitate to say we ought to spend ourselves	2794	B
to	2794	B
affluence	2794	B
but in fact	2794	B
in some cases that's what we ought to do	2794	B
not {Reaganomics} thank you	2794	B
uh what i was thinking more along the lines of	2794	B
is start going to space	2794	B
well	2794	B
at some point there there will be	2794	B
enough	2794	B
jobs	2794	B
for	2794	B
most of the able- able-bodied Americans	2794	B
we also need to uh	2794	B
assure that there's some work in the private sector	2794	B
i think it would do something for it i think we would fill up new technologies	2794	B
but i think we should also	2794	B
do something rather radical	2794	B
legalize marijuana	2794	B
what	2794	B
yes uh okay i think it would	2794	B
take some of that money	2794	B
out of the hands of criminals i think it would put	2794	B
reduce the amount of carry on drug use where people advance from one drug to another	2794	B
i think that	2794	B
i think most importantly	2794	B
it would give the federal government something new that they could tax	2794	B
and probably a lot of and really receive some revenues from	2794	B
uh if you	2794	B
look at prohibition	2794	B
historically	2794	B
it's repeal	2794	B
helped the federal government a lot	2794	B
in tax revenues	2794	B
then i think once we put	2794	B
money back into the coffers- in the coffers of the federal government	2794	B
and get the federal government	2794	B
to- where	2794	B
there's money there again	2794	B
we should reduce	2794	B
the amount of money	2794	B
and this would have to come rather quickly	2794	B
and would have to come- come originally also	2794	B
where we're not paying	2794	B
in some cases we do pay more for	2794	B
welfare recipients to live then they can earn	2794	B
in the true minimum wage	2794	B
environment	2794	B
and	2794	B
you can't	2794	B
deny people the right	2794	B
to supply	2794	B
their families better through whatever means	2794	B
that's just sensible on their part	2794	B
it's just sensible on their parts to go after the	2794	B
the the greater amount of income	2794	B
so if you	2794	B
lower the amount they make and	2794	B
raise the amount of true minimum wage jobs not those that are affected by the federal minimum wage	2794	B
then	2794	B
more people will get off welfare	2794	B
you know give them a true incentive to want to work	2794	B
and then	2794	B
don't	2794	B
start	2794	B
letting more	2794	B
outsiders in	2794	B
for a few years -until we figure exactly where we're at with unemployment	2794	B
reduce	2794	B
immigration	2794	B
or eliminate it entirely for a few years until we get our own house in order	2794	B
oh absolutely absolutely	2794	B
that's right when we're in a world of hurt	2794	B
well i don't i'm not going to say	2794	B
that we ought to reduce-	2794	B
reduce them through legal means i think we ought to just tax them severely	2794	B
it seems only fair	2794	B
and i think really if we got all those that are able-bodied into the work force	2794	B
reduced	2794	B
the amount going out for those purposes created new jobs for that work force	2794	B
there would be plenty of money	2794	B
and then at that point	2794	B
quit spending on space	2794	B
force it all into the into the private sector	2794	B
that's right	2794	B
uh uh space was just a convenient	2794	B
place for me to go because	2794	B
that would put a lot of a lot of Millspec and NASA work operates to the same demanding specifications that would put a bunch of defense workers back to work	2794	B
you know what causes that	2794	B
uh no	2794	B
your	2794	B
your your buying large trunk	2794	B
uh	2794	B
the government specification	2794	B
sheets of paper	2794	B
for building a pair of BVD underwear	2794	B
for the federal government	2794	B
is twenty two foot tall	2794	B
if it was all on nine by elevens stacked one on top of another	2794	B
for making government issue underwear	2794	B
to just understand	2794	B
those legal requirements	2794	B
and operate within the government guidelines	2794	B
costs the company	2794	B
a huge amount of money	2794	B
yes a huge amount of it is not the fault of the contractor	2794	B
uh	2794	B
a huge amount of what you hear on about the seventy five dollar hammers	2794	B
and the	2794	B
nine hundred dollar	2794	B
toilet seats	2794	B
doesn't come from people in the industry it comes from senators that don't know anything about it	2794	B
uh	2794	B
my job is	2794	B
government tooling specialist	2794	B
okay are you on any kind of uh regular exercise plan	2789	B
step classes	2789	B
what's that	2789	B
oh instead of hopping and jumping your just stepping	2789	B
oh okay	2789	B
huh	2789	B
i probably couldn't do that because_1 of my knee	2789	B
yeah	2789	B
yeah	2789	B
yeah i've	2789	B
i've kind of gotten out of the habit myself i mean it's i guess what i do now is i play softball right now that's about well right now i'm on two teams so it's four nights a week but uh	2789	B
uh so i enjoy it but	2789	B
as far as you know uh instead of having to join a health club and make myself go out there i went and bought a weight bench and don't ever hardly use it need to need to make myself do that	2789	B
what school you going to	2789	B
oh	2789	B
now what's what's toning is that lifting- lifting weights	2789	B
oh okay isometrics stuff like that	2789	B
yeah	2789	B
um-hum	2789	B
yeah i	2789	B
stayed in pretty good shape during school i played baseball all the way through and you know working out six hours a day usually six or seven days a week that kind of kept us all in pretty good shape	2789	B
but uh ever ever since i got out of school you know just jumped right into the job and	2789	B
i guess the job that i'm in it's stuff to stay on any kind of a regular schedule	2789	B
because i work some weird hours and do some traveling and	2789	B
yeah	2789	B
no i didn't have well much of a problem- we the i guess i went to a small Baptist school and we had about when i was there maybe thirteen hundred people so it's pretty small yeah	2789	B
but i usually get in at least a couple of miles at work just walking around the plant	2789	B
so	2789	B
uh we've got a one story house now that's that's enough i guess i push the lawn mower around that's fairly regular	2789	B
yeah	2789	B
what just because_1 you you don't like to or because_1 because_1 you won't be able to	2789	B
oh if you do if you do aerobics you shouldn't have any problem running	2789	B
we've we've ride our bike occasionally but again not nearly often enough	2789	B
no you can't forget how to ride a bike	2789	B
yeah	2789	B
now when i was going to i i went to a junior college for a couple of years and played baseball and then transferred well when we were at this junior college uh	2789	B
our coach you know we one semester the whole team was required to take aerobics and the next semester they were required to do weight lifting	2789	B
so they uh i mean it was a regular i mean we had it for course credit but still i mean it was pretty high impact stuff	2789	B
um-hum	2789	B
yeah and she'd uh you know most of the guys were all in one class so she'd kind of lay it on occasionally you know	2789	B
first thing eight i think we had eight o'clock in the morning was our class	2789	B
wake up	2789	B
um-hum	2789	B
yeah i think my wife has some	2789	B
um-hum	2789	B
or sand even some of them well no they're elastic so i guess it wouldn't be sand	2789	B
hum	2789	B
yeah	2789	B
yeah	2789	B
so are you going to get into instructing well what are you studying	2789	B
oh okay not in the not in the	2789	B
aerobic instructor type field	2789	B
yeah	2789	B
yeah the uh the some of the Nautilus equipment that i started seeing at the one that we used to go to was really interesting i mean they they they really know how to isolate each of the different muscle groups	2789	B
with those things but man they are	2789	B
ah uh i don't know to me that was just too much of a hassle to get all geared up and take the time to drive over there and workout and then drive back	2789	B
a little negative reinforcement there while you're going	2789	B
yeah	2789	B
yeah that's that's where i'm really starting to get noticeable i'm just getting real soft in the middle	2789	B
um-hum i haven't really started to put on a lot of weight i'm i guess i probably put on about ten nine or ten pounds since i stopped playing which was about four years ago	2789	B
but i've just myself i just notice myself just really real soft and i'm sure i don't have near the endurance that i did	2789	B
but i i intend i keep saying i intend to get back into it	2789	B
i just need to	2789	B
put the old nose to the grindstone i i i guess at that point it would turn into a task	2789	B
i don't consider it fun doing that but	2789	B
next weekend all right	2789	B
yeah oh no yeah there there's no no question the the end result is great and i i mean i enjoyed you know we when- when i was playing ball we could like run all day and not be tired you know	2789	B
yeah	2789	B
um-hum	2789	B
oh i still don't but	2789	B
that's a problem	2789	B
well good luck on your graduation and your	2789	B
yeah you too	2789	B
bye	2789	B
i i yeah i'm	2789	A
yeah i i do aerobics uh step classes and um	2789	A
toning classes yes	2789	A
it's um it's a new uh form i think uh it's like low impact aerobics but at it	2789	A
um-hum yeah you you have a step and you literally step up on the step and move your arms it's it's it's it's new it's fun	2789	A
uh-huh bad knee	2789	A
um and uh i do toning a lot and uh some every once in a while i play tennis	2789	A
i'm not too great at it but i- try- i try to play	2789	A
um-hum	2789	A
gosh	2789	A
um-hum	2789	A
uh-huh	2789	A
right yeah-	2789	A
yeah i slacked off a little because of um	2789	A
i'm about to graduate from college and so this past couple months have been really hectic so i haven't really gone and i've really been faithful these past two months of going to the health club and working out but	2789	A
i'm at East Carolina	2789	A
but um	2789	A
no i uh my step classes and toning is about the only thing well i mean	2789	A
it's- it's um like isolated movements for each muscle certain muscles groups you can do with	2789	A
yeah you can do it with certain you know you can do it with weights if you wanted to but you know you leave out of there usually the next morning if you haven't done it in a while you wake up the next morning you're like oh no what did i do to myself and your whole body aches you know um	2789	A
i know i'm looking forward to getting back into	2789	A
getting into shape uh	2789	A
feel like i'm out of shape but i feel guilty for not going because_1 i really i'm i'm so used to going for you know three or four years now but um	2789	A
uh-huh	2789	A
oh yeah	2789	A
oh yeah	2789	A
um-hum	2789	A
uh-huh	2789	A
uh-huh	2789	A
no some	2789	A
um	2789	A
i walk a lot because uh you know being in in school we i don't know if your campus was anything like ours but our parking lot's in one end of the of the campus and the school the buildings are all at the other end so	2789	A
uh-huh oh okay that's if yeah	2789	A
yeah	2789	A
um-hum	2789	A
yeah it's uh	2789	A
i live i live on the second story apartments so i walk up and down stairs all day long so	2789	A
uh	2789	A
yeah	2789	A
that's one of the exercise now i i um	2789	A
would like to start running	2789	A
i've never been much of a runner but i want to start i want to run but i don't i don't know if i'll be able to to- to do it	2789	A
i'm i'm afraid i won't be able to i wish i'd	2789	A
yeah i hope not	2789	A
oh	2789	A
uh-huh i don't even own a bike i think the last time i was on a bike was when i was about twelve so	2789	A
uh i don't know i'd be afraid afraid i probably forgot how to ride a bike you know	2789	A
yeah but um	2789	A
no i guess	2789	A
that's about the only form i'm trying to think of of other things that i do that	2789	A
would be considered exercise or things i should do	2789	A
i know	2789	A
uh-huh	2789	A
uh-huh	2789	A
those aerobic classes are are tough the the high impact	2789	A
definitely are are tough classes	2789	A
uh-huh	2789	A
uh-huh	2789	A
well now they have those uh	2789	A
those exercise bands now that are better that you can use for like toning instead of using a weight you have like bands i don't know if you've seen them they're	2789	A
yeah they're weird- they're weird they're uh you get uh	2789	A
they're just made of i guess it's different kinds of rubber uh and they get	2789	A
uh-huh and there's some that	2789	A
like the different colors denotes how much they	2789	A
how much the tension i guess they are and how easy they are to move	2789	A
uh there's like i know there's purple gray and uh green and some of them are real short and they're the ones that are the tough ones to use you know	2789	A
but uh	2789	A
those classes i i enjoy uh i think uh	2789	A
with the aerobic classes you have to get an instructor that's	2789	A
fun if you don't have one that's fun and not enjoy it look not acting like she's enjoying what she's doing the class is not going to get out uh what they should get out of the class	2789	A
uh	2789	A
if the	2789	A
oh i'm an interior design major	2789	A
oh no no no no oh i could never do that i don't think	2789	A
i'd rather just be the student	2789	A
and uh	2789	A
oh occasionally i do the weights at the health club but	2789	A
low weights just	2789	A
um-hum	2789	A
um-hum	2789	A
right well they um i just noticed at our health club they	2789	A
they put on these computerized one these computerized machines and you set a speed on it and the weight and it and it makes you do it and it tells you like if you're going too slow it will say my grandmother could do this faster than you	2789	A
and stuff like a turtle goes faster and um it tells it and the whole place can hear what this machine is telling you	2789	A
yeah	2789	A
so uh do that stuff like that but just i've never used those machines i just use the regular	2789	A
machines and the free weights you know like little five pound hand weights and eight pound hand weights	2789	A
just to do you know some bicep tricep exercises	2789	A
sit-ups of course	2789	A
uh-huh	2789	A
oh yeah	2789	A
i think that's uh number one problem with everyone	2789	A
uh-huh	2789	A
yeah	2789	A
uh-huh	2789	A
yeah	2789	A
um-hum	2789	A
right yeah i plan on getting back once i graduate next weekend	2789	A
next weekend yeah one week then i plan to get right back into it	2789	A
you know it's it does a lot for you i think makes you feel a lot better	2789	A
uh-huh and i mean you feel so much better about yourself just that you know	2789	A
you don't feel guilty when you eat that cake after dinner	2789	A
oh yeah	2789	A
yeah	2789	A
{alrighty} well thank you it was nice talking to you okay bye-bye	2789	A
oh yes i love uh Mexican and uh Oriental foods	2769	B
both so uh i could say Enchiladas down on Greenville Avenue in Dallas Texas	2769	B
is uh a real good Mexican	2769	B
and we like uh stir fry Hunan style over in Addison	2769	B
oh yeah yeah i enjoy	2769	B
and good food in the Blue Goose yeah that is a good place where do you like to eat	2769	B
uh-huh	2769	B
favorite spot	2769	B
oh yeah	2769	B
yeah that's good what- what other kind of food interesting-	2769	B
uh-huh	2769	B
uh-huh	2769	B
Schlotzky's is probably my favorite deli deli sandwich i guess because of the bread the uh roll	2769	B
uh-huh	2769	B
sounds good	2769	B
that's true that is true	2769	B
well both uh probably eat out for dinner say once or twice a week	2769	B
and i eat out for lunch probably three times a week	2769	B
so	2769	B
uh-huh	2769	B
yeah	2769	B
uh-huh there is a new Italian restaurant that is really good	2769	B
uh on Greenville it's uh La Fontana or something like that it's right after you cross uh six thirty five on Greenville	2769	B
it is actually the family has not been here even a year in the states	2769	B
it's real authentic Italian food and their deserts are fabulous so if you like Italian that that's a really good place to go	2769	B
uh-huh i haven't tried that is- is it good	2769	B
because i live in Plano too	2769	B
uh-huh	2769	B
yeah	2769	B
yeah that means a lot to me too nonsmoking	2769	B
yeah	2769	B
um	2769	B
let's see what was	2769	B
uh what about steaks	2769	B
where you use for a good steak	2769	B
uh-huh	2769	B
right	2769	B
uh-huh	2769	B
oh well that's good because i i know Steak and Ale is	2769	B
a favorite prime rib that they have is is usually what i get and	2769	B
i was real pleased now i haven't had prime rib at the Hoffbrau but	2769	B
really	2769	B
yeah	2769	B
yeah	2769	B
oh yeah	2769	B
oh	2769	B
uh-huh	2769	B

one of those things you got to go early you know to find a seat yeah	2769	B
yeah	2769	B
let's see- uh fish- as far as fish i think my favorite place is uh Dinger's over- over on Forest Lane	2769	B
oh it's very good very good	2769	B

it's pretty good and	2769	B
yeah	2769	B
uh-huh	2769	B
great- yeah yeah	2769	B
yeah	2769	B
uh-huh	2769	B
also in the shopping center you know where BG's uh Zaks is that little craft shopping center	2769	B
there's a a home if you want just like a plate you know home cooked meal that's good- it's called BG's	2769	B
and every day they have like a plate lunch special and it's fairly cheap it's like two ninety five or three fifty	2769	B
and it's real good	2769	B
so	2769	B
that's oh it's just kind of a mom and pop restaurant that's	2769	B
uh vegetables like a couple vegetables and a meat an and roll and	2769	B
quick usually really quick too so	2769	B
i have never tried any	2769	B
uh-huh	2769	B
uh-huh	2769	B
i was going to say how does it compare are the spices different	2769	B
uh-huh	2769	B
oh okay more like an entree	2769	B
and and vegetable	2769	B
okay okay	2769	B
how wild	2769	B

i have a friend that goes frequents- she frequents	2769	B
and Indian place over there by The Blue Ribbon Cafe	2769	B
i'm sure- oh it's uh right there in Richardson on the west side of seventy five	2769	B
and uh she i've never got the courage to go but	2769	B
that's once a week place for her	2769	B
so yeah	2769	B
well what about TI's cafeteria do you ever	2769	B
uh	2769	B
oh gosh	2769	B
yeah	2769	B
that's the only thing that's safe	2769	B
yeah yeah the burrito you can only handle every so often	2769	B
yeah	2769	B
right	2769	B
do you have any favorite restaurants in the area	2769	A
oh okay sounds great	2769	A
i've been there	2769	A
uh-huh	2769	A
have you ever tried the Blue Goose on Greenville Avenue	2769	A
they serve a lot of food	2769	A
i usually go to El Chico once a week for lunch Thursdays Fridays whatever	2769	A
and uh China Market in uh Keystone	2769	A
so	2769	A
oh i like just about everything uh sandwich shops uh Schlotzky's	2769	A
uh	2769	A
restaurants that have a variety of food like uh Chili's or Bennigan's TGI Friday's	2769	A
uh-huh	2769	A
yeah i go to Galligaskins' too quite a bit	2769	A
but uh yeah Schlotzky's is unique as they say different is better	2769	A
do you typically go out uh for lunch or for dinner	2769	A
uh-huh	2769	A
yeah i usually hit the favorite lunch spots uh every week uh being El Chico and China Market	2769	A
sometimes Schlotzky's uh	2769	A
places like that during during lunch	2769	A
uh i don't get out too much on the weekends but uh i'll occasionally go to an Italian restaurant or a Chinese restaurant	2769	A
okay i've never been there	2769	A
uh-huh	2769	A
yeah i live up in Plano so i usually go to some place like uh A Taste of Italy	2769	A
uh yeah i think it's good it's uh	2769	A
okay i've been to uh Primavera also	2769	A
i like that it's a little smaller and they don't have as large uh uh smoking- a nonsmoking section to put it that way	2769	A
uh so it it and it it gets gets quite crowded at at uh times especially on weekends	2769	A
right	2769	A
steak oh yeah they opened up the Hoffbrau here about uh what two years ago in Plano	2769	A
and that's very good i take uh some- some of my relatives there aunts and uncles a couple months ago to the Hoffbrau and they're dairy farmers so they're real picky about their steak but they were impressed	2769	A
uh-huh	2769	A
they don't i don't think they serve prime rib it's mostly just a steak shop uh Steak and Ale's a little more upscale than Hoffbrau	2769	A
but the Hoffbrau's kind of neat in that they've got uh that market there too	2769	A
and those uh shops with all the crafts so while you're waiting for uh for a seat you get to kind- uh to browse around and see what what they've got in the farmer's market	2769	A
they've got a wait even on weeknights uh usually between a half hour and forty five minutes	2769	A
so uh and it starts uh anywhere from from five o'clock on	2769	A
as far as burgers uh yeah i like Wendy's	2769	A
uh i do not care for Burger King	2769	A
i cannot eat their Whoppers	2769	A
uh McDonald's i avoid	2769	A
i used to work there as a teenager	2769	A
so uh once you've worked in a place like that uh oh i don't know you don't- i'm kind of reluctant to go back	2769	A
i know how the food is prepared	2769	A
uh-huh	2769	A
yeah uh Arby's is good too except i don't care for the roast beef the chicken is good	2769	A
uh-huh	2769	A
they're opening up a new restaurant in about a month uh in Keystone called Razzoo's it's going to be a Cajun restaurant	2769	A
right same building	2769	A
Flamingo used to be the Cactus before that	2769	A
but the Flamingo never quite made it i went there one time an was not impressed	2769	A
Razzoo's	2769	A
uh-huh	2769	A
i don't think so um it it looks brand new in fact we stopped by one time at lunch to uh talk to the guy who is redoing it and uh he was real excited and gung ho	2769	A
they've got their chef and their recipes all lined up and they're ready to start business	2769	A
but they're renovating the place right now it will take about another month i guess before they open up	2769	A
Eduardo's yeah i i went there a couple of times i was there for the grand opening	2769	A
a friend of mine and myself were the second and third customers he had at that the restaurant	2769	A
but uh it's a little heavy for lunch	2769	A
you get yeah too much pasta	2769	A
i i don't really care for that type of food for lunch	2769	A
so usually a sandwich uh maybe uh well- El Chico once a week or once every other week something like that	2769	A
Super Salads is good	2769	A
yeah they get crowded real quick	2769	A
the crowd's a little dressier too more of a yuppie crowd	2769	A
Dinger's i've never tried that okay	2769	A
okay	2769	A
yeah i stop by uh oh what's the name of this place Long John Silvers every now and then	2769	A
for uh fish greasy fish	2769	A
but every now and then you get into the mood for something like that	2769	A
yeah i sure do	2769	A
uh-huh	2769	A
i don't think i've ever heard of that before	2769	A
uh-huh	2769	A
what do you think about Korean food	2769	A
there is a place called the Korean Rib on uh i think it's on Alma	2769	A
or is it on Custer	2769	A
it's up here in Plano anyway	2769	A
and uh it's very good i uh really thought it was well- it's it's a lot like Chinese food	2769	A
um	2769	A
i- it well they have different dishes uh it's not so much just a lot of rice with uh with something dumped on top they uh	2769	A
uh they've they've got more type- uh specialty type uh meals i guess you'd say	2769	A
yeah uh	2769	A
uh-huh something like that yeah	2769	A
i've also tried uh a Korean restaurant in Dallas	2769	A
uh i can't remember what it's called but they have a dish called uh B Bim Bap	2769	A
it's uh vegetables with uh fried egg on top	2769	A
that and uh Mongolian beef	2769	A
typical dishes there	2769	A
i uh haven't let's see i think i've been in an Indian restaurant one time	2769	A
and they uh i i really don't care for curry that much	2769	A
okay i don't know where that is either	2769	A
uh-huh	2769	A
sounds different	2769	A
uh yeah i eat there quite a quite a bit usually chicken fried steak	2769	A
mashed potatoes and cream gravy	2769	A
i used to eat the Mexican food but i lost the taste for that	2769	A
uh-huh	2769	A
sandwiches are okay but there are better places to go the prices are not that cheap at the cafeteria	2769	A
it uh so- not	2769	A
well what what kind of car did you just buy a car or are you in the market to buy a car or	2736	B
uh	2736	B
um-hum	2736	B
uh-huh	2736	B
yeah	2736	B
um-hum	2736	B
yeah i- i seem to remember when i was young that was a problem	2736	B
but no no car was big enough for that	2736	B
uh-huh	2736	B
um-hum	2736	B
yeah yeah	2736	B
um-hum which is the one that has modular type seats you know which one i'm talking about they have the commercial on TV where you can you can pull some seats out and you can move around	2736	B
is that is that the Dodge Caravan that does that or	2736	B
uh-huh	2736	B
uh-huh	2736	B
yeah	2736	B
uh-huh	2736	B
well the one that i can't remember one it is but it's the	2736	B
if it's the Toyota or	2736	B
or one of the other ones i don't know if it's one of the Americans or the import ones where uh they actually have like um	2736	B
some bucket seats in the back but you can actually pull them out i mean they're really easy to pull out	2736	B
um and you can uh move them around and stuff and it it to me	2736	B
that- that would be real good for us uh my husband and i uh like to go camping and stuff and right now we have a van which is it's an older van and we're we're thinking about buying another sedan	2736	B
um probably next year	2736	B
um right now motorcycles is takes precedence since that that's what my husband really wants right now	2736	B
but uh next year we'll probably buy a new car and we're looking at uh possibly the Honda Accord	2736	B
um	2736	B
that's kind of uh	2736	B
as far as far as the interior it's got the luxury interior but doesn't- it doesn't really have the luxury price tag that a lot of the other cars have	2736	B
which is one of the things that we were looking at you know finding something that's that's fairly affordable but yet has all the nice luxury items that we want	2736	B
yeah	2736	B
uh-huh	2736	B
yeah well i think it's going to be a lot easier now i just heard that they lowered the prime lending rate	2736	B
so i think it's going to be a lot easier to to be able to get a car now and finance it	2736	B
i think banks are going to be a lot more a little bit more lenient	2736	B
yeah	2736	B
uh-huh	2736	B
yeah i can imagine you got to kind of work work that into your budget that- balance that and the house payment and of course uh is if you buy a new car you're going to are any of your kids driving age yet	2736	B
are so- are they twins	2736	B
oh wow	2736	B
uh-huh	2736	B
uh-huh	2736	B
uh-huh	2736	B
well the the Honda's have been have been very safe in in accidents uh more so than a lot of the American cars as a matter of fact i just heard something today on on the news about	2736	B
those uh automatic seat belts that are attached to the door um they're questioning the safety of those now	2736	B
saying that and they showed uh a simulation where there were- they had a dummy in the car and the door opened and the dummy actually fell out of the car and the car rolled out on top of him	2736	B
so they're saying they're not as safe as they give the appearance of being safe but they're really not as safe as they as they uh appear to be	2736	B
so um	2736	B
i'm kind of concerned about that as far as you know what- the seat belts	2736	B
uh i don't know if Maryland has a uh a seat belt law but they do have one in Texas and you're you're required to wear them	2736	B
exactly but	2736	B
ninety uh probably about well i don't know about ninety but probably fifty percent of the people that have those probably don't wear the lap portion of it	2736	B
i know my brother doesn't and he has one in his car	2736	B
so i mean it it kind of gives you a false sense of security you think oh i've got one portion of my seat belt on	2736	B
um but if your door comes open	2736	B
you know it's not going to do you any good	2736	B
so that that that's a concern of mine as far as uh what i'll be looking at with- with buying a new car um	2736	B
i'm not really sure if i would want the seat belts attached to the door i think i would feel better with them attached to the actual car the inside where they're normally attached to like behind the door	2736	B
uh-huh	2736	B
hum	2736	B
yeah	2736	B
yeah yeah	2736	B
yeah	2736	B
yeah the the Le Mans is like that too uh we used to have a Le Mans when i was in in high school	2736	B
um and it was a big car i mean it was like the uh the Grand Prix	2736	B
and in i think around nineteen eighty um	2736	B
they changed the model and it like went- went to half the size	2736	B
literally i mean it got chopped in half and it wasn't even the same car anymore didn't even remotely resemble the old car	2736	B
yeah well everybody that i've talked to who's ever had a Honda loves them and my husband had a Honda	2736	B
uh and it was a lease car and he had to turn back in uh a year and a half ago	2736	B
uh and he had it for four years and never had a single problem with it and it was great	2736	B
um and the only reason why we ended up not buying it was because	2736	B
we didn't feel the at at the time the residual was like sixty five hundred dollars and it was a four year old car with seventy thousand miles on it and we thought that was a little bit too much to pay for	2736	B
um a four year old car	2736	B
so	2736	B
so we ended up just went just went ahead and just turned the keys back in and and got out of the lease	2736	B
um	2736	B
one thing that i that i am curious about is um reading information on air bags do some of the vans i think i don't know about the Dodge Caravan but some of the vans now- now have um driver side air bags	2736	B
which i think is a good idea	2736	B
actually i'm real close to being in the market to buy a car i've got uh a couple older cars they're both over ten years old	2736	A
and uh they've served me well	2736	A
but i kind of would like to get a more uh gas efficient car and a newer model something looks a little nicer	2736	A
uh i've got three children at home two fourteen year olds and a twelve year old	2736	A
and so i need to make sure i've got one that i can fit	2736	A
all five of us into and if you if you know anything about teenagers it's kind of hard to get them to sit together for any amount of time	2736	A
well uh i've kind of been leaning towards a Caravan	2736	A
uh now i know that that uh they've gotten quite pricey in the last couple of years	2736	A
but uh i like the Dodge products	2736	A
and uh been uh couple times i've had a opportunity to rent one	2736	A
uh i've been really pleased with its performance and with the size	2736	A
and because if you get the seven passenger version you can put some space between the kids	2736	A
and uh i think that would that would serve us well plus it's got uh good storage capacity in it for you know taking things along going to the store	2736	A
um-hum exactly correct	2736	A
yeah if you want	2736	A
yes	2736	A
yeah it uh the Dodge Caravans will do that	2736	A
uh you can take the uh uh usually there's a uh a double seat behind the uh front buckets	2736	A
and then if you get the and then there's a three seat that goes or three person seat that goes in the back now what you can do is you could take that middle seat out	2736	A
and just have the three seats in the back and the two seats up front or you can take the uh three seat out and just use the two seat or you can take the two seat and move the two seat to the back	2736	A
so it's very versatile you can move the seats all around that's the only thing you can't do is take that three person across seat and move it forward	2736	A
uh-huh	2736	A
uh-huh	2736	A
yeah	2736	A
uh-huh	2736	A
yeah i think that's getting to be kind of important now that uh you know the price is becoming	2736	A
the driving factor and then you look at once you realize how much money you've got to spend then you start looking around at at what you can buy with it where before i think you	2736	A
you looked at the car you wanted and then you looked to see how well you could afford it	2736	A
or how you could afford it	2736	A
yeah	2736	A
yeah i know they're trying to do everything they can to uh end the recession	2736	A
and dropping the prime is probably one of the things i just bought a new house so	2736	A
i got a a uh nine and a half percent interest rate	2736	A
not sure i could do much better today	2736	A
but uh that is also effecting buying a new car	2736	A
well that and there-	2736	A
uh two fourteen year olds will be uh fifteen on the fourth of July	2736	A
so	2736	A
yeah they're twins born on the bicentennial	2736	A
you're going to have twins have them on the bicentennial is our motto July fourth seventy six	2736	A
so uh uh i've still got another full year and three months before they're going to be	2736	A
behind the wheel of a car so America's safe for another fifteen month	2736	A
and uh after that	2736	A
now i may keep the uh one or both of the two cars i i currently have for them to drive you know they're they're	2736	A
they're small enough that a first time driver could handle it yet big enough that i feel safe- feel safe that if they were in an accident they would survive	2736	A
you know what i mean it i don't get that kind of feeling with the kind of car like you talked about the Honda	2736	A
they're just	2736	A
uh-huh	2736	A
is that right	2736	A
uh-huh	2736	A
right	2736	A
jeez	2736	A
well	2736	A
yes definitely	2736	A
the thing is that they're i think it's a two part seat belt though there's the uh door belt and then there's one a lap belt	2736	A
then make sure you smack him around then	2736	A
yeah	2736	A
yeah	2736	A
yeah the uh the supports	2736	A
um a good source of information i've found has always been these uh used car manuals	2736	A
because you can flip through the used car manuals and they'll give you a list of all the problems that the car's had in the past	2736	A
and you can look at the uh the track record on a car over the year and you usually notice uh a lot of problems at the beginning and then things kind of iron out to where there's fewer problems and you get an idea on how well	2736	A
the the next car's going to be now as long as they aren't changing the model you know like when the uh Pontiac Grand Prix went from being a huge car to a small car they had a lot of problems with the smaller car as long as they aren't	2736	A
uh-huh	2736	A
yeah sure	2736	A
uh-huh	2736	A
yeah i remember when that happened so unless they're really changing the model	2736	A
um	2736	A
yeah chances are that it's probably going to have the the fewer mistakes than it had the year before	2736	A
uh-huh	2736	A
yeah	2736	A
yeah i agree	2736	A
uh-huh	2736	A
yeah-	2736	A
yeah i do i own a um i own an i an an X T clone it's a Samsung and uh with a Hyundai monitor monochrome monitor that i just keep at home for work	2783	B
and acts as a terminal for me because i'm a graduate student and i log out of school from there	2783	B
i'm a graduate student in psychology yeah i do uh language acquisition work	2783	B
but it's it's it's very helpful it's nice to have a machine at home that i can use locally for things like writing and so forth but i don't i don't	2783	B
yeah and then i don't need printer or anything-	2783	B
yeah i don't need a printer or anything because i just sort of i can just call school and transfer everything over to school over the phone lines so how about you do you have um a machine-	2783	B
okay i know it	2783	B
yeah P S two's are general architecture	2783	B
they're a little bit different- though um we have two model seventies that we just bought last year and they um	2783	B
there are some slight differences between those and other machines i'm finding oh i feel it's fine i actually don't i i haven't actually noticed a major difference between a P S two and everything else actually	2783	B
um you know in in in terms of performing faster or better or anything i'm not actually sure what the major advantage of a P S two over anything else is with the possible exception of the fact that it's got a mouse port built in the back	2783	B
yeah yeah i think so um it's it's although- although it's funny because i just i just had a discussion on break on one of our machines because it's just too slow	2783	B
we have a decent	2783	B
somehow it slipped by us that we had bought one with two meg and of of memory- of of RAM and one with only one	2783	B
and we're running this new version of Lotus i don't know if you've ever seen this or not	2783	B
yeah oh that's- that's true actually i um i found that this particular version three of Lotus one two three actually i think performs maybe even in the high ninety per cent of what i'm expecting at this point i'm i am	2783	B
it's it's it's because i'm new enough at it yet that i haven't figured everything out	2783	B
my first exposure was	2783	B
i guess when i was an undergraduate um a couple of years ago we had	2783	B
they they inundated us with Macintoshes	2783	B
they brought a bunch of Macs into uh there must have been some sort of program and they brought Macintoshes in for us to	2783	B
for the school to do you know for all the kids in the school to do word processing on and	2783	B
no there there never was an undergraduate requirement it just everyone really everyone took to them very quickly because there were a number of them available and they made	2783	B
uh i'm not sure they must have they didn't in my case i was a psych major and they didn't i know that here they're required of some of of um where i am now	2783	B
they require it of of actually a number of different uh majors	2783	B
you know it's um some psychologists people psychology can take that in lieu of other courses and people in business to uh i think are supposed and people in cognitive science definitely have to um	2783	B
oh yeah i i actually um you said you said you work on mainframes a lot that that's a lot of what i do is on a a Sun i don't know if you work on Suns at all um	2783	B
so Sun Microsystem machine which is another mainframe in a type of a mainframe we do lots of	2783	B
um sort of brain you know neural network modeling	2783	B
on on on a on a lot of mainframe machines so yeah this is been a lot of expanding and having to be able to have things at home and and to study the interaction too has been wonderful	2783	B
wow	2783	B
well no i mean wow they must have been very different back then	2783	B
uh uh wow why why base five	2783	B
God so you've really watched the whole the whole field grow up	2783	B
i mean the the the notion of personal computer back then meant you had to have your own living room	2783	B
wow so this is the perfect topic for you um	2783	B
okay	2783	B
well how do they compare with like um you know the the big um the big you know the the ones that that that took up a whole room in the sixties i mean how would you you know power wise was that less well actually less powerful than	2783	B
oh God really	2783	B
that- that much and and and that much bigger too for the same analogy wow	2783	B
okay	2783	B
oh God okay	2783	B
right	2783	B
that's true	2783	B
that's true	2783	B
right and they'll and they'll say imagine those big clunkers those	2783	B
of big laptop computers way back when	2783	B
does it	2783	B
yeah there's there's	2783	B
going to say there's a big move for that	2783	B
my uh my my sister-in-law is a principal of a school	2783	B
and she just switched but before she was in a um a in a in a a a different school and she wrote a grant with i think it was Apple or IBM one of the two	2783	B
i'm pretty sure it was Apple actually to uh to get a whole bunch of you know PCs into or PC type machines into the school for the kids to use and and it just	2783	B
according to her it's just a wonderful thing kids go in and are able to work at their own pace and you know computers aren't impatient	2783	B
they'll sit there and wait forever if the kid doesn't want to answer for awhile or it'll um	2783	B
it'll you know the kids for those kids who really have a problem working with faster than the class or slower than the class it lets them go and what she's finding now is that in evenings the parents will come in and do it too	2783	B
do you own a PC	2783	A
yeah	2783	A
oh good	2783	A
what are you taking in school	2783	A
hum	2783	A
oh it it's uh ideal for that	2783	A
word processing part is is extremely useful i think	2783	A
uh-huh	2783	A
an an P S E	2783	A
and	2783	A
i've	2783	A
been used to working and this is my first years but all of the work that i do is plus getting to know it a little bit better	2783	A
they're powerful little rascals	2783	A
uh	2783	A
yeah	2783	A
uh-huh	2783	A
yeah i'd i've noticed uh there was some scattered at work and i notice the uh	2783	A
through put is much faster on mine than than those but i think it's just because of the the lower level in expectation out of them that the processing speed is much faster	2783	A
on uh the same canned programs	2783	A
uh-huh	2783	A
yeah	2783	A
or performed to uh	2783	A
eighty percent expectation anyway	2783	A
yeah	2783	A
what was your first exposure to the computer	2783	A
uh-huh	2783	A
right	2783	A
is there an undergraduate requirement on them	2783	A
what about all the majors are there any such as business or uh or other	2783	A
undergraduate majors do they require it of any of them	2783	A
yeah	2783	A
well actually it's expanded your field too because the psychology of of man working with machine is is a whole new element that	2783	A
uh-huh	2783	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2783	A
yeah it's interesting i think uh i've i've worked with computers since nineteen	2783	A
sixty	2783	A
yeah i'm an old man	2783	A
no they were the IBM six fifty took up a whole room as a vacuum tube uh machine	2783	A
and it was binary- quinary um base five	2783	A
i have no idea i didn't never did learn why but it was a base five	2783	A
which is very interesting	2783	A
oh it's been amazing it really has been	2783	A
oh i know it i know it and it's almost like talking about the checkless society and and all of that and you know there was talk	2783	A
in fact my brother uh was with IBM from nineteen fifty four until about three years ago so we really had a family history of talking about	2783	A
development of uh of equipment	2783	A
oh	2783	A
you know and	2783	A
i do i do some programming of my own too using Cobol rather than any of the newer languages	2783	A
it's just one that i've known for a long time and still use it even on this	2783	A
PS two	2783	A
so i have	2783	A
to learn a tolerance with canned programs because i'm so used to being able to do exactly what i want to do rather than having to	2783	A
work around or go through two or three different steps to get to the the final one but i am amazed at the power	2783	A
and uh ability of these small units that sit on a table or desk	2783	A
oh it it was almost uh	2783	A
well	2783	A
it's hard to describe	2783	A
but it's almost like uh an abacus versus an electronic- electronic calculator you know you-	2783	A
you go	2783	A
oh yeah but i mean the speed	2783	A
using punch cards and	2783	A
for your information Ken this first uh first computer had one had two accumulators	2783	A
and one focal point that you had to channel everything into it was called a distributor and you moved it from memory	2783	A
you had to know exactly where in memory it was there was no relative memory	2783	A
and you had to know exactly in memory where it was move it to the distributor	2783	A
put it into one of the accumulators and add it take it back out of the distributor and put it somewhere else so it it was as basic as you can get	2783	A
and uh of course the speed	2783	A
of processing	2783	A
was very very slow but compared to anything then it was very very fast	2783	A
yeah so it everything is relative	2783	A
twenty twenty years from now we'll we'll call up again and and say what do you think of the new uh thought computers	2783	A
right	2783	A
yeah but i think they're they're excellent tools for people to learn how to use and i'd like to see them in in grade schools	2783	A
right now i think they are in fact the	2783	A
computer system uh instruction	2783	A
yeah	2783	A
uh-huh	2783	A
uh-huh	2783	A
yeah	2783	A
oh yeah yeah	2783	A
but it has a lot of home uses too i've i've not i don't have mine hooked up to anything uh	2783	A
you know it's just a stand alone but	2783	A
the abilities in the future will be networking throughout uh automatic built-in telephone	2783	A
do you exercise a lot	2719	A
is mowing the lawn a new form of exercise	2719	A
oh my	2719	A
i think that's considered exercise whether you want it or not	2719	A
well you're you are so far ahead of me i used to uh	2719	A
i used to walk two miles a day and i really enjoyed it	2719	A
because the two miles went fairly quickly i could do it in twenty eight minutes	2719	A
and that's not stopping and talking to everyone along the way but it's a lot you know it's not too strenuous	2719	A
and i could sort all kinds of things out and make plans and everything but i don't know what i did to my knee i	2719	A
was crawling under a desk hooking up a computer	2719	A
and i mashed it wrong or i did something	2719	A
and the doctor has had me on medication and she doesn't want me to walk she said that's you know while it's healing you're going to mess it up so i can't walk	2719	A
and uh she said you know the most conservative approach you do the medicine you do the medicine again and again	2719	A
before you think of surgery and i don't want her to think of surgery on my knee i don't want anyone to think about that	2719	A
ever	2719	A
that's that microscopic stuff you know uh-huh not my kneecap	2719	A
so i'm i'm being very good	2719	A
but i miss it i really do and i	2719	A
oh really	2719	A
uh-huh	2719	A
i can you understand that uh	2719	A
uh i don't really want to i just know i need to	2719	A
you know i make myself do it and if i do it okay i don't love it	2719	A
you know but i will do it	2719	A
uh it's not anything i would want to but i can really tell the difference since i have not been able to walk	2719	A
i have got to be so much more careful with what i do	2719	A
it's depressing	2719	A
right right boy	2719	A
hopefully my my knee is a hundred percent better maybe i can get back into it	2719	A
i have ask you a question off the subject though you're in you're living in the Castle Park area	2719	A
i grew up in Oak Cliff	2719	A
yes uh just	2719	A
close to Methodist Hospital	2719	A
on Candy C A N D Y	2719	A
oh	2719	A
in fact i lived there	2719	A
oh until nineteen	2719	A
late nineteen fifties	2719	A
and that area is it changing back again so many people are moving back into those old houses and are restoring them	2719	A
oh i know exactly where that is	2719	A
yeah sure	2719	A
oh that's	2719	A
that's wonderful that is a gorgeous gorgeous place	2719	A
well sure they are	2719	A
good great	2719	A
oh wow	2719	A
i need to go over there and just drive around and look it's	2719	A
oh i'm sure it must be	2719	A
i'm just we had a lovely little house over there it was like a two story	2719	A
well story and a half really because we had a basement	2719	A
and the guy that built it was weird	2719	A
i mean weird	2719	A
it's one of these really creative houses that i grew up in that nothing was on the same level with anything else	2719	A
and i just loved the neighborhood and i mean everyone everyone had houses like that They were all completely different	2719	A
and so neat	2719	A
uh	2719	A
now why couldn't your wife run around the golf course is that not good	2719	A
oh was he	2719	A
oh	2719	A
yes i i really hear that you know i think you know you're in Oak Cliff	2719	A
but i'm in Plano In west Plano	2719	A
and we live on one of those blocks that it's a neighborhood watch block we all know each other and the street doesn't go anywhere	2719	A
if you are on the street you better belong there	2719	A
because it's not a through street	2719	A
and still i want to get up early in the morning and walk before this knee business and my husband	2719	A
had a lot of heartburn with that	2719	A
i mean	2719	A
it looked darker to him because he he was in the house with the lights on	2719	A
when i was out walking it was more of a pre dawn type pretty	2719	A
but huh-uh he didn't think it looked pre dawn to him it looked dark and even he was real concerned about that so	2719	A
it's not just because you are in Oak Cliff it's just because you're smart that you don't do things like that	2719	A
that's right	2719	A
there's only one crazy out there you know to make any difference	2719	A
um it's uh scaled back considerably uh right now my exercise is pretty much limited to uh softball league and occasional ride on the bike	2719	B
but uh i uh	2719	B
i was just recently well recently nine months ago got married and bought a house so my outside activities have been curtailed somewhat	2719	B
yeah lawn it's a forty year old house so we are doing a lot of refurbish work and uh yeah painting lawn gutters you name it all kinds of stuff flower beds	2719	B
yeah that that's true that's true it's there's always something to do and uh	2719	B
and and uh it keeps me going	2719	B
but	2719	B
uh-huh	2719	B
yeah	2719	B
yeah	2719	B
right	2719	B
uh-huh	2719	B
oh gosh	2719	B
wow	2719	B
uh-huh	2719	B
no that that's yeah that's that's a that's a tough situation	2719	B
uh-huh	2719	B
yeah	2719	B
oh that it's so aggravating to uh to have an injury like that my wife uh	2719	B
runs or likes to run but uh she's well we moved uh we moved down to the north end of Oak Cliff in the Castle Park area	2719	B
yeah and she started running down there and all the hills	2719	B
and she lasted about two weeks and her ankles couldn't take it anymore	2719	B
she was used to running you know flat tracks and whatnot and uh	2719	B
ever since that it's just been real difficult it's real aggravating because she starts in and her ankles will start hurting again and stuff	2719	B
even if she does get on flat ground so she's kind of in the same mode She was all ready to	2719	B
get back into it and start running uh five K's and ten K's and stuff this spring and she just hasn't been able to stick with the training schedule long enough to really get back in shape	2719	B
and when you want to do it it's really really aggravating you know it it's one thing to get motivated to start doing the exercise and it's another thing to to already	2719	B
be past that and then not be able to because of your health	2719	B
yeah	2719	B
well it's	2719	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2719	B
sure	2719	B
yeah yeah uh-huh it is and you know you you	2719	B
you don't well speaking for myself i don't sleep as well when i am not exercising and uh	2719	B
it's really it's harder to get out of bed in the morning and all kinds of stuff it your body just gets used to it and yeah i i don't particularly enjoy	2719	B
well i i used to lift weights an awful lot and stuff like that i do enjoy riding bike but as far as the working out and lifting and things like that	2719	B
uh i i can't say i really enjoyed it all that much but once i got used to it	2719	B
it was habit forming it was i felt so bad if i didn't	2719	B
physically i mean i just my body was was was uh tuned into that that mode	2719	B
and if i if i skipped it then it kind of threw the the whole the whole system out of whack	2719	B
yeah	2719	B
yeah that's for sure	2719	B
okay	2719	B
that's right	2719	B
did you really	2719	B
okay yeah	2719	B
right	2719	B
okay okay	2719	B
yeah it is um we're on we're on a little street called Bison Trail	2719	B
it's only about a block and a half long but it's it's over on the other end It it's over by the far edge of uh Stephen's Park Golf Course	2719	B
yeah it's it's uh you know where the little bridge is on North Oak Cliff Boulevard yeah we are just south of that little bridge back up on the hill in the trees there	2719	B
and yeah um our street is uh an awful lot of retired people but the other half in fact our you know one little block and a half there	2719	B
four houses sold last summer and three sold the summer before and everybody in their	2719	B
late twenties to mid thirties are buying and and starting to rebuild and fix things up again and everybody is real excited	2719	B
yeah and then	2719	B
oh it's it's a lot of fun the people are great there too our uh	2719	B
we've got a real active neighborhood association and uh we have well we've got four regular parties every year and we do a neighborhood recycling program and	2719	B
you know all that kind of stuff so it's a lot of fun and it is it's a really beautiful area	2719	B
and some some of the people um	2719	B
some of the higher dollars lawyers and stuff downtown too are picking up some of those great big houses and they're getting they're getting them at a real bargain	2719	B
you know they're they're getting four thousand square feet for a hundred fifty a hundred and seventy five thousand dollars	2719	B
and uh and they're just going to town with them they're people are putting in pools and	2719	B
and completely redoing the outside restoring to the original you know nineteen thirty nineteen forties look	2719	B
and uh it it's it's really coming around i guess	2719	B
it's it's worth the trip	2719	B
uh-huh	2719	B
okay	2719	B
yeah	2719	B
okay	2719	B
oh wow	2719	B
yeah	2719	B
uh-huh that's right	2719	B
yeah ours ours is kind of a little ranch style with a great big oh i guess it's twenty eight by fifteen front porch and uh next door we've got an Austin stone	2719	B
across the street the guy just uh it was burnt out about two years ago and and the guy moved in and completely redid it and it's got oh it's got a rounded	2719	B
front on it it's all brick and he's he's uh landscaped his yard and he's about ready to put in a pool and things like that so	2719	B
yeah there there's a a variety uh you just don't see it anywhere else as far as the different styles in the houses and whatnot	2719	B
um	2719	B
oh she could a little bit we i tell you what we we we got into the fitness center at Methodist	2719	B
and they have a quarter mile track there	2719	B
so she has started doing that rather than uh rather than take off	2719	B
the problem is she's a school teacher and for her she can't run in the morning For her to get home and try to run at six o'clock in the night in the winter time it's starting to get dark and	2719	B
you know you don't want to she doesn't want to be out by herself anywhere in Dallas regardless whether it's north Dallas or whatnot and	2719	B
when she goes over to this fitness center it's fenced in and there's somebody in the building watching her and all that so it's there's a lot of consideration	2719	B
uh-huh	2719	B
yeah	2719	B
uh-huh	2719	B
right	2719	B
that's right	2719	B
that's right	2719	B
uh-huh	2719	B
yeah	2719	B
right	2719	B
yeah	2719	B
yeah	2719	B
that's right that's right it only takes one time that is it's a hard lesson to learn so	2719	B
uh-huh	2719	B
yeah	2719	B
yeah it's you know it goes all over well it's you know we got this	2719	B
do you have any strong feelings about gun control	2731	A
uh i agree there should be some control but uh how strong of uh a control do you think there ought to be	2731	A
uh	2731	A
okay	2731	A
that's yeah okay got the scale going the other way	2731	A
sure	2731	A
but if you make owning a a gun a crime only criminals will have guns i've heard that before and that's probably true	2731	A
sure uh	2731	A
yeah i agree with that i think that some states are just far too lenient uh Texas and Florida are very easy on uh gun ownership being able to buy guns all it takes is a driver's license	2731	A
and uh sign an affidavit uh saying that you didn't commit any felonies	2731	A
so i think that ought to be uh tightened up i favor uh uh holding uh the guns say for for seven days or whatever until uh you can check out whether somebody is legitimate or not	2731	A
and i think that might stop some of the uh impulsive crimes but uh things that like that are planned uh selling guns to New York City things of that nature i don't think you're ever going to be able to stop that	2731	A
there's just too much of a demand and people are going to get ahold of guns no matter what the restrictions are	2731	A
yeah	2731	A
and a lot of people own guns just as a hobby and uh hunters in particular they're they're not uh buying guns to commit any crimes at all just uh uh pursuing their hobby	2731	A
but it it's uh ones uh say the midnight specials uh uh	2731	A
the semi- semi automatic weapons uh assault rifles things like that that uh really have no place uh for a sportsman	2731	A
uh-huh	2731	A
yeah i don't see any problem with owning a gun for self protection but uh education is is a big part of that people need to be educated on how to uh how to how to store their weapons uh so the kids can't get at them and so they're not a threat to the rest of the family	2731	A
a lot of people don't get that type of education they don't have any kind- type of safeguards on their weapons at home	2731	A
yeah	2731	A
yeah uh gun control legislation is uh is really tough to beat i mean the NRA is so strong and they lobby uh uh a lot in Congress	2731	A
so uh it's going to be really tough to uh add uh gun control type of laws to what we already have	2731	A
sure	2731	A
yeah uh yeah i'll have to agree with that it uh i never really correlated uh those two incidences say crime at home uh versus an international war	2731	A
but uh	2731	A
yeah i guess i don't know how to how to place that	2731	A
yeah uh that's that's true uh and uh when it gets to the point where it's unacceptable where the majority of the people find it unacceptable they may find cause to write their Congressman and lobby for some stronger controls	2731	A
but uh yeah we are very tolerant- a very tolerant society and uh it takes a great deal of uh abuse before we get our act together	2731	A
right	2731	A
uh-huh	2731	A
yeah	2731	A
i think it depends on uh who's leading the crusade and how strong they feel about it take for instance Mothers Against Drunk Driving that used to be just a very small organization started by a housewife	2731	A
and now it's a national organization they they're very powerful uh they collect a lot of money	2731	A
and uh it i think it's made an impact i mean it it's made a lot of people cut down on their their drinking and driving because the laws are enforced stronger now	2731	A
DWI convictions are very serious	2731	A
right	2731	A
because uh they're liable anybody who serves anything to anybody is liable can be sued	2731	A
with guns i think it ought to be the same way	2731	A
i think people who own guns ought to be held responsible for things that happen with those weapons	2731	A
well i saw a talk show just the other night where uh there was a mother on the show and her uh son had been killed in a neighbor's house by one of the neighbor's handguns	2731	A
when only the other kids were at home they apparently had three handguns that were uh in plain sight one on top of the refrigerator one in the on the bedroom dresser and one somewhere else but uh	2731	A
just teenagers and uh and grade school kids at home and one of the kids got shot by a gun got killed	2731	A
and apparently no charges were filed against the owner of the gun who happened to be a police officer	2731	A
so it's i guess they say accidents will happen and uh uh you know it's just hard to say who's at fault for uh things like that that happen	2731	A
but somebody's got to be uh um	2731	A
somebody's got to be held responsible	2731	A
ultimately	2731	A
so i don't know i think the law should be tightened up on on gun ownership but i can't see a total ban on it at all uh	2731	A
because_1 then you're still going to have uh criminals with guns and it's not going to help uh the situation uh there people want to break the law they're going to do it	2731	A
well they have a lot tighter controls on importing things of that nature too you can't get them_1 through airports uh	2731	A
you know like in uh Germany in the airports there where there uh where terrorism is so much of a threat uh the uh policemen have uh automatic weapons	2731	A
you know and uh i don't know what the penalties are for trying to smuggle guns into a country like that but i imagine they're quite severe	2731	A
right	2731	A
well i've heard it said that that's one of the reasons why we're not as much a threat to be attacked by other countries because everybody and his brother's got a gun at home	2731	A
and what are you going to do about that You got two hundred million guns here and	2731	A
it's uh it's more than just an army	2731	A
well there that's your your professional army uh that's your first line of defense	2731	A
uh	2731	A
that that's for your your mercenary forces that go across- overseas and and attack other countries but at at home here	2731	A
i have pretty strong feelings about it yeah i think that guns ought to be controlled	2731	B
well let's see on one to ten i guess i vary i actually started out as a member of the NRA in my youth	2731	B
but having looked at murder statistics in other countries um it's so dramatic that i think that i'm probably down to about a two or a three	2731	B
in terms of control however no i'm sorry maybe up to a nine or a ten	2731	B
um open the almanac one day and it just has murders of by by guns and you look and you look at European countries and and it's like six eleven four and you get to the US and it's four thousand	2731	B
and that tells me something about	2731	B
yeah that	2731	B
that's i mean the other problem is there's so many guns out there if you ban sales of guns right now there'd still be millions and millions and millions of them_1	2731	B
but uh	2731	B
would it would really be nice to make it a little harder to get one so that every punk in the world doesn't doesn't pack a rod	2731	B
yeah	2731	B
right	2731	B
yeah	2731	B
if enough people want it and they're willing to pay for it they'll get it	2731	B
yeah	2731	B
yeah	2731	B
yeah that's certainly true i mean i own a handgun myself i've actually never fired the thing but	2731	B
but um	2731	B
but i went out and bought it intending to to learn to use it and so on but i never did	2731	B
yeah	2731	B
right right	2731	B
yeah i mean i certainly just walked into the store and bought mine and a box of bullets i suppose i could have gone and blown my own brains out or anyone else's who was who was nearby	2731	B
although i must say i have a healthy respect for the thing	2731	B
yeah	2731	B
yeah it's um	2731	B
it sort of amazes me that that in the Gulf War people were really concerned about ten or twenty or thirty or a hundred people dying and if a thousand people died in that war it would have been a mess and if five thousand had died	2731	B
it would have been considered a national calamity and yet that many people die uh from gunshot wounds i mean i think that we have our values in a in a sort of in in a funny place	2731	B
yeah i mean in some in some fields we seem to have this really profound respect for human life	2731	B
and in other fields we don't i think guns and automobiles are the two places where we're willing to take our licks	2731	B
but you know we're willing to accept sixty thousand highway deaths a year	2731	B
yeah	2731	B
yeah in some areas but i think in other areas um	2731	B
i don't know i guess this this this this Gulf War came to mind where where um	2731	B
well war just comes to mind you know couple a hundred people get get blown up and it's and it really shakes the country to it's roots maybe just because of the way it happens	2731	B
and uh	2731	B
but you know we'll go all out uh to save uh a child with a rare disease who makes the newspaper will get millions of dollars in contributions and and all kinds of medical aid because that one life is considered so precious	2731	B
when it's viewed somehow when it's viewed in i don't know as as a single life it becomes very precious and when you view it as a statistic whether it's guns or automobiles or smoking um	2731	B
people just don't see those as individual lives somehow or they don't they don't uh relate to them personally	2731	B
yeah	2731	B
yeah yeah	2731	B
yeah it	2731	B
yeah they are and and it's really changing the social structure of things i know i went out with a bunch of people	2731	B
i don't know six or seven people and we were just sitting around drinking beer and the waitress asked us which one was driving she didn't want to	2731	B
wasn't going to serve that person anything	2731	B
hm yeah i didn't think about that i sort of thought that	2731	B
yeah i thought that was the case i mean if uh if my kid grabs my gun and goes and shoots somebody i would really have the feeling that they're going to come banging on my door	2731	B
huh	2731	B
hum	2731	B
hum i don't know what that says it's pretty sad	2731	B
yeah	2731	B
yeah it's well it's just too late i mean there are countries i've lived in both Japan and England where guns are not available even criminals don't carry them or it's so hard to get and the	2731	B
and the law is so severe for people caught using them that by and large uh they don't	2731	B
yeah	2731	B
yeah	2731	B
yeah	2731	B
no i think by the by the the the year nineteen hundred there were probably enough guns in the US i mean it's just always been a way of life here the wild wild west	2731	B
well yeah that's uh that's a point although uh if that's the case why are we spending all this money on all of this high tech weaponry i wonder	2731	B
yeah	2731	B
right	2731	B
from North Carolina	2714	A
yeah that's coast to coast it's a little little bit earlier there though	2714	A
but we're talking about a national topic anyway	2714	A
yeah	2714	A
that's the truth and i know that we've we've just come off a national high with the Middle East but now we're facing the same old problems that we had before and that is balancing the budget	2714	A
i don't know how California's budget is but North Carolina's state budget is uh disastrous right now too	2714	A
oh my	2714	A
it	2714	A
oh California has always been a leader	2714	A
oh now what was the proposition number several years ago that you voted on for	2714	A
yes	2714	A
right right	2714	A
yeah that that i think was a a smart move i don't know how it's worked out but it it seemed very logical in fact it raises one of the issues that i've thought about the national budget	2714	A
the budget relates to all of us and so does the tax law which usually is an offshoot of the budget process i've often thought	2714	A
that Congress ought not to be allowed to pass any new tax laws say every four or five years instead of every year	2714	A
an individual has no opportunity individual or corporation or any other business entity has no opportunity to plan long range	2714	A
oh yeah	2714	A
to the beginning of	2714	A
right	2714	A
uh that's another thing too i've often often wondered seemed to be when i was growing up i learned in Civics or Government that uh the House of Representatives has to initiate all	2714	A
tax bills	2714	A
and i don't think it's working that way Kathleen	2714	A
no what	2714	A
uh refresh me	2714	A
um-hum oh yeah okay	2714	A
right	2714	A
oh	2714	A
that's exactly the point the business or personal budget either one i've	2714	A
no and when you're not responsible and that's really what it comes down to because you know it a government uh agency really doesn't care about what the postage rate is	2714	A
uh-huh	2714	A
buy something that's right because you you are afraid your allocation will be cut the next year and	2714	A
um-hum	2714	A
and the mentality was and probably rightfully so because the people devising the budget uh didn't go back to a zero based budgeting they just did it on the basis of what they spend five percent increase and uh go on with it	2714	A
uh-huh uh-huh and you know grace uh type waste that you mentioned we see often highlighted in the military and the defense department but it's uh i'm sure it's widespread to every agency	2714	A
um-hum	2714	A
oh yes	2714	A
i'm surprised it's that low Kathleen	2714	A
oh i know i'm surprised the feasibility study could be done for that	2714	A
oh yes	2714	A
yeah that's sad	2714	A
that's sad and people don't realize it we've become sort of blase about the uh amount of money because a billion if if the government paid a dollar a second	2714	A
back in the national debt just a dollar a second it would take thirty years to repay a billion dollars now you know that's that's a long time and that's a lot of money	2714	A
and when we're talking about trillions	2714	A
um have you	2714	A
the uh banking crisis is another another case i was reading this week about the FDIC saying that they couldn't take on another large bank failure without going to government- to Congress	2714	A
and borrowing and i started thinking now wait a minute they're in exactly the same shape	2714	A
uh that they criticized the banks that they're dealing with exactly the same shape but	2714	A
FDIC can't go broke	2714	A
yeah because you and i will pay for it	2714	A
right right have we solved anything Kathleen	2714	A
i i moved here from Oklahoma i'm originally from Virginia and moved to Oklahoma for twenty years and just moved back to the southeast and Oklahoma just passed uh last year	2714	A
a law stating that uh or limiting the terms of the state representatives	2714	A
yeah	2714	A
it will be interesting to see if we have any any impetus to go on to the national	2714	A
yeah i think so too i i get torn thinking about some of the good people all the people i think are good and having to lose them but on the other hand uh maybe they'll pay more serious attention to the process while they're there instead of the reelection	2714	A
nobody does	2714	A
that's right nobody does	2714	A
all right right are you working	2714	A
editor good	2714	A
oh i i would uh love to get into another conversation with you about that	2714	A
oh i i can imagine that that whole process is fascinating to me i think i'd like to observe if not participate sometime	2714	A
um-hum	2714	A
okay where are you calling from	2714	B
i'm in California	2714	B
right it's just uh about- about twelve thirty here	2714	B
that's right and i think that anything we can do to improve the federal budget would be a boon to everybody no matter where they are in the country	2714	B
absolutely	2714	B
well so is ours we have just been told that we're thirteen billion dollars in the red which is more than the entire state budgets of about half a dozen states	2714	B
and they're talking about uh cutting uh aid to the schools particularly the uh university systems	2714	B
and i our local school district is going to have to fire all it's teacher aides to balance the budget so i things are tough all over	2714	B
well i i hope in this case the rest of you will be spared	2714	B
oh prop thirteen is the one that uh	2714	B
limits the amount that uh real estate taxes can rise every year property taxes can only go up a certain	2714	B
amount per year uh until the house is sold or the person dies and then it's reevaluated	2714	B
uh-huh	2714	B
uh-huh	2714	B
well that's certainly true we can get hit uh a lot of corporations at least seem to get blindsided by taxes that are sometimes even retroactive which i would have thought was then unconstitutional but doesn't turn out to be	2714	B
right	2714	B
no it's i don't know where some of these things come from but they look like they're from out in left field to me	2714	B
i don't know what we're going to do long range to solve the budgeting problem but there certainly has been proposals why are are you aware of the Grace Commission proposals from a few years back	2714	B
well the WR Grace uh was put in charge of a commission to find government waste uh i guess this is about eight or ten years ago now and he came out with a whole book	2714	B
of his group i mean it has his name but he was just the administrator of it of places where things like government purchasing could be rationalized where uh	2714	B
renting of space could be made much more efficient where a lot of the accounting is just you know incredibly Byzantine and could be straightened out and where lots of different government activities are redundant	2714	B
and where and there are billions of dollars in every years budget that are just totally wasted because nobody is running the government as if it were a business	2714	B
and	2714	B
uh we we couldn't afford to do that sort of thing we can't we don't have money to throw around personally	2714	B
uh-hum	2714	B
it has no incentive to hold back on expenses uh i happened many years ago to work for a state government for a while and	2714	B
it absolutely boggled my mind the way they budgeted because there was no uh an attempt to figure out what it really should cost to do what we should be doing	2714	B
it was just take last year's budget add X percentage ask for that and if you hadn't spent all your money by December run out and buy something quick so that you	2714	B
that's right i can remember uh the entire office got new electric typewriters because we hadn't spent all our budget money in December that was just crazy	2714	B
that's right	2714	B
we might come up short next year if we haven't spent everything this year and so no matter how foolish the expenditure be sure we get rid of that money	2714	B
absolutely	2714	B
i think uh probably if you just looked at congressional budgets the amount they waste on frivolous things uh with congressional office staff is	2714	B
again mind boggling you read about what it costs the new uh house whip or uh the uh Speaker of the House to redecorate and my God those offices were just redecorated a few years ago	2714	B
they it they spent hundreds of thousands of dollars they're spending twenty five thousand dollars just this year	2714	B
for a feasibility study to determine whether they should build a second gym at the capitol for the staffs of the Congress	2714	B
well that's that's not to build one stick that's just	2714	B
who was it said a a billion here a billion there pretty soon we're talking about real money	2714	B
i think that was old Everett Dirtyson or somebody	2714	B
yes it is	2714	B
and when we're talking about adding that much to a budget where it's just already in the hole just the think about the amount of interest we'll be paying on that we'll probably more than double it	2714	B
um	2714	B
that's right	2714	B
yeah the only difference is the the uh taxpayers that's right	2714	B
uh-huh or our children and grandchildren	2714	B
i doubt it but then i doubt if we ever will just keep writing to your congressman and telling him that-	2714	B
yeah we did that this year too California just passed that in the last election	2714	B
i hope it will	2714	B
i'm	2714	B
well the thing is	2714	B
yeah what's funny is that everybody says they want to throw out the rascals but nobody wants to throw out his own rascal otherwise we wouldn't have ninety eight percent of the incumbents reelected	2714	B
yes i'm an editor at a think tank	2714	B
well it's a fascinating job i get to see all kinds of interesting ideas	2714	B
and i do my small bit to help in uh at least express themselves coherently even if i don't always agree with what they're expressing	2714	B
well we've got some really really interesting people we get fifty different fellows every year from all around the world	2714	B
and uh so we get just the year of intense interaction with these people and sometimes we really hate to see them go we'd like to keep them for years and years and lots of times we're not so	2714	B
okay uh let me see we were supposed to talk about are consumer goods better or worse and have you had to take anything back recently have you	2798	B
oh okay	2798	B
yeah	2798	B
i haven't either i think things must be getting better	2798	B
yeah	2798	B
of course they're probably all Japanese too i'm sorry-	2798	B
i know it i know it	2798	B
and i really would like to buy American but i don't think it's possible i think it- except for maybe in clothes but i think all the electronics are	2798	B
you know basically they're assembled in Japan	2798	B
i do too	2798	B
oh really	2798	B
yeah	2798	B
that's how come i like Wal-Mart you know they try and buy usually all yeah- yeah	2798	B
that's why i prefer if i'm going to shop at a discount place that's where i like to shop is because of that because i realistically we ought to keep stuff at home and	2798	B
but no i don't think i have returned anything in a	2798	B
in a long time uh	2798	B
yeah i do too	2798	B
i don't- i never expect anything to i'm amazed when things last like my refrigerator here ten years you know i'm amazed	2798	B
but it	2798	B
me too	2798	B
yeah right but now days uh getting it fixed is almost as much as going out and buying a new one	2798	B
uh-huh it really	2798	B
i know it they don't keep up with the new technology you know and	2798	B
oh that's the worse	2798	B
uh-huh	2798	B
have you really-	2798	B
i know it and you know i you think you ought to take it back to the dealer because they know them but gosh they're so high they just rip you off	2798	B
i do too i absolutely have to have	2798	B
me too and if they'd only realize that that's what what gets me back to i have quit Ford and Chevrolet both because the dealers were so lousy they gave me lousy service they and uh so i've	2798	B
it wasn't the car well it was the car but i think the car could have been taken care of if a dealer had backed it up but they didn't	2798	B
is it really	2798	B
oh really	2798	B
yeah i've had my car- my car has been in the shop since a week- a week ago Saturday i put it in for a new vinyl top and some hail damage and found out i bummed a ride	2798	B
to work all week- well you know i still had to go to the grocery store and to the bank and you i just have to have a car so i finally ended up renting a car and i- i you know	2798	B
i'm now renting a car i and it may be ready next Tuesday of Wednesday	2798	B
i know it they uh you they don't people don't want to work anymore i i'd what	2798	B
i tried to get uh when i moved i moved up here from Florida and i wanted to get a uh my	2798	B
patio covered because_1 down there we everybody had screened in porches and they're so pretty and they're so reasonable and everything and	2798	B
gosh i can't believe the prices they all quoted me on i said my God no wonder you guys are suffering up here the the prices you're charging for and i finally ended up getting a	2798	B
a steel uh	2798	B
uh top but it wasn't uh uh i wanted an aluminum uh and i wanted it insulated from the heat but this is just steel and then he charged me	2798	B
oh gosh i think eight or nine hundred dollars in Orlando i got the whole thing done screened in the carpeting they insulated the the gutters and everything for fifteen hundred dollars	2798	B
gosh now up here i couldn't even begin to i couldn't begin to afford a room like that up here so i just	2798	B
yeah	2798	B
yeah and boy i bet i have six curling irons up there that have burned up you know that i won't throw away i won't get them_1 fixed either though you know	2798	B
um-hum	2798	B
yeah but	2798	B
um-hum um-hum	2798	B
well i have a Kirby's- an old Kirby i've had for about um ten fifteen years and i i'm like you i've spent eighty six dollars on it last year i keep having it you- just redone and	2798	B
i do too and it's just as good a vacuum cleaner as	2798	B
because_1 those things cost well- well- you know what the price of new Kirby vacuum cleaners are now	2798	B
just the basic without an any of the attachments or anything i think is sixteen hundred dollars i said my gosh it has to come out and clean my house by itself and serve me dinner before i'd pay sixteen hundred dollars and that's without the uh you know i	2798	B
i couldn't believe it	2798	B
they're good and vacuums not that good	2798	B
i just- i had a guy come out and give me uh a demonstration on a new one and i	2798	B
golly of course he made me look like now i keep a real clean house but by the time he got through with me with that new vacuum cleaner made me look like a you know filthy mess you know he was sucking dead uh	2798	B
i know	2798	B
yeah just throw your carpet away well he was sucking uh	2798	B
you know dead skin off of through the mattress you know went from the comforter through the sheet	2798	B
and- and he was showing me all this dead skin that you shed during the night and i said oh my God horrible i know it	2798	B
uh	2798	B
i don't either if i'm shedding then i don't want to know about it as long as i don't can't see i well i let a guy talk me into uh	2798	B
a water softener when i first moved out here a twenty six hundred dollars we i just panicked after well he kind of scared me he just was really uh coming on strong and he just- almost threatening me and he stayed until about ten o'clock at night and course	2798	B
no and i'm not married and i think he and i let- let it out that i wasn't and he was a big old guy and i thought oh God that was stupid i should have told him i had a husband- but i didn't anyway the next day i had this guy that works for me call and tell him that i was cancel- because you had that three day cooling down period here	2798	B
and so i canceled out of it	2798	B
oh	2798	B
and it yeah i don't care if i'm rude i just that's what i do anymore i just i'm not interested and if they call me on the phone i'm not interested just clunk up	2798	B
uh-huh	2798	B
oh okay	2798	B
oh	2798	B
yeah	2798	B
wow yeah	2798	B
oh naturally naturally yeah	2798	B
yeah right it probably- i'll wait and it'll come down to twelve dollars you know about five years well that's good	2798	B
yeah i always hated answering machines -until i got mine	2798	B
i don't either i have it but i don't like it it was given to me and i feel like i have to use and it's come in handy i've had some messages i like but i almost refuse to leave messages and- my daughter i said well i called you and she said well i didn't get a message i said i didn't leave one	2798	B
that's the way of answering machines i thought	2798	B
i don't- i feel dumb talking to a machine for some reason	2798	B
that's right then you know that you	2798	B
see i know yeah you're right you almost	2798	B
but other than that you know i'm lying and i know it	2798	B
i haven't had to take any of those back um	2798	B
i think that's about the last time well that was a gift to me so i guess that's	2798	B
i think we all probably all have all the toys now	2798	B
there aren't any toys out there that we don't need so that's why we haven't bought anything as soon as something new comes out well probably- i- i guess everybody i know has got	2798	B
you know VCR's and answering machines and portable phones and i don't have a car phone but i don't think i hate that i- i get mad when i drive up and somebody's talking on the phone i think they're not driving safely did you know in England that's against the law to drive and talk on telephone	2798	B
and i think it ought to be he	2798	B
let's see yeah i'm always returning things but i have three kids and um a lot of times it's just because it doesn't fit the way that i thought it was going to well that's really clothes isn't it consumer goods	2798	A
trying to think no i haven't returned anything lately	2798	A
well i haven't bought that much really	2798	A
no it's true i think if you're talking about major appliances like stereos and refrigerators and washing machines i mean we've had a lot- all ours for quite a while and	2798	A
it's hard to tell anymore who owns what by the names isn't it	2798	A
yeah	2798	A
yeah	2798	A
i look for that tag i look for that because_1 i well- uh yesterday i bought a curling iron for my daughter and there was two that were the same price and one had a made in America	2798	A
you know tag so i just picked it up i said i'll buy that one yeah i'm trying to be more conscientious about that-	2798	A
yeah that's where i bought it as a matter of fact yeah	2798	A
um um-hum	2798	A
um-hum	2798	A
um-hum	2798	A
yeah yeah but you know i think our expectations- expectations are a lot lower than they used to be	2798	A
you- you know just in general when you buy something you never i mean	2798	A
and- and	2798	A
right	2798	A
yeah- yeah i'm always waiting for something to go on it but and if something does don't you always try to fix it before you ever bring it in because you know you're never going to see it again	2798	A
it's worse the service is worse it really is than buying new because um people just don't know how to fix things now and yeah	2798	A
right and cars that's really bad too	2798	A
we have uh mini van and the door the sliding door on it has never worked right and we've had it back twice to have parts replaced and stuff and they just can't	2798	A
you know i don't i- i don't i think there was just something wrong with the door originally and then- i don't think the service people have the foggiest idea of how to fix it	2798	A
oh they're terrible oh i- i try to avoid the dealer unless you know i think they that's the worst service i've ever gotten anywhere is in a dealer	2798	A
right	2798	A
yeah	2798	A
yep	2798	A
um-hum	2798	A
right but you know we're not from this part of the country and it i've never had uh we're from up north in New England and boy it is uh real different up there with the service	2798	A
really different when- you make an appointment for a certain time during the day so you don't have to always drop it off first thing in the morning and you drop it off and sometimes they run late but never they never keep it	2798	A
i mean i can't say never i just say in my experience they'll say well you know they'll get it if they're done- if they're not going to get it done they will at least tell you down here they just lie to you	2798	A
uh	2798	A
uh-huh	2798	A
uh	2798	A
yep	2798	A
yeah	2798	A
right	2798	A
that's ridiculous that you have to do that	2798	A
see but i just can't understand that i mean i- i because they haven't gotten to it yet probably	2798	A
right	2798	A
i just can't see that	2798	A
um-hum	2798	A
um-hum	2798	A
yeah	2798	A
yeah	2798	A
really	2798	A
yep	2798	A
um-hum	2798	A
um-hum	2798	A
um	2798	A
um-hum	2798	A
no kidding	2798	A
oh my goodness	2798	A
that's something-	2798	A
yeah	2798	A
yeah i'll tell you another thing about um	2798	A
about um appliances too um	2798	A
i'm uh more apt to try and get them_1 fixed now than buy a new one just simply to keep from throwing things away	2798	A
you know that kind of isn't back in with the ecology effort and uh and the and the	2798	A
oh i yeah	2798	A
i know those i mean those things are so cheap but i mean like we have a vacuum that i got when i got married like thirteen years ago and it	2798	A
it was in real bad shape about five years ago and i've had it overhauled for eight eighty dollars i guess and i could have bought a new one for ninety five but it still works	2798	A
yeah	2798	A
yep	2798	A
yeah	2798	A
i think that's better though you know to do	2798	A
right	2798	A
no huh-uh	2798	A
uh-huh	2798	A
oh no	2798	A
but yeah i wouldn't spend that much	2798	A
everything on it	2798	A
no that's wild but- boy but	2798	A
jeez no	2798	A
um-hum	2798	A
um-hum	2798	A
oh no	2798	A
hey listen for sixteen hundred dollars you just save that and put it in the bank you'd get new carpet in a couple of years	2798	A
oh you don't	2798	A
you don't want to- oh yuck that's gross i don't even want to i don't want to know about that	2798	A
uh-huh	2798	A
yeah yeah	2798	A
yeah	2798	A
you couldn't get rid of him	2798	A
um-hum	2798	A
yeah	2798	A
uh-huh	2798	A
good oh good i know that is scary i just don't i won't talk to people i mean i just tell them i am not interested i don't want anything you're selling go away	2798	A
yep yeah	2798	A
you know i just read about here's another thing that you can buy it just read about it in the paper today you can get this attachment for your answering machine	2798	A
and what it is is it's like a little coder box and you tell all the people that you want to talk to like your family and your friends and stuff a three digit code	2798	A
and anybody who doesn't have it has to leave an answering answer on a message on the answering machine so if you get somebody trying to sell you something they can leave their little message but if it's your sister or somebody they can punch in their code	2798	A
course it costs a hundred dollars this year two years from now it'll be fifty i think i'll wait	2798	A
right right yeah that might be come in handy if things keep getting as bad as they do and stuff	2798	A
i do i- i still don't like them_1 i don't like them_1 very much i think yeah	2798	A
yep	2798	A
yeah	2798	A
yeah i know i don't like to leave them_1 that much	2798	A
i know well of course	2798	A
but i- i know i the thing is though when you have an answering machine then you have to call everybody back if you don't have one then they have to call you i just- i just was out this afternoon and i came in and i listened to answering machine and i had a friend that called	2798	A
and not five minutes went by and she called again and she said well didn't you get my message on the machine or do you just not want to talk to me	2798	A
and i was like well i just sat down you know	2798	A
yeah yeah i know	2798	A
yeah they don't believe you	2798	A
no i- i don't know whether um	2798	A
yeah i think we just we haven't bought that much stuff lately but and	2798	A
yep	2798	A
right	2798	A
right	2798	A
that's right	2798	A
yeah	2798	A
yeah	2798	A
oh please my goodness	2798	A
yep	2798	A
wow	2798	A
sounds	2798	A
well yes you have an opportunity to to use a J O B system which is a job opportunity system it's most companies- most big companies have that but	2762	B
well i think sometime that you get lost in that also	2762	B
i really do i i i sometimes think that	2762	B
a small company may offer	2762	B
well i'm not sure how to put-	2762	B
i'm not sure how to put this but that's not	2762	B
uh perhaps better one on one uh relations a a big company sometime you can get lost you can you can uh opportunities do arise	2762	B
but the competition is much greater for that	2762	B
opportunity okay	2762	B
exactly i and i think you get a lot more support from your coworkers and and often times in a big company you are asked to go and do things in other areas that	2762	B
may not be your expertise okay but they require you to do this as their as your uh stepping stone or whatever you'd care to call it	2762	B
and and that can get to be sometimes very very disastrous with- the consequences of that because people do the best they can	2762	B
and often times it's not really what	2762	B
was aimed at in the first place if that makes sense	2762	B
yes i can i see that in my job because my particular job is of of a troubleshooting nature and i'm you know it's one of these put out fires things so	2762	B
i can see the results of that	2762	B
but um	2762	B
yes i i'm i i get a lot of gratification from my job but- some some folks i guess they go to work every day and they just go to work for a paycheck every every two weeks or every month or whatever	2762	B
but in my particular job i really enjoy it because i do have an opportunity to help other people do better okay and i really like that	2762	B
yes-	2762	B
yeah i i i also teach school at at TI at uh Texas Instruments i'm a i'm an instructor there so	2762	B
i teach new	2762	B
well not new employees but all yeah- all employee any employees really that that care to and we talked about the job opportunity system we have uh a system where we train people to- to become what we call automation specialists	2762	B
and and it's a job where if you as a secretary you decide you want to be uh an automation specialist which is a much higher paying job and a much more technical job	2762	B
and then you would come to one of our in-house classes	2762	B
on on company time	2762	B
and and and or on overtime so we don't involve the the uh production process okay of of personnel coming to our classes and we set up and establish these	2762	B
sixteen and twenty week classes at at uh three hours a day twice a week	2762	B
for automation specialist training	2762	B
when you finish hopefully you've acquired enough knowledge to uh	2762	B
you know move on into advanced machinery type operations and	2762	B
and and that that's really gratifying to me i	2762	B
i see a lot of young folks come in and and gals and guys both and some gals that say i've no- i don't know a hammer from a	2762	B
coming in and and top notch uh	2762	B
mechanical type people and they want to do better so they of come- they they jump right on it	2762	B
no that's a fact and	2762	B
and train and train them we sometimes we have to uh simply for for two reasons one	2762	B
that we we are changing jobs constantly where we are changing our methods of doing things and we are finding more economical methods and more	2762	B
okay and the other thing is we cannot find the people outside to just walk in off the street and help us	2762	B
so	2762	B
but that would be the same in your type of secretarial job i'm that one time we the girls used to have just the typewriter and they	2762	B
and then they had word processors and now they've got full blown desk top publishers so you know	2762	B
it is i i'm that amazes me that- you know people say your job amazes me well my job is really nothing i sit there and i watch some little gal make me all kinds of charts and view foils and graphs and	2762	B
and it's i it's you know they use laser printers and all that and it's absolutely mind boggling uh because i could probably turn it on before i get the screen to go completely blank you know and i generally do that	2762	B
but i i was in the same situation i had to learn	2762	B
i i had no knowledge of a computer at all i'm a master	2762	B
mechanic but not a computer expert	2762	B
but now i'm in to Lotus and word processing and i can hold my own with that	2762	B
but um	2762	B
uh-huh	2762	B
yeah	2762	B
yeah i i i feel that way and it's a long time to get you know you work for many years with two weeks vacation per year	2762	B
and then if you have extra days out for	2762	B
what other reasons uh there may be uh an and we we try to deal on an individual basis with them but you can be penalized for that an and it it's penalized against your merit increases and et cetera	2762	B
so i mean you are allowed a certain number of days of- what we call sick time and personal time off but if you you know if you extend beyond those	2762	B
an and at times we will adjust on a one to one basis	2762	B
for some unusual circumstances but	2762	B
to work for a company almost fifteen years with two weeks vacation it seems to me like an awful long time	2762	B
well no it well in some instances yes	2762	B
okay in some instances it would be we start with a a weeks vacation and then it's two weeks after a year or so	2762	B
but then that two weeks stays and then it goes to three weeks for a long long time and then after fifteen years it's four weeks	2762	B
but that's still that's a long time you know	2762	B
oh sure	2762	B
i think uh i would like to see	2762	B
i would like to see more	2762	B
well	2762	B
it's like the kids were talking in California about going to school all year but they have breaks every ninety days or thirty days or ninety days or whatever it is they have two weeks off or a week off or something-	2762	B
and they find that that's much	2762	B
better for them than having the whole summer off an where they're completely bored like the second month into i think i think industry really- would really	2762	B
benefit from that	2762	B
i'm not sure how we would accommodate all of our people being on vacation at all various times but we would always be shorthanded i guess but so that's a problem you know that's a problem pardon me	2762	B
well yes that's and that's exactly what we do in many instances you know where our work load increases an and our vacation periods and stuff	2762	B
of course we have uh what we called an SDS a Summer Development Student Program so	2762	B
we we put a lot of school um	2762	B
college	2762	B
pardon me	2762	B
yeah	2762	B
yeah they work for us and and they they go to school back in the Fall	2762	B
and hopefully when they get out of college they consider us to come on full-time	2762	B
and they've uh established themselves with a work pattern an and the you know they're familiar to our	2762	B
our ways and stuff and they're on our records and	2762	B
we find that that's very very helpful	2762	B
you sound uh like a very young person	2762	B
i	2762	B
um you know one thing that i miss being in a small company is the opportunity for um	2762	A
job growth just different job opportunity i was talking with somebody from Bausch and Lomb today and she was telling me how she started as a clerk typist and then found another opening in another department and	2762	A
moved on and so forth and so forth and is now uh personnel uh director	2762	A
and i mean it's just it's there's so much opportunity in a larger company to uh stay within the same company so you're not losing your seniority level but um	2762	A
just to try new things and and see new areas and departments and i mean you can in in a large company you can go from one department to another department as if if you switched companies sometimes	2762	A
um-hum	2762	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2762	A
well uh-huh	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
uh-huh well it's true yeah	2762	A
there is a very uh uh at least in my office and i know that's not necessarily the way it is all over but the camaraderie within the office	2762	A
when you're with a small company i think you're right you could be even uh you can be a big person in a small company you know	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
uh-huh sure	2762	A
right	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
i yeah i understand that you know a question that i have for you is um do you feel working- working in a large company do you feel that you can see the impact that you make	2762	A
do you feel that you can see like the results i know in my company each person is vital because we are the company and each person really can see the results that they produce	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
oh	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
i see yeah	2762	A
yeah	2762	A
i i	2762	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2762	A
uh-huh i i do feel bad for the people i mean obviously we all work for a paycheck but it's nice if you can be enjoying it you know while you're doing it	2762	A
oh	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
that is great	2762	A
oh really	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
that is wonderful	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
uh-huh well	2762	A
yeah	2762	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2762	A
that is great and that is so smart because with uh everything becoming so much more technical and sophisticated	2762	A
you're just not finding people out in the work force that have the skills that you necessarily need	2762	A
i mean- you just don't find them and it- it's such- such a great way take the people that you already have and train them	2762	A
yeah	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
right	2762	A
uh-huh exactly	2762	A
oh my	2762	A
oh exactly i mean it's incredible	2762	A
um	2762	A
yeah	2762	A
yeah	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
wow	2762	A
yeah	2762	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2762	A
right	2762	A
right	2762	A
oh that's great	2762	A
that is fabulous	2762	A
you know another benefit that that i wish i had more of and who wouldn't is vacation time	2762	A
you know um	2762	A
i think that uh when- when you're working and an especially i don't know i mean every job you you say how you're constantly putting out fires	2762	A
you know i i feel like my job is like that too unfortunately but that just it drains you you know after a while it just-	2762	A
yeah yeah exactly right	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
oh	2762	A
oh wow	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
right uh-huh	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
it's hard	2762	A
is that uh what your company policy is too	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
oh my goodness	2762	A
but that is a long time and especially when you take a weeks vacation	2762	A
i was just talking to somebody about this today it's funny it takes you until Tuesday or Wednesday to really wind down	2762	A
you know to say okay i i can relax i can sit here for an hour if i want to and just not do anything and realize that you don't have to be worrying about something you know	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
right	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
that's true	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
yeah well that's where temporaries come in	2762	A
they could hire temporaries to fill in	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
oh	2762	A
like a co-op type thing for the summer	2762	A
like a co-op for the summer almost-	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
uh-huh	2762	A
right	2762	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2762	A
right	2762	A
yeah i- that is and uh it also gives you a chance you know to look at these kids and make your own determinations	2762	A
i'm twenty five	2762	A
sure i used to cycle around the block two or	2730	A
yeah i recycled once before no yes actually we do we have Berkeley is a very avant-garde recycling city	2730	A
yeah they they go around and they give you these boxes and you you fill these boxes up and you take them_1 out and they leave you know	2730	A
uh you leave them on the curbstone and every Thursday or some such day they come by and pick them up problem is you end up with these boxes in your home that	2730	A
you know get pretty piled up with such things as glass and tin cans and newspapers and and and by the time you you manage to drag one downstairs you know it's	2730	A
it's work i- i- i just the- the- there there's got to be a better way of incorporating it you know somehow so that the manufacturers uh	2730	A
uh that there's an incentive to get it back to them	2730	A
exactly you know what- what they uh oh another thing is that it the- industry has got to get the mind set that what they'd do affects the universe- you know the- affects the environment	2730	A
what they manufacture has got to be and the way it's packaged has got to take that into consideration	2730	A
but like here in Berkeley you can't buy anything from a fast-food place anything like that that's in styrofoam	2730	A
uh and you know it's it's supposedly decomposes i've heard some stories though about	2730	A
that uh the thing that that lasts longest in in in a in a the the uh landfills	2730	A
is not so much the diapers and the things that everyone's yelling about but it's the newspapers	2730	A
yeah and that's really strange you wouldn't think that but whenever you see you know they're usually uh wrapped real tight and bundled and under pressure themselves before they get put into the landfill so	2730	A
inner areas of them are are protected	2730	A
so they don't decompose	2730	A
isn't that you know you	2730	A
and all those thousands of trees that gets cut down and you think well geez well newspaper's pretty good because it will you know	2730	A
indeed well you know there's got to be a fortune in that you know i've got all we've got to do is get together and figure out some way to to use these diapers in some useful product you know some some some	2730	A
well yeah yeah	2730	A
or or or or a compost brick uh you know	2730	A
you know build your next sky rise out of compost brick you know you'd see the little blue things flickering through it but	2730	A
i think that might give it a little added	2730	A
touch of something i'm not sure what	2730	A
no but that so they're aware of it in Texas huh	2730	A
that makes my heart sore because the last time i was in Texas	2730	A
was on a hunting trip and i was there with a couple of buddies and we had filled up a couple of cans we're going down the road about eighty miles an hour and rolled down the window and just threw them out now	2730	A
uh i- i will have to say that the people i was there with were Texans	2730	A
i was visiting it was not my idea	2730	A
well i- i understand that and i think that that that he's certainly contributed to that	2730	A
i want you to know you've taken a big load off my chest i've never been able to to confess that to anyone and now i've gotten to confess it	2730	A
well something's got to be done i tell you what i was just watching a a show the other night on on Antarctica uh	2730	A
and how they're wanting to make it a a uh	2730	A
an international park zone so that no one country you know gets down there and trashes it for mining rights or any other thing and um uh	2730	A
it just it just amazes me uh you know that that that there's so little left on this earth where there is that sort of thing and of course the only reason that that place is left is because the damn	2730	A
climate is so inhospitable that no one can live down there you know	2730	A
yeah well they're they're doing it they you know they're they're learning and and it's inevitably doomed and speck- you know all they got to do is find one speck of platinum or one speck of gold or uranium and and	2730	A
well they not uh not absolutely for sure now there is some off offshore	2730	A
but as far as on the continent i don't think that anyone drilled a rig on the continent yet	2730	A
but uh in any event	2730	A
i think we all just sort of have to hunker down and do something about it but you know it's like we we we have all the needs that you know a civilized society has and i think that it's not	2730	A
all our responsibility to to do that i mean the- the the manufacturers would- would manufacture things in ways that were biodegradable and did not	2730	A
damage the the the environment you know i think that it would be a plus for them and more people would buy more of those products	2730	A
yeah and i think that the people are ready to pay a little extra for that kind of marketing	2730	A
yeah	2730	A
yeah well i- i know i'm willing i just uh you know it's just i- i have certain needs for certain things and uh you know i really can't help it how it is packaged	2730	A
i have the need for what's there	2730	A
found ways and i will switch immediately and i think probably the rest of the planet will too	2730	A
well listen it's been a pleasure talking with you Steve right	2730	A
alright well you take care and listen uh the next time you run over a beer can in the road	2730	A
please do	2730	A
alright bye	2730	A
okay well do you have any formal programs in your area	2730	B
oh no	2730	B
somehow that doesn't surprise me	2730	B
yeah	2730	B
yeah what i- i don't know we we there are some beginnings of formal programs where we are though they're not in our town i mean Jackie and i uh recycle cans you know we just we just	2730	B
fill up a we have a trash can set aside for aluminium cans and when it gets full we just take it down and drop it off at the recycling center but that's about the extent of ours	2730	B
uh i don't it seems to me like if if they really wanted to get serious or you know the government and uh the other private industries that could benefit from it would make uh perhaps more permanent	2730	B
uh exterior fixtures which you know wouldn't be hassle to drive to or carry stuff to you know that that's kind of one of the thoughts that i had about it	2730	B
um-hum	2730	B
yeah	2730	B
yeah they've switched to that paperboard the pressboard stuff	2730	B
is that right	2730	B
yeah	2730	B
isn't that something	2730	B
yeah i saw a sign at the local Wal-Mart here back there in the baby section talking about Wal-Mart does not buy disposable diapers	2730	B
because_1 they don't decompose as rapidly as people say they do so they just buy the ones that don't decompose at all i thought that was interesting	2730	B
huh like like compost	2730	B
yeah	2730	B
oh	2730	B
they are yeah they're uh like i said we've we've just recently i guess in our part we're like right in the middle of the state and you know we're not more in some of the metropolitan areas like Dallas or Houston or something but that you you are starting to see more	2730	B
big large uh recycling like dumpsters where	2730	B
oh no you messed with Texas	2730	B
uh-huh	2730	B
well you know they've got these adopt a highway programs they have to give the convicts something to do you know	2730	B
yeah i'm gonna say i don't typically	2730	B
well i'm i'm happy to oblige not happy that you did it but you know	2730	B
yeah	2730	B
right right yeah well of course they're they're trying real hard to devise ways to sustain life more comfortably down there just so they can get at some of those resources	2730	B
yeah	2730	B
well there's already oil there isn't there	2730	B
um-hum	2730	B
yeah	2730	B
huh	2730	B
oh boy there there's such a higher level of consciousness about that now that's that's got to be i mean if you could come up with something like that just to the the marketing advantage would be phenomenal	2730	B
yeah i well i think we've already seen that i mean just in the the this the few products that have uh plugged that is a is an advantage you know it costs more and people have jumped on them_1	2730	B
yeah right right and then as soon as something comes along that is that that you need and all of a sudden it's available and in a environmentally	2730	B
conscious package	2730	B
i- i tend to agree and it sure would be nice to see something like that	2730	B
yeah that's right i sure enjoyed it	2730	B
i'll think of you okay bye-bye	2730	B
yeah i think um this is a tough subject because uh when you come from two different parts of the country uh the political views are really different	2780	A
i uh i i guess i've had to discuss a number of what might be considered controversial issues	2780	A
i guess like i like and though nothing i guess nothing is as- as awful as abortion but like gun control	2780	A
and uh day care and things like that and there are some very different views uh of the people connected with the program which i thought was really interesting you know	2780	A
well-	2780	A
yeah well being in- in in Baltimore see Maryland is um is sort a um is probably- liberalism- is a is a hub of liberalism you know compared to the country uh you know very um	2780	A
in in many ways uh very liberal very similar to New England though Pennsylvania and New York uh i aren't actually as liberal Maryland is a very liberal uh	2780	A
state so so where- where here we have um we have gun control laws we probably have some of the strictest gun controls laws in the nation and most people in Maryland vote for that	2780	A
you know so it really is a different um	2780	A
yeah that's that's true i talked to a i had to talk about gun control with somebody and i talked with a woman who actually	2780	A
you know had- had- had just purchased a gun that day and was going target shooting you know and it was very different it was a whole different view it's really um	2780	A
this has opened my eyes to thinking you know at one time i just sat here and thought well how can anybody believe that because i'd really never met people that did	2780	A
and now i talk to people that do so that's it's really interesting	2780	A
um-hum	2780	A
um-hum	2780	A
yeah	2780	A
yeah isn't it funny	2780	A
um-hum	2780	A
hm	2780	A
yeah	2780	A
yeah well you can possess them_1 here too but they have to be they're registered and uh like the the the Brady Bill that's currently being discussed nationally and whatever is very well supported here in gun control avenues and um	2780	A
you have the seven day waiting period	2780	A
yeah that's uh that's	2780	A
yeah	2780	A
yeah that's true that's very true that's and that's the way most- i guess most of the um	2780	A
the political organizations work you know the same i know the abortion issue with right to life and right to choose and	2780	A
and both of them are uh both want the extent of extremes so that they don't give anything for a balance you know there's there's always that difficulty	2780	A
um i would say i'm probably liberal yeah	2780	A
yeah	2780	A
sure	2780	A
well i'll tell you	2780	A
i i think you know if they if they didn't give as much coverage to these idiots that burn the flag	2780	A
it would never happen do you know what i mean	2780	A
it's only because they make a big stink over it but i i guess actually i believe that if somebody wants to burn the flag i guess that's their opportunity their their their right in the sense of freedom of speech but i- i would never	2780	A
yeah	2780	A
yeah	2780	A
well it's freedom- that they i think the idea of freedom of speech goes back to and i uh uh the the the whole aspect of being able to display your	2780	A
uh	2780	A
your ideas you know the what the country stands on America stands on is that they can do that	2780	A
uh though i would never even consider it in a million years to do it myself i i i think uh	2780	A
you know but i i still what the stands- flag stands for i guess to me is that if somebody wants to voice their opinion or display their opinion openly and if that is a a way that they can show their opinion then they should be allowed	2780	A
uh	2780	A
unless the burning- unless the actual fire hinders somebody's health and well-being you know but i i think that's i guess that's i think- that's my opinion yeah i guess you feel differently	2780	A
uh no but i think that's that's the it's that's taxpayer's money if somebody buys their own flag and and burns it that's fine but that that's you know that's destruction and of- of uh	2780	A
public property and whatever	2780	A
no i don't know i guess the symbolism oh i think what America stands for is the right to be able to disagree with the government	2780	A
uh i think that's what's made democracy	2780	A
yeah	2780	A
um-hum yeah	2780	A
well that's that's true yeah but i think i i guess-	2780	A
yeah i i guess- i guess the idea you know they always keep saying like the framers um there uh of one of the Republican the appointees for the judicial- the judicial bench	2780	A
and they always talk about that they they feel that this person believes in the framing of the constitution what the original framers the ideals the original framers set down and um	2780	A
i believe that the idea of burning the flag is is in my understanding of how it was framed is that you this country- the thing about this country is that you can disagree with its government and you can display that	2780	A
uh i guess- yeah i guess and and so that as a freedom of expression and speech and whatever i- i think that that's viable um	2780	A
as long as it's your flag and and you've made your your point i think yeah yeah because realistically like for you for you you don't think it's right	2780	A
and i would never do it i i love this country too much and that symbol means a lot to me	2780	A
um but i guess it's just one of those things where if they if that's what's something if a need for them	2780	A
you know	2780	A
yeah yes	2780	A
no	2780	A
right	2780	A
yeah um-hum	2780	A
um-hum	2780	A
yeah	2780	A
i agree there too i agree with you there too i i the um	2780	A
i i it's i find it you know personally disgusting but i don't think that i don't think that uh	2780	A
we have a right to stop somebody from that you know the same i don't know i guess i get i get all all mixed up inside when	2780	A
yeah it gets- when it's uh it's an emotional issue and you sit and you try and think about it logically and and and you know you try to say to yourself now emotionally this is a disgusting thing uh but logically	2780	A
um even you know for instance the pro-life pro-choice movement uh you know i don't know anybody that actually supports abortion	2780	A
but they would vote pro-choice	2780	A
because you know that's just a disgusting thing you know somebody an abortion means it's somebody's in trouble and that it's an awful thing	2780	A
you know but	2780	A
yeah	2780	A
but it that's uh that's what i mean see most- but but realistically when you think of it it just sounds like such an awful thing and it evokes an emotional response i think that's the hardest thing i don't know if i could ever be a judge	2780	A
because some things emotionally just aren't you know	2780	A
no no i think the um	2780	A
sometimes i guess what did i read recently the um the the uh Christian	2780	A
uh point is- is always the point of well it's at conception	2780	A
but then um a friend of mine's a doctor and argues with others that conception is a biblical term and there's no concept of conception in medicine or biology	2780	A
so then that so that throws out that idea it makes it a religious discussion then so it's- i don't know it's very it's it's uh you know it's a it's a topsy turvy world and it's really something how	2780	A
um political ideas and viewpoints within one country can vary so much and also within um	2780	A
within a	2780	A
yeah and how yeah how it'll sway from one extreme- one extreme to another	2780	A
uh i think that uh	2780	A
you know i i just read something i think in Time magazine uh about- about um protest on	2780	A
uh-huh	2780	B
well now you say- you say two different parts of the country what are are you- are you referring to yourself are you	2780	B
uh-huh	2780	B
um-hum	2780	B
uh well of course uh you talk gun controls down here in Texas and you're asking to be lynched	2780	B
hm um-hum	2780	B
well it's very true now i'm a a New Yorker by birth	2780	B
although i claim Florida as my home now	2780	B
uh i have two sons living down there but	2780	B
but i also have two sons living elsewhere one in Tennessee one in Mississippi but i lived in Tennessee- in Florida for ten years and i kind of like it down there but they had a gun control law which went a little bit too far	2780	B
i think uh well in your words they were a little bit too liberal	2780	B
i mean they permitted- they i believe if i'm correct i believe they permitted to carrying concealed weapons	2780	B
but they uh quickly did away with it i think in the next session they they uh modified it	2780	B
but it's still legal to own or possess weapons in uh uh Florida	2780	B
the the the one week uh uh seven day delay	2780	B
uh-huh	2780	B
well i don't mind that too much now i'm i'm with the NRA myself and uh uh really the only the objection we have	2780	B
is uh you you give a little and next thing you know uh somebody's- somebody's trying to take more	2780	B
yeah	2780	B
well then- tell me do you consider yourself a liberal	2780	B
well let me ask you this then how is your what is your feeling	2780	B
about uh uh expressing yourself by burning the American flag	2780	B
um	2780	B
well now wait a minute there there you just said it	2780	B
it's their right by freedom- freedom of speech what does speech have to do with burning a flag	2780	B
now uh well i i still go back to	2780	B
then would you condone the burning of the capitol building	2780	B
uh then you don't draw a line between public property and uh uh uh	2780	B
what a public uh	2780	B
symbol	2780	B
uh yeah but here again i go back to the second amendment you can disagree by speech- freedom of speech	2780	B
which has nothing to do with action	2780	B
now i am i am adamantly against that	2780	B
um-hum	2780	B
yeah um-hum	2780	B
no	2780	B
um-hum	2780	B
well here again we uh even though you uh	2780	B
physically you agree with me you you wouldn't do it yourself	2780	B
but nevertheless you maintain that it's it is the right of of any citizen to burn the symbol of their country	2780	B
uh	2780	B
um so long as it's their possession okay you're you're that's fine up to there except that uh the what that flag symbolizes is uh uh is this country	2780	B
and i used to know as a Boy Scout but all i remember was the red in the flag represented blood that- that was shed to to create this country and to maintain it	2780	B
and to me that's	2780	B
uh uh a a black eye to every man that ever uh carried a weapon or killed for his country	2780	B
hm um-hum	2780	B
it's very easy to do	2780	B
um-hum	2780	B
well i think it should be permitted under certain circumstances- circumstances	2780	B
um-hum	2780	B
well tell me has it ever been decided when when is a uh fetus a human	2780	B
hm	2780	B
or they on their own- within the own uh society it can vary	2780	B
um-hum	2780	B
well i- i do about the same i guess but in a different fashion i- i- i'm from New York originally and now that i live in Florida i live in the Florida in the winter and then go back up north in the in the summertime	2910	A
and i i feel that the the only legitimate paper although it might sound a little elitist is the New York Times i've always read the New York Times when i was younger and i try to find- now that it has a national edition i read that i also read uh	2910	A
i- i- i guess i do watch uh McNeil Lehrer on P B S because i- i lean to that coverage and and i've i guess i'm	2910	A
yeah well yeah that's a whole hour show actually it's an hour show each evening and and uh we we turn it on when we start dinner we seem to start dinner around six and finish it up	2910	A
i find that i'm leaning on uh i travel a great deal uh even overseas and i find that i lean on uh C N N quite a bit for concise and quick stuff and i'm	2910	A
i'm i- i'm quite satisfied with the way they put it out i mean i i don't believe everything they say but it it's it's coverage you know	2910	A
yeah	2910	A
yeah	2910	A
uh	2910	A
well yeah i- i- i uh Peter Arnett was reporting direct from uh Iraq i think this is scandalous the way everybody's picking on him i- i think that what he he reported what he saw and if you didn't like it that was just too bad you know	2910	A
yeah oh yeah i mean i	2910	A
no	2910	A
that that's right i think so and and i guess if it comes to um to magazines i don't read i used to when i was younger i subscribed to Time and U S News and World Report i- i have seemed to	2910	A
slide away from that and rely more on the local paper or	2910	A
i- i- i also subscribe to something called World Press which is uh a magazine that only talks about other uh excerpts from the world press which sort of gives you a different slant than it's not	2910	A
as slanted as the New York Times or as biased perhaps as a local paper	2910	A
but uh that i guess and the radio uh i listen to P B S radio a lot and i also listen to uh uh these twenty four hour news stations when i'm driving i	2910	A
yeah	2910	A
do you read uh are you from southern or northern California	2910	A
so- so well	2910	A
yeah is that what what is that the San Francisco paper out there is uh the major paper	2910	A
yeah that's a terrible paper	2910	A
is that pretty good	2910	A
oh the what is that the Chronicle isn't it	2910	A
oh	2910	A
oh yeah they just- they really are the uh probably the worse papers i've ever read i	2910	A
yeah well can you get the L A paper up there that's a pretty decent paper isn't it or	2910	A
yeah	2910	A
yeah	2910	A
yeah uh i think i- i agree with you that the problem seems to be they don't have enough time to do all the stuff uh i feel pretty well versed in in what i'm doing because i- i do spend more time on that than i do say on sports or	2910	A
although i watch that i spend a lot of time reading about these things i'm quite interested i find it very exciting to for the coverage we have now today	2910	A
the	2910	A
if anything they i think they listen	2910	A
uh well i don't know i- i hear a lot of criticism about listening to these to the Dan Rathers of the world and and listening- and and taking their word for it or their comment actually they i think they slant things but	2910	A
no kidding oh well i didn't know that yeah	2910	A
yeah	2910	A
yeah was- was- was he	2910	A
yeah	2910	A
well how do you feel about it i guess i i got to say if that's the subject if the subject is do i feel that we're well enough equipped to i don't know if if it said that i feel i'm well enough equipped	2910	A
yeah to yeah	2910	A
yeah i think i do too i think you have to let uh you you got to segregate some of it	2910	A
well that's about all i have to say	2910	A
nice talking to you bye bye	2910	A
i think i get most of my news uh in headlines from the radio and then i follow up by reading the newspaper and news magazines about things that attract my attention	2910	B
um-hum	2910	B
uh-huh	2910	B
i like them but they take so long i don't always have time	2910	B
uh-huh	2910	B
yeah i think C N N does a pretty good job i had not watched them very much except when i was abroad until the Gulf War	2910	B
and they seemed to have the best coverage they had more information sooner than most of the other networks	2910	B
yeah	2910	B
yeah	2910	B
well uh i know that the coverage he was allowed to present was slanted but i think they said that frequently enough that you shouldn't criticize the man for giving us one perspective uh	2910	B
um-hum	2910	B
yeah	2910	B
yeah we have a C B S twenty four hour station that i listen to on the way to and from work and	2910	B
northern i'm from uh the peninsula Palo Alto	2910	B
well it's horrible The San Francisco paper is just wretched	2910	B
so i subscribe to the San Jose Mercury News um uh Palo Alto is about midway between well it's a whole lot better than that San Francisco paper and	2910	B
yeah there's the Chronicle and the Examiner but they're uh both uh run by the same people-	2910	B
they're just horrid so we read the	2910	B
uh we can but i don't like it so we subscribe to the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal and the Mercury News	2910	B
yes well again i read that uh two columns on the front	2910	B
um-hum	2910	B
yes and i think we do get pretty good coverage i don't feel that the American people is being shortchanged by the uh the news coverage	2910	B
we almost have too much	2910	B
well i cannot stand Dan Rather i remember him when he was a local newscaster in Houston and i hated him then	2910	B
and i would not watch that man for money and he and Barbara Walters just really turn my stomach so	2910	B
uh i watch Peter Jennings and uh and Tom Brokaw sort of alternate	2910	B
do we get enough news or something like that do we get uh the- the do we get the news that we want and i do i really think	2910	B
yeah	2910	B
okay well nice to talk to you bye bye	2910	B
okay um do you have any advice for college i'm i'm i'm full of advice i'm still a graduate student so	2942	A
oh	2942	A
hum	2942	A
yeah	2942	A
hm	2942	A
oh that's interesting	2942	A
i went to a a liberal arts school actually at first and you weren't really even um	2942	A
they didn't expect you to choose any sort of major or anything at all until you were	2942	A
in your second year and then you you know you had i think you had to pick it by the by the by the end of second you had to pick some sort of major but until then they didn't sort of force you they they sort of forced you to run around taking classes in everything until then	2942	A
certain requirements so that so that you had to sort of get a general feel for everything	2942	A
so it wasn't that specialized so that	2942	A
yeah	2942	A
yes	2942	A
um-hum i was just on a committee recently actually sponsored by uh the American Association for the Advancement of Science trying to sort of you know where where they were just trying to figure out how to fit science and liberal arts together you know	2942	A
because_1 there are people who are getting just wonderful science educations and not getting enough liberal arts and then the other way around as well people are getting just pure technical science educations and not getting very good liberal arts sorts of issues so	2942	A
um-hum	2942	A
well that must be helpful	2942	A
that could be very helpful-	2942	A
yeah well i figure that that that that's probably the thing that i would most tell any parent you know to tell- to tell their kids i think probably make sure the kid goes to a school where they can get sort of a general education and	2942	A
save specialization i guess for graduate school unless they're sure they want early on they want to do something like engineering or something or they can	2942	A
hum	2942	A
yeah but that's- that's a good idea well where i am right now actually i'm at the University of Rochester	2942	A
and that's a pretty good engineering school i think i think we do some they have a pretty good engineering here they also have a program- a fairly large liberal arts college as well a sort of a separate- a separate you know college- uh arts- arts and sciences college um	2942	A
and i believe the engineers are sort of required to take classes in in- in everything and i know people i do uh i do work in language processing and and and at least one person who's in my field started off as an engineer	2942	A
started off as an electrical- electrical- an electrical engineer student and then switched over at some point into language processing because he found that he enjoyed it more so they do force them people are forced to sort of take all different kinds of classes here which i think is wonderful	2942	A
right	2942	A
um-hum	2942	A
yes	2942	A
um-hum	2942	A
hum	2942	A
um um-hum	2942	A
that would be very good actually	2942	A
right you you don't need any philosophy at all in school	2942	A
um-hum	2942	A
or some- yeah or or or or some other thought provoking area you know very true we had uh when i went to undergraduate we had uh um	2942	A
went to Brandeis don't know if you know of it or not um we had uh uh a requirement freshman year of just humanities then you were given a choice of	2942	A
um you know there were ten or twelve or whatever fifteen- or fifteen different courses that that you could take but they all centered they all came out of Philosophy English and Literature departments and they were	2942	A
they were they were a set of assigned readings everybody had to read you know for so the first year Humanities courses everyone had to read the Iliad and- and and so forth and what they did though was they all approached it from	2942	A
from very different you know so- so they had you could have one class in the philosophy of something that that the philosophy of Greek mythology or something that actually approached this or um	2942	A
one literature you know or a literature- a literature course or just all sorts of different perspectives on it and people got to	2942	A
choose- pick and choose but but by the end everyone had a good sample of of of sort of how to think about these things non scientifically you know and	2942	A
and uh and that sort of forced them but i believe that that that that that that that you one of the one of the best things to do at least for me in school was was i was sort of forced to take lots of different kinds of courses	2942	A
um i was forced to take i think you know some sort of art history course	2942	A
and you- we all grumbled about it at first but then afterward we all wound up taking extra art history classes because it just seemed like something we we didn't totally know nothing about but just enjoyed very much doing and something i never would have done if i if- if i wasn't forced to take it	2942	A
hum hum	2942	A
yes um-hum and that and that really is something that that i notice like uh i talk to a lot of my friends at schools that are more specialized and they don't have that	2942	A
they just you know they went in and took their courses that they were expected to take and that was all they never had some of the more fun classes i guess	2942	A
i feel a little more worldly now	2942	A
yes i'm i'm i'm hoping i'm hoping	2942	A
yes i i graduated um college in eighty seven and i just went straight through	2942	A
um i'm finishing up next year so yeah i didn't- i didn't take any break or anything yet i've been trying actually in graduate school i've been trying to do the same thing take courses outside- it's completely outside my area and i'm finding that in graduate school it's a lot harder	2942	A
because_1 uh i just don't have the time anymore to sort of sit in a course	2942	A
that i'm not getting graded for whereas before i would just sign up for credit for it now i can't sign up for an art history course for credit necessarily	2942	A
so i have to try and go myself and i went for like two or three weeks and realized not enough time for the work unfortunately	2942	A
i'm pursuing a Doctorate in Psychology so i'm just	2942	A
wind up spending a lot of time doing that instead	2942	A
uh	2942	A
what else i i think i oh	2942	A
oh	2942	A
um-hum	2942	A
hum so you had real world experience in the middle there	2942	A
and that helped you think	2942	A
or that was	2942	A
um-hum	2942	A
hum yeah i'm getting some of that um i have i have sort of some work experience yet my wife is not an academic at all	2942	A
my wife is sort of in the real world and i so i sort of hinge halfway out in the real world getting you know real world especially she works in uh um	2942	A
she works in something i she she works for a temporary agency and- and i and i never would have had she's the office supervisor i never would have had any i've- i've learned much just sort of by watching her and her and her business as well so yeah so i i can see where that might be a	2942	A
yeah	2942	A
that's my oh yeah	2942	A
yes agreed agreed well i'll i'll take that i'll take that and think that through a little bit um	2942	A
yes	2942	A
um-hum	2942	A
uh-huh well having been there not too long ago and my wife having only recently completed a doctorate i'm fairly full of it of it myself uh	2942	B
the main point that i have about	2942	B
choosing where you want to go to school	2942	B
is that	2942	B
definitely- you have to early on define what it is you want to do	2942	B
or at least what area you want to be in	2942	B
uh i had the unpleasant experience of going through several	2942	B
schools that were very specialized	2942	B
i went through a number of them_1 uh undergraduate schools	2942	B
before i found a a good school that was more general uh to give me time to make up my mind	2942	B
that's wonderful i'm a great proponent of liberal arts education for anybody	2942	B
uh being an engineer now i believe in it even more strongly than i did before	2942	B
well thus far it's working to my advantage uh	2942	B
the great gap historically has with engineers has been while they may have all this technical information they have no way of imparting it to except to another engineer	2942	B
and i have the ability to listen to them and then translate that into something that non engineers can understand	2942	B
well it's a lot of fun at the moment	2942	B
even at that i have a son that who is only nine at the moment but i see him very rapidly becoming	2942	B
the engineering personality and uh if he decides to pursue that	2942	B
i'm going to insist that he spend two years at a liberal arts college before i'll even let him go to an engineering college and yes that'll add one year to his education experience	2942	B
yes it is	2942	B
oh i agree uh	2942	B
i have the experience uh the last school that i went to was Mississippi State University which is	2942	B
historically an engineering and agricultural school	2942	B
uh the typical land grant university every	2942	B
state's got one	2942	B
anyway it-	2942	B
while it has both engineering and liberal arts the	2942	B
engineering students tend to cluster together you know they're in classes together even when they're outside of the engineering department	2942	B
and they don't learn the communications they don't learn the thought processes of other fields of of endeavor it's you know it's kind of like	2942	B
if i were king for a day and got to and got to make one rule	2942	B
my rule would be no one could get out of high school without an entire year of philosophy	2942	B
and it's	2942	B
that's not even true in our colleges	2942	B
right	2942	B
yes i really-	2942	B
i remember that experience	2942	B
that and uh extra music classes	2942	B
well that will continue to grow	2942	B
even as you	2942	B
go beyond graduate school	2942	B
have have you gone straight through	2942	B
that's true are you pursuing a Master's or a Doctorate	2942	B
well let me let me encourage you to stop- stop and experience life along the way	2942	B
i i first enrolled in college in nineteen sixty six	2942	B
uh	2942	B
six years and a	2942	B
and a war later uh i got a degree an undergraduate degree	2942	B
and then	2942	B
fifteen years after that	2942	B
i got the first of a set of master's degrees and four years after that i got another master's degree	2942	B
oh yes	2942	B
it certainly- it certainly makes acceptance of different ideas a lot easier	2942	B
well vicarious learning is a wonderful thing uh you know it certainly means that we don't have to experience everything but experience is a wonderful teacher also	2942	B
my wife as- as- as i may have mentioned just finished a doctorate a couple of years ago and and she pursued her education along the lines that i did	2942	B
with lots of break in between and she feels reasonably comfortable teaching now she has an awful lot of experience to draw on no longer is-	2942	B
certainly um the weather here is warm and it's been sort of raining on and off	2950	B
and uh i'm an avid gardener so i measure- measure- measure the rain in our rain gauge on a on a regular basis so i can can avoid wasting money on watering	2950	B
and uh but it's been threatening to rain for the last couple of days and it has not really which is a bit of a disappointment but it is very warm here which is typical for this part of the time of the year how about Pennsylvania-	2950	B
it starts in uh March as a rule	2950	B
really this late could you have snow	2950	B
oh well we don't have that problem	2950	B
oh well that is nice	2950	B
uh well we will be glad i will be glad to give you some of ours usually we get it in in great quantities in April and May	2950	B
and then it stops for three months	2950	B
right	2950	B
um are you in an agricultural area	2950	B
well i know the weather- i know the weather is very important for people who make their living off of off of the land	2950	B
uh-huh	2950	B
uh-huh	2950	B
hum well you know there are some disadvantages to being down south and that is it gets so hot that you know a lot of things die during the summer from the heat	2950	B
they they really do and you have to be very careful to make sure you keep everything watered	2950	B
yeah well my parents are now in San Diego and and they've got pebbles in their yard because they can't almost nobody there has has lawns	2950	B
yeah uh it is very it is very rough on them so actually i think i think it is pretty moderate here in Dallas because_1 the the summers are extremely hot	2950	B
um what is your humidity- humidity like	2950	B
uh i don't know what what it is percentage wise but i	2950	B
yeah it's it's drier in Dallas than it is in Houston or San Antonio or even Austin which is further south but it is not dry and and i have lived here for many years and i think it has gotten more humid over the years where the water is coming from i don't know	2950	B
oh does he live near the lake	2950	B
uh-huh	2950	B
um	2950	B
um-hum	2950	B
that's that's a problem uh they tell you when you are looking for a house or or or buying land to build on to be very careful and check the drainage because uh it is it is deceptive	2950	B
and uh i know exactly what you mean	2950	B
uh-huh	2950	B
oh well that is fortunate	2950	B
um-hum well i- i like it i like it here uh i- i grew up here i have lived other places and and but i- i did grow up here and this is very much home for me and	2950	B
i hope you visited during the winter one of my one of my theories is that you always go to warm places during the winter and you go to cold cool places that well i go to cool places during the summer if i can anyway	2950	B
oh sure i mean	2950	B
i- i had a friend from England visit once at Christmas and we couldn't get her out of the what she called the back garden because she wanted to go back with a sunburn and she went back to the north of England with a sunburn	2950	B
well yeah basically i do too	2950	B
well i that that is really healthier frankly	2950	B
um-hum that-	2950	B
but you you know it is interesting because you get out in that sun an awful lot now my sister is a a sun fiend and uh she is five years younger than me she is more wrinkled	2950	B
yeah and i think that's why	2950	B
exactly	2950	B
i think it burns off the i don't know the the the theory the scientific principle but it burns something off the natural oils or something like that	2950	B
yes	2950	B
yes uh that sounds like a good that sounds like the right theory	2950	B
good	2950	B
well that's great it's been it's been very nice here too and i hope it continues because my parents are coming to visit this evening and i want them to have nice weather	2950	B
for their visit instead of driving around in the rain	2950	B
uh probably four or five days	2950	B
well thank you	2950	B
thanks	2950	B
yeah and the same to you	2950	B
a pleasure	2950	B
i'm sure i will in in fact if i hadn't been preparing for this the out of town visitors i probably would have been making some phone calls in the last couple of days	2950	B
well i am glad you have broken the ice with me because now i'll i'll start doing it okay well thanks Jean bye-bye	2950	B
okay you want to get a start	2950	A
uh-huh	2950	A
uh-huh	2950	A
oh great great	2950	A
uh-huh	2950	A
um-hum	2950	A
yeah i think you're i think you're earlier than we are as a rule aren't you your your your summer- growing summer starts a lot earlier than ours	2950	A
uh-huh see that is quite a bit we are just beginning people are have got their gardens in a lot of them now we could still have a frost	2950	A
um-hum uh probably not but we have had we have had a frost as late as as in June	2950	A
early june so but we- we have also had nice weather an unusually uh nice spring it is almost like an early summer for us	2950	A
uh-huh we could use a little more rain	2950	A
i believe	2950	A
uh	2950	A
um-hum um-hum	2950	A
yeah if it could just be spread out a little bit uh-huh uh-huh yeah it's really been nice here uh	2950	A
we're supposed to have some rain this weekend but i don't know if we'll get it or not a lot of times in our area the weather forecast has missed us	2950	A
the the weather they forecast for our area seems to go right past us and misses us just by well not too many miles	2950	A
yes um-hum we have	2950	A
um-hum um-hum	2950	A
yeah we have quite a few farmers we we live out in the country we're on a farm but we're not a farming person uh we have a garden but uh but we're not farmers	2950	A
um	2950	A
oh yeah they get burnt off	2950	A
uh-huh	2950	A
uh-huh yeah well and that makes it bad too because uh when more with water being at a premium	2950	A
i know our aunt in California they they've really been rationed on their water and it makes it real hard to have a yard or uh or anything like that a garden- their garden their farms their farmers i guess are hurting because of that also	2950	A
yeah	2950	A
yeah well they are not allowed to water so what do you do yeah	2950	A
uh-huh	2950	A
um-hum but your humidity is different though than ours i think and it makes a	2950	A
a bit of a difference too	2950	A
oh	2950	A
i don't know i think our humidity is higher normally than what it is in Texas i could be wrong	2950	A
i don't know for sure either but it always seems well it just felt different like when we were in Texas it had a different feel to it	2950	A
um um um-hum	2950	A
uh-huh well it could be i know my brother's home has been flooded a couple of times uh	2950	A
well there is a lake not far but it is more run off from surrounding you know areas and that	2950	A
and uh he's just in an area where it is just low enough that it's you know it it collects there and uh he has had a couple of inches in his house several times	2950	A
um-hum	2950	A
um-hum um-hum because of that um-hum	2950	A
we are fortunate or uh we are on a	2950	A
where we are we get flooded it floods below us behind us but we're uh we are high enough that our house itself we never you know have had any problem like that	2950	A
yeah it is an old farm house and uh we really like it here	2950	A
uh-huh	2950	A
uh-huh it is nice down there i- i- i liked it when we visited there	2950	A
right	2950	A
right that is the best time to go yeah and- and usually it has been when we have gone it has been nice it has been hot but it is it is hot to me in the wintertime down there	2950	A
you know but it is nice it's uh it's really a nice area	2950	A
oh really	2950	A
oh	2950	A
oh good heavens not me i avoid the sun	2950	A
yeah well i have had a little a couple of problems and uh i decided it is not worth it i- i like to get tan in the summer time because i think you look healthier and uh we are just crazy	2950	A
uh-huh	2950	A
is that right it it just makes your skin more leathery it uh it yeah so	2950	A
um-hum well the elasticity of your skin the collagen or whatever they call it they say it destroys a lot of that and you lose a lot of that so uh	2950	A
yeah but uh but we have really had nice the weather i can't complain we have really had really good weather of late and when it has rained it had- it's been a good soaking rain and uh	2950	A
it's just been a really nice Spring	2950	A
oh	2950	A
oh that's great how long will they be there	2950	A
uh-huh well that is great well i hope the weather stays real good for them and and uh that you have a good visit and everything and i hope your garden does good	2950	A
and so okay well it was really nice talking to you and uh	2950	A
yeah i forget to the day goes by and i forget to make a call usually	2950	A
great great okay uh bye-bye	2950	A
okay	2922	B
well i think we're we have pretty much narrowed it down to a Mazda minivan	2922	B
the new uh the uh M P V	2922	B
the uh the one that's the all wheel drive	2922	B
yes	2922	B
well we're we do it mainly because we travel- we do a lot of traveling and i want to do it in comfort	2922	B
right now we have we have we have a four door you know sedan but it's just uh it just doesn't have quite as much room and it's not very comfortable to drive long distance in	2922	B
well we've we've been looking for about you know two years to decide but you know with the style changes you know they're they're a lot of them are changing right now and we're trying to wait until we see what what it's going to you know the style going to stay for a while	2922	B
and uh supposedly the Mazda is going to change this coming year	2922	B
and we'll just we'll wait till the ninety twos come out	2922	B
no so that's that's pretty much uh you know where we stand now how about how about you	2922	B
yeah	2922	B
yeah you pretty much have to take advantage of the uh the wild and crazy while you can and then you got to turn into the practical	2922	B
that's kind of the way i've had to transition i was into you know the sportier cars and then uh when when when it comes to putting car seats and all that kind of stuff in it you know you just don't uh	2922	B
can't get away with it any longer	2922	B
or then and then you got to wait until you're you know after your kids are grown and you can scale back down again	2922	B
but uh you know right now i have a pickup truck	2922	B
and it's one of the supercabs and you can get you can get uh you know kids- kids and everything in there the only thing is it's it's not very comfortable	2922	B
yeah	2922	B
well they've made some changes over the you know the last couple of years since they've come out this year they're coming out with a new transmission a little bit heavier duty transmission	2922	B
which the Japanese are not well known for but uh	2922	B
but they're supposedly getting a new uh transmission in fact i think Board Warner's the one that going to going to design it for them	2922	B
and that'll that'll help some and uh they're going to change the interior to where the backseat itself can either be removed or laid laying down into a bed	2922	B
whereas now it can't	2922	B
you can lean it back a little bit but not all the way	2922	B
so we're looking at those type things also	2922	B
yeah plus you know the- the uh the wheel base uh	2922	B
the the way it is right now the all wheel drive	2922	B
the it's a little bit higher up off the ground but they're going to raise it three more inches up	2922	B
and a little bit more clearance	2922	B
and uh you know not that i really need it for any but i like sitting up high so you can see	2922	B
yes	2922	B
um	2922	B
that's kind of interesting	2922	B
forty seven thousand dollars is	2922	B
it's a little stiff	2922	B
yeah i agree i don't think even if i had the money to spend on it i don't think i'd buy one	2922	B
plus nowadays you know you- it cars are high anyway you know you can't hardly get anything decent for less than you know nineteen or twenty	2922	B
and that's that's a pretty big investment even nowadays and i want something that's going to last me for at least seven eight years	2922	B
and uh	2922	B
i just can't see you know these people spending these thirty five to forty five thousand dollars on BMWs and Mercedes and then trading them_1 every year or two	2922	B
God that's so that's silly	2922	B
i uh i- i like i say i don't- i think even if i had the money i wouldn't want something like that it's just not within my it's just it's impractical	2922	B
too many other good things you can do with the money besides waste it uh i just uh you know there's too many people that need things and	2922	B
you know places that you can put it	2922	B
not not to waste money like that	2922	B
yeah i mean it'd be nice to be able to afford it but i i'm just not i even if i had the money i i'm i know for a fact i just wouldn't i wouldn't buy one i just can't bring myself to do that kind of stuff	2922	B
but uh	2922	B
we try to keep our cars on an average of eight to ten years if we can if we can get by with it we have a Volvo right now that's	2922	B
it's seven years old and it's got uh about eighty five thousand miles on it and it still drives like it's brand new	2922	B
about that's about right and we we anticipate on keeping that car for hopefully another five six seven years if we can if we can make it go that long	2922	B
well Volvos uh there's a lot of them_1 that we in fact we have a mutual friend uh	2922	B
my wife and i that uh	2922	B
they uh they just passed three hundred thousand miles on theirs	2922	B
it's still mechanically fine now you you know there there's there's money to invest in it during during that three hundred thousand miles you know uh timing chains and and various other things but	2922	B
all in all if you if you take it mileage uh based on what you spent over that life of the car	2922	B
relatively cheap	2922	B
so uh	2922	B
you know i- i so far i can't complain it's been a good car and and we're going we're like i say we'll try to keep it for a long time it's been paid off for several years	2922	B
yeah and uh	2922	B
the the only other thing is you know the the pickup truck's nice but it's impractical for for traveling and family so we'll get something that we can haul stuff in if we have to and then have it for you know trips and and everything	2922	B
well nowadays it pays to shop because you're going to have to live with it for a while you know if you if you're paying for it for three or four years	2922	B
uh that's a long time right there in itself and then you don't want to turn around and and you know the next time you buy a car it's going to be more expensive and uh you don't want to start another payment that's going to be up around four or five hundred dollars a month	2922	B
so uh it it's it's crazy so	2922	B
but the little that eighty two Bonneville that you have that that uh that's probably a pretty good car	2922	B
yeah well you know uh things like that that go out you know if you replace them it's just so costly anyway	2922	B
it's crazy	2922	B
yeah	2922	B
well and your wife has what kind of car	2922	B
oh Ferenza	2922	B
yeah okay that's Pontiac okay or Olds Firenza yeah	2922	B
um-hum	2922	B
so now you've got some rust	2922	B
that's terrible that's one that's one bad thing about living in an area where you have to put salt on the roads	2922	B
oh	2922	B
so what kind of car do you want	2922	A
oh	2922	A
um-hum	2922	A
do you have a family	2922	A
uh that helps	2922	A
um-hum	2922	A
you you sound like you've been looking recently or you're buying soon	2922	A
um-hum	2922	A
that won't be much longer	2922	A
yeah	2922	A
well actually i haven't it's funny i haven't been looking at all i mean because um i'm a grad student and	2922	A
and my wife's got an eighty seven	2922	A
Olds Ferenza and i have an eighty two Bonneville	2922	A
which basically our our our our plan is to wait another year until i'm done with graduate school and then sell the Bonneville for whatever we can get for it and go out and buy another- a a new car some place else and i think	2922	A
we probably- i'm i'm sort of stuck i want half of me wants some sort of little sporty thing just for the hell of it because it may be the last time i can drive one for a long time and the other half of me says be pragmatic and get some sort of	2922	A
um probably small economical car for a couple of years and then get something bigger like a minivan when when when we have kids and stuff or or or when we travel a lot	2922	A
yeah	2922	A
right	2922	A
yeah they don't work	2922	A
yeah	2922	A
right well it's a it's a it's note like the i've seen that Mazda van and and it seems like it would be the right thing then	2922	A
right	2922	A
oh okay that'll be nice	2922	A
oh okay	2922	A
right	2922	A
that's just yeah it's thinking ahead	2922	A
it's real good	2922	A
that'll give you a little extra	2922	A
yeah	2922	A
yeah it's actually a real nice feeling	2922	A
i uh grew up driving the Suburban and then recently i test drove	2922	A
um for some strange reason i test drove a Range Rover	2922	A
not because i was going to buy a forty thousand dollar Jeep mind you	2922	A
but just but but because um my my wife works for a temporary- agency and	2922	A
they and and they had a job and they called me basically i basically i was shopping the agent to make sure you know he was doing good things by Range Rover you know	2922	A
they sent me out as a to sort of act like i wanted to buy one	2922	A
basically and then report back to the company as to how the salesman is doing	2922	A
so i had to act like a buyer and uh	2922	A
yeah it's a neat little um it's it's it's	2922	A
it's sort of like being a scab i guess in a sense but uh but i used you know i mean he did a wonderful job so i just went back and said wonderful things about him you know but we went and part of it was test driving a Range Rover and i realized afterward you know it's a real nice ride because it's nice you're nice and high	2922	A
lots of clearance and stuff like that like you said but	2922	A
forty thousand dollars- yeah that's just way too much for for a jeep in my opinion	2922	A
no i wouldn't i mean i would get if i wanted to pick out a car like that i'd go for a Bronco or or or you know Blazer or something i figure it's	2922	A
yeah	2922	A
yeah	2922	A
oh yeah this this is nothing i mean he um he was showing me they had this i was you know they had they had a beamer there that was seventy eight thousand and a Mercedes that was ninety	2922	A
you know and the man claimed that he sold fourteen of these Mercedes the previous year	2922	A
it was amazing	2922	A
yeah	2922	A
it totally impractical- and i- i can't imagine what's that much better about them that	2922	A
right	2922	A
yeah i agree	2922	A
it'd be nice to think that i could afford it mind you but	2922	A
yeah no i wouldn't	2922	A
i was going to say a Volvo at eighty five thousand miles is still being broken in isn't it	2922	A
i mean	2922	A
yeah those- aren't- aren't those the ones that that have is it Volvo or Saab that has like the three hundred thousand mile club and	2922	A
and the car's probably still fine right	2922	A
right	2922	A
it's wonderful	2922	A
yeah	2922	A
the- that's- that's nice to have no payments yeah	2922	A
um-hum	2922	A
that's great you've really thought this out it sounds like i mean i'm sort of you know i sort of look around and go yeah that's a nice car that's a nice car but i haven't really	2922	A
right	2922	A
uh	2922	A
to be paying for a car	2922	A
that's true	2922	A
that's that that that's real true actually	2922	A
that's that's actually it's got um it's actually it's low on mileage given that that it's eighty two it's only got seventy five thousand on it and uh	2922	A
or seventy four or whatever you know and it's it's in uh it's a funny coincidence that my- my cousin sold me the car	2922	A
i can't open it it has electronic windows unfortunately electric windows and doors and the uh	2922	A
and the passenger window is gone you know it doesn't open any more but i'm not going to fix it because i'm going to sell it in a year	2922	A
yeah it's it's it's seventy five dollars for the motor alone	2922	A
and then another seventy five to install it you know so that can that that that's crazy or like the air conditioning went the air conditioning sort of blowing warm air so i went down to the you know my local mechanic and for forty dollars they did an air conditioning check and they	2922	A
went through everything i told them to put in a shot of Freon and they said yeah it needs a shot of Freon but then he came back and he said well the reason you're losing the Freon is because you have a leak in this condenser line and when i- and that's a hundred and fifty dollars to fix that and then while we're in there we have to change this this and this and you know and	2922	A
so it would- would- would- would have wound up costing me close to four hundred dollars but he said look if you're selling the car in a year don't bother doing it all he said i'll give you a shot of Freon every now and then and and you're- you're fine you know so	2922	A
she has an eighty seven um Ferenza it's an Oldsmobile- yeah it's an Oldsmobile	2922	A
yeah no it's Olds actually olds yeah that's actually a real good car i'm finding it's uh mechanically is very sound um	2922	A
unfortunately the body was uh rust proofed by a company called Rusty Jones	2922	A
which i'm not sure if you've ever heard of or not but uh	2922	A
Rusty Jones went out of business because their rust proofing wasn't very good	2922	A
and now i've got some i mean the eighty two has	2922	A
no rust at all and the eighty seven has some pretty big rust spots on it so it's	2922	A
so and	2922	A
yeah actually we're we're looking forward to getting out of here	2922	A
we're yeah in a year i'm done and then we're moving south or west	2922	A
or southwest	2922	A
hi	2939	B
um	2939	B
yeah	2939	B
right- right yeah that's the	2939	B
yeah	2939	B
um-hum	2939	B
right	2939	B
um-hum	2939	B
yeah	2939	B
oh that's good uh	2939	B
yeah well it's uh so far as vegetable gardening is concerned it has been uh many years since i've tried any of that uh i we did have uh we've been in our house uh where we're located now for about fifteen years	2939	B
and about uh eight nine	2939	B
about nine years ago i guess we put a swimming pool in our backyard	2939	B
which means we don't have a backyard anymore	2939	B
uh so our our gardening is pretty much uh limited to	2939	B
plants uh you know shrubs and and trees that- that kind of gardening	2939	B
uh i	2939	B
in the years that i did have vegetable gardens there were you know there were times when i had really good gardens and there were times when they just they weren't very good at all and i guess uh the soil and the and the bugs together	2939	B
sort of	2939	B
um-hum yeah i wouldn't doubt that	2939	B
uh i always like to try to grow squash and uh the squash bugs would- would just go crazy	2939	B
and uh	2939	B
and in in my experience with tomatoes was that if i got tomatoes at all they usually got uh sun blisters you know or or it would rain on them_1 and they would bust open you know when the heat hit them_1	2939	B
but uh	2939	B
yeah but uh but there were you know there were years uh we- i grew uh the little plum salad type tomatoes uh quite a bit and had real good luck with those	2939	B
uh one year at- at a the house we lived in before which was also here in Richardson uh we grew okra and i i picked okra up until almost Christmas	2939	B
yeah and uh and i still- i still occasionally will grow uh jalapeno peppers uh we we like jalapenos and they they grow real well too now you can just stick one of those anywhere	2939	B
uh	2939	B
one of the things that we're doing talking about uh about lawns and shrubs uh we have a live oak tree in our front yard	2939	B
and we just have more trouble getting grass to grow underneath that	2939	B
and we're in the process or at least in the planning stage of of putting in a bed around that oak tree	2939	B
uh right yeah we're going to just have a ground you know put ground cover and and maybe- you know maybe a few low plants under there	2939	B
right	2939	B
and uh	2939	B
right	2939	B
right we uh	2939	B
uh uh we uh brought some plants out we're from both from East Texas and we brought some plants in from there and uh one- one of the things that we brought uh unintentionally was uh violets	2939	B
which is like- almost like a ground cover	2939	B
and they really spread- they really spread out and grow uh pretty rapidly when they you know when they're growing well	2939	B
but uh	2939	B
but they uh they are i guess uh not an annual but a	2939	B
they they volunteer to come back every year but they do die off during the winter i've forgotten what the term is for that	2939	B
but uh but they do die back during the winter so that you know they are not really very satisfactory for a you know for a full ground cover because of that	2939	B
but uh	2939	B
um-hum	2939	B
yeah um i i don't i'm not familiar with that pear tree uh but it's a non bearing pear is that right yeah	2939	B
uh and then the uh of course the leaves drop off during the winter right so	2939	B
yeah we have uh we've had real good luck with uh and again these are like volunteer trees that we transplanted from east Texas but we've got a couple uh well we did buy one though we have a couple of red bud trees	2939	B
and uh we've got one of those on our patio uh we've got a lot of rock and and around in our one area of our patio	2939	B
and we brought a a red bud tree in and it has done very well it has a a a little larger leaf than uh	2939	B
maybe even than a pear tree i know it's got larger leaves than a plum tree has	2939	B
the uh the leaves are probably uh oh four inches or so in diameter	2939	B
and uh	2939	B
you know makes a pretty good uh tree it-	2939	B
it it has uh of course during the early spring it has the red you know the red flowers that are really pretty	2939	B
uh the only problem with it is it does have a seed pod uh you know a little it's a little flat bean type seed pod	2939	B
that uh will drop off you know uh when uh when they start drying out so there's a little bit of clean up work for that	2939	B
yeah yeah always it's	2939	B
uh with- with our in our case uh it's fairly close to our swimming pool	2939	B
and so the uh the flowers uh uh blow in there they don't drop in but they blow into the swimming pool so there's a good- a good bit of cleanup you know in the swimming pool from that but it's you know it's not too bad even at that so	2939	B
right and uh	2939	B
but uh yeah we we've really enjoyed that uh the live oak tree that we have uh is in the front and of course the live oak is uh	2939	B
it's susceptible to bending by the wind it- it it leans away from the predominant wind direction	2939	B
and i think i think you'll find that uh we also have an apple tree uh in our side yard and it does the same thing the the southwesternly- winds- -southwesternly winds	2939	B
which are predominant you know during the growing season make both of those trees lean	2939	B
toward the northeast	2939	B
and uh so it's but that's uh the live oak tree that's you'll find that uh pretty much anywhere that there are if there's a grove of live oaks growing they're going to be leaning away from the you know the direction of the wind	2939	B
uh if you	2939	B
yeah	2939	B
right the uh	2939	B
what kind of grasses are you growing	2939	B
um-hum	2939	B
yeah	2939	B
Saint Augustine- right	2939	B
hm	2939	B
right	2939	B
yeah	2939	B
right	2939	B
yeah what you what you will find uh with the Saint Augustine grass is it's very susceptible to both diseases and to grub worms	2939	B
you know uh the the grub worm is the larva of the uh June beetle	2939	B
the June bug beetle and uh the grub worms uh in the late spring uh the the beetles come in and and they lay their eggs in the grass	2939	B
and then the grub worms come out in the larva stage and they eat the grass off at the roots they eat the roots of the grass off	2939	B
and uh we- we had Saint Augustine uh in uh our yard before i mean before we the house we were in before and one year all of the Saint Augustine in our backyard died-	2939	B
well hi Bob	2939	A
hi um my lawn and garden well that that's quite a topic because uh basically my husband takes care of it	2939	A
um but what he's done is he's done a raised garden in the back yard because that we don't have dirt around here you understand that the- it's it's sludge it's it's mud it's cruddy	2939	A
so you know instead of uh trying to break every rototiller that we ever rented um we've just decided to do the raised garden and it works out great he just built like a twelve by eight box	2939	A
out of um lumber that's you know the {Wolmanized} lumber and it's i guess it's maybe oh say eighteen inches wide so it makes a really nice box set that on top of the dirt	2939	A
and then worked and worked and worked with the soil i mean bag after bag from Wolfe Nursery to uh fill it up	2939	A
but over the years it has produced some of the best vegetables and garden um you know type things that	2939	A
boy it's been really great and right now we have tomatoes out there and we've got you know have eggplant we're growing corn corn grows great here so um we really enjoy that a lot	2939	A
oh	2939	A
right	2939	A
it's it's amazing they come up well someone told me they they come in the in the uh packs you know the seed packages that's where the bugs come from	2939	A
yeah oh those oh yeah we've given up on those ourselves	2939	A
yeah i guess we've got an early early grow variety or something like that and they're just now you know starting to turn red so before- hopefully before all this heat hits	2939	A
we'll have some tomatoes	2939	A
uh-huh	2939	A
i know what you mean green peppers grow like crazy too around here	2939	A
right yeah	2939	A
definitely	2939	A
right right	2939	A
um-hum	2939	A
yeah	2939	A
i think that'd be really pretty really nice	2939	A
i think- i think that Asian jasmine just is so aggressive it'll take no time at all to surround that tree and probably your house and your back yard and your pool the way it goes	2939	A
oh	2939	A
oh	2939	A
oh	2939	A
oh	2939	A
that would be a good idea	2939	A
yeah	2939	A
yeah	2939	A
well that you know one project we're looking at is we're building a deck out back and we want to put a tree in and we've been looking around and maybe you could you know suggest something but	2939	A
um the tree that we've sort of you know come upon is a Bradford pear and we wanted it for shade and we wanted it for- you know for the leaf and um that's	2939	A
you know	2939	A
right it does- it's yeah it's ornamental	2939	A
oh red bud	2939	A
um-hum	2939	A
that would be a great shade tree then	2939	A
um-hum	2939	A
um	2939	A
but as long as you mow the grass around well you said it was around rocks but	2939	A
oh	2939	A
well that's just in the springtime too isn't it	2939	A
oh	2939	A
yeah	2939	A
oh that's interesting get to know all these things	2939	A
leaning away from	2939	A
well that's interesting yeah i know that um we've done some other things with the grass and trying to	2939	A
you know get the right combination of grass here	2939	A
because_1 it's	2939	A
well we see- ours was a model house so when they set it up they had like these cement walkways across the front yard	2939	A
and they had planted bermuda and then when they took the cement walkways out they stuck in um what- what is that Saint Augustine stuff	2939	A
and i am a transplant here from the north myself and so when i saw that Saint Augustine i said oh weeds and i spent i mean weeks just pulling it up bag by bag	2939	A
until i went to the nursery one day and found out they were selling it by plugs you know and i could have made some money on all those big huge black bags of stuff i'd thrown out so we're trying to um	2939	A
after- after this winter we had a lot of winter kill and hopefully you know some of the Bermuda will take over and because i really like that grass	2939	A
yeah that yeah the grubs	2939	A
um-hum	2939	A
right-	2939	A
are you in the market for a car recently	2993	A
oh what'd you get	2993	A
uh-huh what what convinced you to get that one	2993	A
um-hum	2993	A
oh incredible how many miles on it	2993	A
and it's still running real well	2993	A
oh great yeah we have um right now we have two cars um i have my husband and myself we have two sons who are drivers	2993	A
and one of which is a um an eighty eight Plymouth Voyager Van and then we have um about a year ago we picked up a second hand uh uh Audi	2993	A
uh and uh that was a car- you know a car- a sedan and uh we got that i don't i'll	2993	A
the major things the reason why we got that is we had had a Nova and a well my son was driving and someone came into his lane and hit	2993	A
him and fortunately he was able to his i mean he was checked out of the hospital was out of the hospital by that night but the car was completely totaled	2993	A
and Mike and they had been my sons- two sons had been a passenger in a car about a year and a half before that which was hit by another car	2993	A
so i mean i got i was getting really nervous so i finally said we i want a really solid car	2993	A
so we found the Audi second hand i guess right now my criteria for cars is uh uh solid- being solid able to take an impact	2993	A
and uh so uh i we're not going to be in the market for in the near future for any new car	2993	A
but the the things that i would want would be a solid car another thing i'd definitely want would be antilock brakes	2993	A
uh our our van which is a a delight to drive does not have i- i think the brakes on the Plymouth van is just are terrible	2993	A
um if the road is at all wet and i'm and i don't go all that fast but the uh it it just doesn't hold it doesn't hold well at all	2993	A
so uh i i definitely would want to get antilock brakes so i don't know uh do you have any particular things that	2993	A
that are priorities on your list	2993	A
yeah	2993	A
i guess down there air conditioning's a must isn't it	2993	A
uh-huh	2993	A
that's incredible that is incredible	2993	A
uh we we get about our the uh van gets on highways can get about twenty eight the Audi does not have good mileage that's the one drawback it's a powerful car	2993	A
um	2993	A
but it does not uh i mean i if i'm on a highway and i can get twenty twenty one miles in per gallon	2993	A
i consider that lucky- i'm lucky maybe maybe sometimes i've gotten twenty two it comes out around the eighteen or nineteen local driving and that's a to me is a real drawback i wish i would you know i could settle for twenty eight or	2993	A
but uh the um the frills on that car are nice but they're not necessary for me except air conditioning in this area uh in Washington DC area it gets hot and humid	2993	A
yeah uh so air conditioning is definitely- uh definitely a necessity for us through two or three months in the summer um but i um	2993	A
yeah but or you know if you want to have open windows to be able to open- if you're alone in the car just to press buttons and but you know i've lived all these years without them i probably could have lived a little longer	2993	A
uh one of the things that we have uh we've liked when we've gotten a new car and this this used car has it is a sun roof	2993	A
and those are really nice in- in good weather	2993	A
so uh so i guess if we get a new car it definitely would have to have antilock- antilock brakes i'd love to get uh an air bag	2993	A
and a sun roof	2993	A
and uh just so it'd be a good solid car i guess that's those are my- my major criteria everything else is you know a luxury and they make the car more expensive but they often add more things to repair when things go wrong	2993	A
so uh but- if you were to buy a new car now a brand new car what would you look for	2993	A
um-hum	2993	A
yeah yeah	2993	A
isn't that true it's it's funny um	2993	A
uh that you use uh the Audi's German and i have to say it has been pretty dependable	2993	A
yeah sometimes- one advantage of an American made car is if you get stuck anywhere most local garages can fix you up	2993	A
but once you get if you start- once you get something fancy you get stuck somewhere off of the main area you can be really and the parts i know the Audi parts are terribly expensive	2993	A
i- i mean it just- i shudder i would not get the Audi again just for that reason	2993	A
but i would love i wish an American an American that you know engineering would make something as solid as a German car	2993	A
you know we certainly have the technology but it's amazing when we bought this Audi i mean everything is more solid in it	2993	A
uh it- you don't feel you've got any of the flabby plastic	2993	A
and i know and i i and i'm willing to give up a little bit in the mileage for a for a solid car i don't think i have to give up as much as i'm giving up	2993	A
but uh do you need air conditioning down there	2993	A
yeah	2993	A
oh we've had eleven days in a row over ninety	2993	A
they've in fact had to excuse school down here because of that	2993	A
well listen i enjoyed talking with you	2993	A
okay and enjoy enjoy your car	2993	A
thank you you too it's going to be a hot one okay bye-bye	2993	A
yeah i just bought a car	2993	B
i got a nineteen eighty three Cavalier station wagon	2993	B
well a a friend of my father's and he'd driven it all over the country and it runs great	2993	B
it's like it has a hundred and fifty three thousand	2993	B
yeah	2993	B
um-hum	2993	B
um-hum	2993	B
um-hum	2993	B
um	2993	B
right	2993	B
um-hum	2993	B
right	2993	B
hm	2993	B
well it's i didn't really need power windows but it has power you know windows and steering and air conditioning and and uh	2993	B
um-hum oh yeah it it has a stereo and a cassette player and um it he's told me it gets forty two miles to gallon	2993	B
um-hum	2993	B
so	2993	B
um-hum	2993	B
um-hum	2993	B
um-hum	2993	B
really- um-hum it's really humid	2993	B
right	2993	B
um-hum	2993	B
crank yeah um-hum	2993	B
right	2993	B
you don't have to stretch	2993	B
that's true	2993	B
um-hum	2993	B
that's right	2993	B
um-hum	2993	B
right	2993	B
um yeah like you said antilock brakes and air bag and uh i'd i'd really like to have a car that's dependable	2993	B
that that you drive you know like a	2993	B
American made car that's as dependable as Mercedes or something you know that's-	2993	B
um-hum	2993	B
yeah they have parts uh-huh	2993	B
right	2993	B
um-hum	2993	B
right	2993	B
um-hum	2993	B
right	2993	B
yes we really do because_1 even today it's it's supposed to get up into the nineties so	2993	B
um-hum	2993	B
oh	2993	B
it was nice talking to you	2993	B
yeah have a nice summer	2993	B
yeah bye	2993	B
what type of news media do you prefer for keeping up with current events	2966	A
okay	2966	A
the news shows themselves or uh like network news or national or uh	2966	A
okay how about shows like uh Sixty Minutes or or Twenty Twenty	2966	A
yeah i kind of watch for uh what what they're going to cover on Sixty Minutes if it's not if it doesn't look interesting uh pass on that	2966	A
yeah i'll only get the newspaper a couple of days a week but uh i get a lot of calls from uh the Morning News and the Times Herald where they want to sell me the paper at a special rate but uh no i'll only read it on on Fridays and Sundays typically	2966	A
Friday because they have a house and garden section in the paper	2966	A
yeah i get the Sunday paper because of the TV schedule	2966	A
but i'll flip through and see what read the headlines see what's new	2966	A
yeah i- i don't listen to the radio for news that's strictly for entertainment while i'm driving to and from work	2966	A
and for waking up in the morning have to set the alarm	2966	A
whatever news they cover they usually read out of the newspaper that day	2966	A
oh i thought CNN was great	2966	A
but uh	2966	A
i was glued to the TV all during that time watching CNN but after after it was over i haven't even tuned in to CNN since	2966	A
uh-huh	2966	A
yeah there has to be absolutely nothing else on TV before i turn on CNN usually	2966	A
yeah uh i'll catch uh some of these news briefs that they have say at the top of the hour in the evening	2966	A
and they'll mention the subject and say they have details at ten i hate it when they do that because i usually don't catch the news at ten o'clock and they don't fill you in at that time on uh what's going on	2966	A
even though it's something interesting that you may want to watch	2966	A
um yeah usually with the people i work with uh	2966	A
uh we don't talk too much about the news but if something comes up uh yeah it's a topic for discussion at the lunch table	2966	A
uh-huh	2966	A
no we don't discuss too much uh too much news except for at lunch unless there are rumors for pertaining to layoffs or company business things of that nature	2966	A
uh-huh	2966	A
yeah	2966	A
you get a lot of different perspectives that way	2966	A
uh-huh do you get any news magazines	2966	A
okay i don't get any news magazines but i do get a uh a photography magazine that does have a lot of photo journalism in it	2966	A
which is interesting	2966	A
instead of reading about the news you get to look at the pictures	2966	A
uh-huh	2966	A
okay	2966	A
yeah yeah i think the coverage has gotten better are are you real satisfied with the TV news coverage	2966	A
are there other things that you'd like them to to spend more time on	2966	A
they're they're very limited they have half hour to provide- provide all the news weather sports and what not and uh most of the major stories are the same across all the network- major networks but uh	2966	A
they do have uh	2966	A
uh scoops and specific stories that um i'll say one network that another one won't cover	2966	A
uh-huh	2966	A
yeah	2966	A
yeah i think it's good that we do get a lot of variety in news coverage although uh TV networks and uh there are radio stations that uh specifically cater to the news	2966	A
yeah well it's like i read a lot at work and i really have to make an effort to read anything when i get home	2966	A
i think that's why uh uh reading newspaper suffers to watching TV and TV is more entertaining uh it uh usually have it on all the time when i'm at home whether i'm watching it or not	2966	A
yeah um	2966	A
that's uh that's a weekly chore	2966	A
get rid of the old newspapers that haven't been read	2966	A
yeah	2966	A
well i get the Sunday paper tomorrow and i'll pull out the TV section and put that aside and i get out the sports section and read that and then i start clipping coupons	2966	A
and if i have any time uh later in the week to read the rest of it i may pick it up and uh glance at it but uh i usually don't scan it cover to cover	2966	A
yeah	2966	A
huh	2966	A
that's interesting	2966	A
no	2966	A
uh-huh	2966	A
right	2966	A
yeah i believe that's true	2966	A
uh-huh	2966	A
yeah well think that's that gets back to what i was saying before about uh the say the network news coverage they only have so much time to provide so much uh coverage of the news	2966	A
and they can't get very in depth in the with the within the limitations of the time that they have to present it	2966	A
well	2966	A
sure but uh you're talking about uh sensationalism here that you have to report the news and typically news is is uh or types- the types of events that uh shock people or uh	2966	A
uh major crimes uh	2966	A
court cases things of that nature and most uh it's just a fact that most things that make news are are bad types of occurrences	2966	A
they aren't uh positive in nature	2966	A
yeah there is a show on	2966	A
there is a show on in fact it was on tonight at eight o'clock called Cops have you ever seen that	2966	A
that's very very interesting gives you a whole new perspective of the police department	2966	A
right	2966	A
yeah well i think they actually came up with that to show not just to to fill in on Saturday night but to promote the image of the police department	2966	A
because it does show uh what positive impact the police have in the society	2966	A
not just that they're always there when bad things happen	2966	A
oh yeah	2966	A
well like environmentalist and uh	2966	A
okay normally i watch uh TV	2966	B
uh usually twice a day	2966	B
oh basically network news	2966	B
was it	2966	B
once in a while depending what i think's going to come on when they put on the previews	2966	B
yeah that's about what i do	2966	B
but uh usually i hit the headlines when i walk by book stores or anything else on papers but i normally don't buy newspapers	2966	B
Fridays and Sundays why Friday	2966	B
oh	2966	B
okay Sunday's usually my big one	2966	B
yeah i enjoy just point blank reading basically the headlines and i go especially if i've seen something one way or the other and i hit the	2966	B
TV to find out actually what's going on around here	2966	B
oh it's same way here	2966	B
what about when um	2966	B
Desert Storm was on	2966	B
yeah well see i had the radio going on that almost all the time especially between jobs on that and that's when i hit the radio but	2966	B
when they stopped i stopped	2966	B
but uh now i like	2966	B
see i usually i hit the six o'clock and usually the ten	2966	B
but uh sometimes i have to search on ten because they get	2966	B
boring they pick up the same thing on six so i usually have to search to see if anything is come up or not	2966	B
right	2966	B
do you ever discuss at work	2966	B
now see usually when i was working at TI we hit about eight o'clock in the morning we all just what was news and coming up and all so we just-	2966	B
hack it out between all of us one way or the other	2966	B
but uh	2966	B
well ours was kind of strange because we'd hit um	2966	B
since we were all females and uh	2966	B
we'd hit either the blacks because two of us were black	2966	B
one- one two three four of us are white	2966	B
and so it would be a cross between all of it going in together	2966	B
and uh i really enjoyed that i really enjoyed that because we got	2966	B
a cross section of viewpoints	2966	B
and it was fascinating in the morning so we ended up getting there well	2966	B
we were all there usually by seven thirty	2966	B
it was- it was fascinating it really was i really enjoyed it and i think everyone else did otherwise we wouldn't keep doing it every morning	2966	B
but	2966	B
no	2966	B
oh that would be interesting	2966	B
i'm not uh	2966	B
i don't seem to find time to read	2966	B
too much except of the stuff i'm studying right now	2966	B
but uh news wise that way no	2966	B
but i have realized most of mine uh from the TV i think has increased watching the news	2966	B
since the since the war	2966	B
um	2966	B
well see i'm like as i said i pick up on Sixty Minutes or Twenty Twenty usually my favorite is Sixty Minutes	2966	B
and i'll pick up on them and find out what they're going to see and then i'll pick up the rest of the stories- stories like that and get into like that but	2966	B
not uh	2966	B
most of the time if a really interesting one thing or another i'll go a little bit further but usually it's i just don't have the time	2966	B
but i can understand now why some of the newspaper's circulation has gone down	2966	B
because it's so much easier to watch the TV and keep at least ninety percent abreast and watching you know reading the newspaper and forget it	2966	B
well i got tired with newspapers because i seem to stack them_1 up without reading them_1	2966	B
i found out when i got the newspaper that it i'd read the headlines front page and maybe through a couple other sections and	2966	B
then i start packing them_1 up and i'm going i never read this what am i you know why even subscribe to it when i'm not reading it	2966	B
well see like when they have that recycle program on was it Save the Earth Save America i think what it was	2966	B
i watched that twice i recorded that because there were some things in there i wanted	2966	B
that i hadn't written down so i had recorded that but you can't find that in the newspaper	2966	B
but see i take that as far as my concern that's news to me	2966	B
because i enjoy something like that	2966	B
but uh	2966	B
i wonder about the rest of the world in itself how much they get or how much i talk to	2966	B
people that i work with at night now and the younger group they don't watch too much	2966	B
they don't even see it but i think they're being raised watching TV more than newspapers	2966	B
so i wish they'd put a little bit more depth in some of their stories	2966	B
i think they could	2966	B
use a little more of it a little bit wiser and put a little more positive in some of their stories than complete negative all the time	2966	B
well that's too true to a degree if they can put a complete half hour TV program on of what police have done to	2966	B
um	2966	B
or fireman you know off handed when they go in and find people or going down all all sorts of things you know what i'm talking about	2966	B
sorry about that	2966	B
right	2966	B
i've seen parts of it that's one of them	2966	B
um	2966	B
there there is lots of stories out there about people what they've done	2966	B
out of you know stop on the highway and stop someone uh just because there was an accident one way or the other	2966	B
to me that's positive	2966	B
see so you wouldn't see like that's a cop show fine but there's positive in	2966	B
many different areas	2966	B
that they could push a little bit more on TV	2966	B
okay	2925	B
well what do you think about gun control	2925	B
yeah	2925	B
i wouldn't be for- against control if it	2925	B
made it virtually impossible for even criminals to get them	2925	B
that's the problem is when you when you you know you take it away from the people who don't intend to ever use them for for a violent crime other than hunting and things like that	2925	B
and the criminals can always continue to get the guns regardless they can get them_1 through the black market or whatever so i'm not sure if gun control in it's true sense that they're trying to implement it will ever work	2925	B
um-hum	2925	B
yeah i think you know if it when it came down to these uh what i what i would consider militant type guns assault rifles and you know hand guns because_1 i'm i'm not i'm not a real advocate of hand guns i- i mean i do i do own one	2925	B
but i own it for protection i know how to use it i know when not to use it	2925	B
i think for the person that's inexperienced has no business with one	2925	B
uh	2925	B
yeah	2925	B
yeah	2925	B
well the reason i say we were uh we personally have experienced a major crime in our family	2925	B
and uh you know with my wife and daughter	2925	B
they were kidnapped	2925	B
and	2925	B
you know and and it's really made me look differently	2925	B
at the way it is you know and uh i'm not saying that i if i'd had a gun i could have done you know anything because_1 i- i really wasn't even there it happened while i was away but	2925	B
but i think there are certain cases where it could get you in trouble you have to be able to know when it when it can and when it can't if it came in the middle of the night where if i could get my hands on it and do something with it that's one thing uh	2925	B
that's all right	2925	B
well i've kind of got pros and cons about both there there there there's good things and bad things and there's there's a lot of details that you you know it's hard to work out all the details	2925	B
yeah i assure you it it can it can and and the chances you know because_1 we've been through a lot of the the court battles and all this other stuff over the years because_1 they're behind bars now but	2925	B
but they won't be there long and and we we've had to deal you know we've had to deal with a lot of that and	2925	B
the the frightening thing is and and i can i can tell you from you know just statistics and and from even other people i've talked with your chances is one is actually one in three right now	2925	B
one out of every third person is has and i'm talking about a major crime committed against them_1 now it's one out of every four or five for just a a crime	2925	B
whether it be just normal robbery or whatever	2925	B
well actually the- a a higher fence is less is more of a security risk	2925	B
than a normal average six foot fence did you know that	2925	B
yeah we thought because_1 we had an eight foot fence	2925	B
the problem is they can get behind it and they can do a lot behind an eight foot fence	2925	B
that they can't do behind a normal fence	2925	B
um in fact they say it's actually it's you're actually more secure if you have no fence at all	2925	B
but uh	2925	B
yes	2925	B
yes	2925	B
yeah they well they didn't use them but they put they put the guns to their heads	2925	B
yeah	2925	B
and you know they they physically were not harmed in any way they were very lucky	2925	B
and and knowing the guy and his record his normal motif is to kill them_1 he just he just happened not to he put them in the trunk of her car and drove them out and left them_1	2925	B
yeah he's just basically crazy he's he's been he's been in prisons you know a couple times	2925	B
and yet he's out in a very little time	2925	B
one he's one person but he's he's used them not maybe necessarily killed them but that's his normal style i mean that that's what he would do in a in a confronted situation	2925	B
uh you know he's he's been it's been proven that he that he's not uh	2925	B
society material	2925	B
but yet you know he'll like i say he'll be back out on the street just because of this this new you know uh	2925	B
yeah there's no prison space but you know you you come to the point where you have to you have to say either they're rehabilitatable or not	2925	B
uh you know and those that they that they that that clinically are nuts and out of their minds	2925	B
or those who have committed a murder who are who will do it again because_1 they've they've said you know when a person's murdered somebody out of cold blood the chances are they would do it again because they feel no remorse	2925	B
they need and i and i and i hate to say this because_1 i know it sounds awfully bad but they need to eliminate them_1	2925	B
they need to get them_1 out of society	2925	B
we can't tolerate it anymore we don't we we we flat don't have the space we don't have the money	2925	B
spend it on the ones who who do have a chance	2925	B
i- i mean i've i've heard of you know similar programs but to me i mean if	2925	B
i- and i you know and again i hate to say this but had they had they really hurt my family	2925	B
or whatever	2925	B
i would have stopped at nothing to ensure they were dead	2925	B
i and that and and i hate to say that but i- i mean it's it's just you they they violate your family of course at that point you don't have much to lose and i hate- and i- like i said i really hate to say that but i think that i would be that uh taken buy it	2925	B
yeah	2925	B
but the victims are the ones that are the criminals- are made the criminals i mean they're the ones that that end up hurting the worst	2925	B
and that that's really a shame but as far you know but as far as gun control goes i think that there needs- there definitely needs to be some measures taken because_1 not everybody's capable of owning- of owning and and taking care of a weapon	2925	B
and	2925	B
yeah	2925	B
you know it's hard to say that	2925	B
well there's not enough policemen	2925	B
no well there's not enough policeman	2925	B
or detectives or whatever you know and the people have to learn to	2925	B
to help themselves some they have by being extra careful	2925	B
uh by you know by knowing the signs of a crime- of a crime beginning to happen or whatever	2925	B
and and and frankly- frankly just reporting them_1 a lot of people don't- they they choose not to get involved when in fact they really should	2925	B
yeah well i mean lot of people say well i don't want to get involved because_1 then you know because_1 then if you know if they get off then they are going to come after me you know uh you know there's a lot- there's a lot of that well see to me i- i will never stand by	2925	B
i- i won't	2925	B
um-hum	2925	A
well i tell you i'm i'm for some really strong gun control measures but i mean that opens a lot of questions that i don't have any answers for	2925	A
it's like i'd i'd like to see a lot of controls um on it and because i would like uh i think	2925	A
the purpose- you know with a purpose- goal and a purpose in mind of seeing violence decrease in our society but uh how to get from here to there i'm not sure	2925	A
yeah yeah	2925	A
um-hum	2925	A
right	2925	A
yeah	2925	A
but i- i think what would happen though is that yes you would have a certain type of criminal a certain criminal element that would um	2925	A
be- be able to find a way to get the guns but i think in a lot of domestic uh disputes and a lot of family disputes um i'm not sure that those people would be able to get a hold of the guns	2925	A
you know in other words a a family that has a history say of physical abuse or physical violence but isn't the kind of family that's involved in criminal activities if if there were gun controls and that there just were not guns accessible to that type of family	2925	A
oh yeah	2925	A
yeah	2925	A
um-hum	2925	A
do you	2925	A
uh-huh	2925	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2925	A
uh-huh i know well that's the thing i'm not really sure if i want to um	2925	A
learn how to use one i'm not sure i could use one i i've thought a lot about this there was- something that came up that made me think a lot about it and i i'm not sure uh somebody was saying that you'd have to	2925	A
you know be able to pull the trigger in the end and i guess i always thought if it was threatening my personal safety or especially like my kids you know	2925	A
you have uh-huh	2925	A
oh my goodness	2925	A
you're kidding	2925	A
i can imagine	2925	A
yeah	2925	A
yeah	2925	A
um-hum	2925	A
yeah	2925	A
um-hum yeah	2925	A
but yeah that's the that is the thing see as in the past say five years i've evolved from thinking no i'm really i'm so much of pacifist that	2925	A
i would have to find another way to deal with the situation or deal with being victimized you know i couldn't use a gun hold on just a minute	2925	A
sorry we have kind of an open house and the sound really travels um	2925	A
uh-huh no	2925	A
yeah but i but i what i started to say is i've come to the point now where i'm thinking no i really want to take a self defense course and i want to take control over	2925	A
um you know my own defense and my own safety i- i- i think i'm just- i need to take responsibility- more responsibility for that than i do right now i think i just	2925	A
i allow myself to think well it will never happen to me or it won't happen to me- you know i'm not going to have to deal with that and i just i don't think that's it will i'm sure yeah	2925	A
yeah	2925	A
yeah	2925	A
oh boy	2925	A
um-hum	2925	A
um-hum	2925	A
um-hum	2925	A
wow	2925	A
wow	2925	A
right	2925	A
right	2925	A
holy smoke that's wild i was talking- again i was talking with somebody just last week and about- about crime in general i guess it's been on the news a lot lately and i guess- must be in the back of everybody's mind but i was saying	2925	A
if people around here think if they just get a better security system and a higher fence that you know they're going to take care of themselves and i said there's it's going to come to a point it	2925	A
where that you can't get a fence that's high enough and a security system that's good enough	2925	A
yeah because_1	2925	A
no kidding no i	2925	A
uh-huh	2925	A
oh that they can't do behind a	2925	A
that's something wow	2925	A
yeah well i can see how that might be now i mean you don't have to answer this or not if you don't want to because_1 i know it's a personal thing but with the crime that your family was involved in was- was there were there guns involved in that	2925	A
there were gosh	2925	A
that is really	2925	A
they weren't yeah um-hum	2925	A
um-hum	2925	A
really	2925	A
wow is he just crazy	2925	A
wow	2925	A
he has killed people and he's and he's out one person yeah	2925	A
yeah	2925	A
yeah yeah	2925	A
yeah if he could	2925	A
yeah	2925	A
gosh	2925	A
um-hum um-hum	2925	A
there's no prison space	2925	A
right you got to do one or the other	2925	A
um-hum	2925	A
um-hum	2925	A
um-hum	2925	A
um-hum	2925	A
gosh	2925	A
um-hum	2925	A
yeah i because we can't	2925	A
yeah	2925	A
have a chance	2925	A
did you did you hear about that um prison reform that's going up in Washington state or Oregon or someplace up there where they're taking criminals who are repeat offenders and i mean really repeat offenders	2925	A
that uh have raped several times or child molesters that have molested several children over and over again	2925	A
and they have put them in i don't even think they call it a police- a a prison but that's some kind of special it's a separate building	2925	A
in a separate location and they are just in there indefinitely they don't have any time when they are going to be released	2925	A
um-hum that-	2925	A
yeah	2925	A
yeah	2925	A
yeah i- i understand that	2925	A
no	2925	A
that's right	2925	A
that's right	2925	A
no i can understand- i- i- i can understand and respect that i have you know my own three kids and i	2925	A
i've i saw a story on TV about one time about a father who did take revenge on um someone who had hurt his children and and shot the guy and um i	2925	A
you know i remembered that that was years ago and i remember seeing that and and i really could understand where that was coming from	2925	A
yeah	2925	A
yep i i've heard that	2925	A
yeah	2925	A
and using it yeah and terrible accidents do happen when there's kids around	2925	A
but on the other hand you can't rely i mean the whole time i was growing up up until last five years i always thought well the police will handle it	2925	A
you know they'll get it under control and i just don't feel that way	2925	A
well- i don't feel that's true anymore they're not going to be able to handle it	2925	A
um-hum um-hum	2925	A
right	2925	A
right	2925	A
um-hum	2925	A
wow that would- that would be hard to understand	2925	A
oh yeah but still	2925	A
yeah you can't yeah	2925	A
how has your weather been recently	2978	A
record what	2978	A
oh wow that's something we've had a really wonderful Spring it's been rainy	2978	A
it's been comfortable it been cool and we've only had a couple of really severe weather storms uh which is unusual for northeast Texas generally we have some	2978	A
yeah last Thursday though it was just raining buckets	2978	A
and it was probably in the low eighties	2978	A
it was really a nice late Spring day very comfortable just really was nice had plenty of rain and within three days time	2978	A
all of that moisture is gone the sun has come out and it is H O T i mean big time hot the air conditioners in the buildings are saying oh no not again	2978	A
um-hum	2978	A
um-hum i can imagine well uh typically though what does your weather run when does your Spring actually start	2978	A
um-hum	2978	A
um-hum	2978	A
um-hum	2978	A
um-hum	2978	A
um-hum yeah	2978	A
oh wow	2978	A
right oh boy i know that- it's been about_1 eight years ago i guess now right here in Dallas	2978	A
i guess it was late May temperatures got up into the nineties and by early June it was rocking a hundred and it stayed that way till September	2978	A
we had ninety one consecutive hundred degree days	2978	A
and i didn't know whether we would survive at all oh but	2978	A
well actually you know we affect our humidity a great deal this at one time wasn't a real humid area	2978	A
but we've built a lot of lakes and a lot of reservoirs and that increases the relative humidity i mean it if it's there to evaporate it's going to go up into the air and the hotter it gets the more evaporates	2978	A
well we have attempted to reforest some areas but as a matter of fact at one time this was uh a very dense forest in this area and	2978	A
for farming and for construction and things a lot of the forests have been cut down and then of course you know they bulldozed a bunch of forest when they dug out the reservoir moisture	2978	A
but for the most part we have very mild Winters here we may get one snow storm i may actually see white on the ground one day	2978	A
but if it even ices over a half an inch worth of ice or just a little bit of snow man businesses close down traffic comes to a snarl i mean nothing happens if it gets enough snow you can see it on the ground	2978	A
um oh	2978	A
yeah	2978	A
uh-huh right	2978	A
right- yeah	2978	A
oh yeah	2978	A
that's true they sure do	2978	A
um-hum well you know the one of the things i have noticed is that the weather changes over time as well i was raised in Amarillo	2978	A
and i can remember when there was really only one snow storm a year in Amarillo it started in October and stopped in March or May- April and it you know there stayed snow on the ground all Winter long to to sun depth	2978	A
but actually that has changed considerably uh the the Winters are no less cold but they're dryer	2978	A
um-hum	2978	A
um-hum	2978	A
um-hum	2978	A
um-hum	2978	A
right	2978	A
oh wow that's something well i don't think there was a single day out this year for our kids they i don't they don't put ten in there i think they put three	2978	A
but good grief here three days for snow days actually one year before last they took a snow day because it was flooding uh Spring flood and they just couldn't get to school so they just canceled school	2978	A
so there's just too many we're in a a very uh they're low hills you don't notice them_1 because of the trees and because of the so many buildings built around but there's a lot of hills around here which means there's a lot of gullies which means there's a lot of creeks and a lot of flooding	2978	A
and uh that can create almost as big a hazard and i drive a little Nissan when it floods it drowns	2978	A
well yes uh anytime there's a storm there's going to be plenty of it yeah one of the	2978	A
uh-huh	2978	A
yeah	2978	A
right	2978	A
ooh goodness it really did climb fast didn't it	2978	A
well i am a little bit concerned this last week our temperatures not drop down below the upper seventies at night which means that you- you know we could be looking for a very warm Summer i really don't want that	2978	A
oh	2978	A
um	2978	A
oh my goodness	2978	A
um-hum	2978	A
that's right	2978	A
i agree	2978	A
well the last two weeks we have had records yes uh we've been- we've had between ninety and ninety five degree weather with about eighty six to eighty eight percent humidity	2978	B
yeah	2978	B
um-hum	2978	B
yeah i know what you mean by good hail storms	2978	B
hm	2978	B
um-hum hm	2978	B
oh yes i know unfortunately my air conditioner broke down uh two days ago so uh things have been like a sauna uh	2978	B
well it's pretty- Spring usually starts uh in May	2978	B
and we usually have seventy degree weather to seventy to eighty degree weather in May and in June and then uh toward the end of June it starts getting hot and uh hot	2978	B
meaning you know ninety and above i consider ninety and above hot uh and we usually have about the same humidity but unfortunately uh we had a very early Summer i'm- i'm hoping that we'll	2978	B
again maybe get some cool weather but uh i don't know uh it- it doesn't look very encouraging because they're calling for the rest of the week to be equally as hot so	2978	B
so	2978	B
hm	2978	B
oh my gracious wow	2978	B
oh i guess not that's you don't have as much humidity though do you uh	2978	B
um-hum	2978	B
right	2978	B
um probably put in more trees and things too uh might uh uh it seems like the area there more {treed} seemed to um uh hold the humidity in uh even more	2978	B
oh	2978	B
well don't feel bad it does here too and we get snow all the time uh they don't get that awfully much but they get enough unfortunately that uh uh if- if they aren't used to it it's not like having	2978	B
snow two you know uh three to five inches all the time or quite- quite often they seem to be able to handle it when they have it like that but here uh the schools close when there's half an inch of snow and uh	2978	B
everything else closes down so uh	2978	B
um-hum	2978	B
right	2978	B
right right yes it's been the same way here uh we haven't had nearly as severe uh a Winter in the last five years even	2978	B
than we had uh i've been in Maryland for twenty years so uh um i'd- i'd say when i first came here you know it- it was quite	2978	B
common to have several snows and uh you know they they build in uh ten snow days for our kids back here in the school and uh the last three years they haven't taken but one day	2978	B
so uh it has	2978	B
um-hum	2978	B
okay	2978	B
right	2978	B
right	2978	B
right right right	2978	B
ooh yes right you wouldn't wanna you wouldn't want to go through too many puddles do you have much uh many- many problems- problems with um lightning uh with electric storms there	2978	B
oh really okay because of that that's one thing that we have here see i'm originally from California so the contrast between	2978	B
the lightning storms i experienced there and the lightning storms back here where it hits in the back yard you know uh uh have been uh quite an experience but um	2978	B
uh we seem to have a lot this time of year we seem to have a lot of uh where it's still i mean last night it went down to sixty degrees but it's ninety it's it's eighty two right now here so uh yeah	2978	B
yes so it the the contrast in the Spring is so uh you know different i guess that it uh breeds some uh	2978	B
um-hum	2978	B
yeah	2978	B
but it went off in the whole neighborhood so uh uh it's this isn't uh	2978	B
this is still May it's not a real good time of year to start you know because uh uh it kind of looks for the but the the Summers have been longer and um hotter	2978	B
i think that a lot of it has to do with	2978	B
no as a matter of fact i understand we have one of the lowest crime rates in the area but then we aren't we're only a city of five thousand	2986	A
how's Richardson doing	2986	A
yes uh-huh	2986	A
um	2986	A
uh-huh well i wonder why it effects certain areas	2986	A
because i i i've lived in the Dallas area perhaps for about uh thirteen years now and i used to live in that not in that particular area but on that side of of Dallas	2986	A
and that was always a a fairly good area in there if i remember correctly	2986	A
but um i guess it moves in different uh areas at different times um	2986	A
the only problem that we have here are are you know just very minute sort of crime we have neighborhood crime watch programs and then the uh city police patrol the areas at least one a day	2986	A
and when you're not at home you're to notify your neighbors of course that you know you're going out of time et cetera et cetera and not do the things that are so obvious to uh potential	2986	A
uh-huh	2986	A
right	2986	A
but um	2986	A
other than that that's about the only thing we're doing in Sachse	2986	A
i think i saw on TV just this evening that there was a pregnant woman and and some members of her family killed was that over in Fort Worth	2986	A
hm	2986	A
is that right	2986	A
uh-huh	2986	A
uh-huh	2986	A
oh	2986	A
i wonder why over there i mean i'm glad it's not over here if you have to have it but um i don't understand why certain-	2986	A
uh-huh	2986	A
was it over in that area last year that they had the man um that was in the mall and this other man shot his wife	2986	A
in in the mall area she and she was screaming and heading towards the entrance to the mall and they shot her	2986	A
and then there was a man in the um parking lot and he pulled out a gun that he had in his car and he shot the the guy was that over in	2986	A
oh oh that was Redbird	2986	A
hm	2986	A
as a matter of fact this summer early- early- actually earlier this spring i had gone to Collin Creek mall and my hubcaps were stolen	2986	A
and the police officer told me that um	2986	A
the- the malls are a very good area where these people like to go and steal the hubcaps they just steal one side	2986	A
and and take off	2986	A
did they	2986	A
well- i don't know whether that's a faddish thing or what	2986	A
and then it costs us so much to uh replace those things uh-huh yeah surely	2986	A
uh-huh	2986	A
uh-huh	2986	A
and your deductible of course doesn't mean that it's it's under that it's it's normally	2986	A
yeah i don't know	2986	A
um i really don't know what else to say	2986	A
does that about cover it	2986	A
okay	2986	A
uh-huh about the only thing you do is is to provide the um protection in your own home and then be careful when you do go out at night if you go out at night	2986	A
and um certainly that's about the best thing we can do and uh	2986	A
they have any laws against that sort of thing	2986	A
uh-huh	2986	A
oh really	2986	A
um	2986	A
um	2986	A
that's quite a lot of money isn't it	2986	A
and it gives other i imagine other uh potential crime people uh ideas too	2986	A
uh-huh	2986	A
i imagine they're going to need more police officers too	2986	A
if they do that	2986	A
yeah i guess that's true	2986	A
well even here in Sachse we have one undercover police car	2986	A
and actually if we	2986	A
had to call him a few times and they're usually on the spot in about five minutes	2986	A
course as i say we're a small town yeah	2986	A
yeah at least they're there	2986	A
so well i've enjoyed talking to you	2986	A
okay have a good evening bye-bye	2986	A
well crime's not very bad out there	2986	B
uh-huh	2986	B
right	2986	B
it's been a lot worse this year	2986	B
um	2986	B
they have a lot of drug dealers over on you know where Spring Valley is and Coit	2986	B
it's real bad there has been for a few years especially on the Dallas side	2986	B
Dallas is just across the street and	2986	B
and uh they've closed down a bunch of apartment complexes and uh	2986	B
you know	2986	B
like that and they're having to crime sweep	2986	B
uh-huh	2986	B
yeah it used to be	2986	B
right get someone to pick up your papers and your mail	2986	B
set your lights on timers and	2986	B
yeah	2986	B
uh-huh the murder rate really seems to be up in Fort Worth and Dallas well especially Dallas last year in Fort Worth this year	2986	B
uh-huh	2986	B
yeah this morning uh-huh	2986	B
and apparently they already they already caught him or they're talking about somebody else they're talking about two million dollar bond for somebody	2986	B
yeah i never i never heard all of the story about that i just heard it from people at work and on the radio uh a little bit	2986	B
it's really been	2986	B
Fort Worth has really been bad because of the kidnappings and all the armed robberies	2986	B
i i think i think that um they're just getting well they had that crazy person that kidnapped the	2986	B
the woman and took her all they way to Saint Louis before they were caught you know	2986	B
and she called the FBI	2986	B
oh i i think that was Redbird	2986	B
yeah it's real bad too	2986	B
everywhere there's a mall there's bad crime though	2986	B
yeah	2986	B
yeah	2986	B
yeah exactly uh-huh	2986	B
they stole the emblem off of one of mine	2986	B
yeah	2986	B
apparently	2986	B
from the insurance and yeah	2986	B
they also they tear off the hood ornaments too and one of them costs thirty dollars so	2986	B
right	2986	B
that's right	2986	B
uh-huh	2986	B
yeah i think so	2986	B
i mean and they said take what steps and we already discussed that you know you know	2986	B
right	2986	B
yeah i work at Valley View and they have horse patrols and um and they have the mall security that that drives around	2986	B
probably around the mall at least once every ten minutes at night especially because they have so many stolen cars and they've had um	2986	B
three three armed robberies of uh jewelry stores	2986	B
and uh and they've all been in the middle of the day	2986	B
you know	2986	B
and uh one of them was three hundred thousand dollars	2986	B
yeah really is	2986	B
but i've seen they've stepped up security quite a bit	2986	B
and the police are around a lot more now so	2986	B
yeah	2986	B
then they use they use undercover too	2986	B
uh-huh	2986	B
right uh-huh	2986	B
oh yeah	2986	B
small town but still you know	2986	B
right	2986	B
yeah it's nice talking to you	2986	B
you too bye-bye	2986	B
well i guess it depends on what age i'm in the thirty something so i know i mean i lived through it uh are you old enough to know about the war	2955	B
oh	2955	B
okay well yeah you're old enough but it was on the fringe	2955	B
it ended when i was in uh college in uh	2955	B
when i turned nineteen in nineteen seventy i can't even remember at this point um when i turned nineteen it was the year that uh the draft was still going on if i had been a male or in Israel i'd have been number two	2955	B
yeah so i learned a lesson in gender um in terms of the war i don't know um	2955	B
see actually i don't really know that much about it i just know socially the impact it had here and what you hear in the media you know um i guess i think it was not that great that we were in there	2955	B
um in terms of for how long it lasted	2955	B
you know what do you think	2955	B
um-hum	2955	B
um-hum	2955	B
right the devastation yeah	2955	B
um-hum	2955	B
yeah and in full faction yeah	2955	B
yeah it just kind of dragged on um i don't know how you were historically but i was- was a little bit older before i realized just how long it had been going on since LBJ and i mean i had- yeah	2955	B
it really well yeah in fact because_1 in terms of when your	2955	B
there's at least ten years between us so in terms of when you were in school i'm sure that it was you know the majority of your high school and junior high years um	2955	B
one of the things i didn't like was the weapon the weapons i can't even say it the weaponry that- systems that they used um it just didn't seem that um	2955	B
i don't know technically we knew what we were doing either then you heard about the things like agent orange et cetera and you'd think	2955	B
you know just uh how could the government or the Pentagon uh whomever- whomever's in charge there been so careless	2955	B
um	2955	B
conscious yeah	2955	B
Nutrisweet yeah and all these other things that's true uh	2955	B
um monetarily too i just don't think we've done enough for the uh Vietnamese people as a whole um in South Vietnam in general in helping them restore themselves	2955	B
you know and i don't know if it's because_1 there aren't any oil fields there	2955	B
yeah i mean i don't think they do but i just think it's kind of a shame that uh you still hear things about the children that are orphans there and um so on a whole i don't know war isn't good and that one i probably um	2955	B
my main opinion would be we shouldn't have done it	2955	B
well that's what i know about the Vietnam War unless you have	2955	B
um-hum	2955	B
um-hum	2955	B
um-hum oh Vietnam	2955	B
jeez yeah	2955	B
um-hum and that that	2955	B
uh-huh	2955	B
in terms of the personal yeah the bitterness is more on a personal level than on a	2955	B
uh-huh	2955	B
the money's after yeah i mean i think it started actually like like in the late fifties i mean like in fifty eight fifty nine	2955	B
so it really i mean because_1 i know in nineteen sixty three i mean i was nine years old when Kennedy was shot	2955	B
so i mean i remember um right around then that that's when i first started hearing about Vietnam but then as i got older and studied in school i realized it was even going on before that	2955	B
you know and you think to yourself oh my goodness Eisenhower that sounds ancient yeah and i know i know you know a lot of the Vietnam vets that are my age in their later thirties um guys that i know that	2955	B
they're just kind of bitter you know they they you know i hate to quote- that movie Born on the Fourth of July but it's that kind of idea	2955	B
you know they just don't feel that socially they were given like a friend of mine called it the yellow ribbon syndrome yeah they weren't given the yeah so	2955	B
well i won't keep you anymore that's probably about as much as we both but thanks for talking to me okay ah yes is that where you're at	2955	B
oh i know where that is that's beautiful where you're at	2955	B
DC yeah are you a native of there	2955	B
yeah uh Dallas it is uh ninety two degrees here today but at least the humidity is uh below forty percent which makes it kind of like Phoenix	2955	B
really	2955	B
well you yeah well you're not missing too much then	2955	B
really well take it easy okay bye-bye	2955	B
um just barely yeah i'm uh twenty nine so uh	2955	A
yes but just uh yeah exactly had some friends over that were that were in it	2955	A
really	2955	A
wowie	2955	A
uh-huh	2955	A
right	2955	A
um-hum	2955	A
well i think it's uh basically the same way it's certainly has affected uh US policy though there's no question it had an overwhelming effect of how we approached the the thing in uh Iraq	2955	A
because_1 uh the whole thing that was bad about Vietnam was no different from Iraq i mean it was uh one country picking on a smaller weaker one	2955	A
yeah the only difference was that the government said okay if we're going to support this smaller country then we're going to support it a hundred percent and we're going to consider ourselves against in war against these people as well	2955	A
which uh right which really wasn't the attitude with Vietnam it was sort of a president's war rather than a country's war	2955	A
right yeah it seemed to me like it was it seemed like it was going on forever yeah	2955	A
um-hum	2955	A
yeah	2955	A
right	2955	A
yeah right	2955	A
of course now uh now everyone's more uh you know environmentally uh intelligent than they were back then i mean back then it wasn't commonly known that saccharin was bad for you and all these other things that people	2955	A
that people know about themselves now	2955	A
um-hum	2955	A
yeah i don't know if they uh i don't know if they have that resource or not	2955	A
yeah	2955	A
right	2955	A
yeah yeah well you know a little uh a little bit more than i do explain it said i didn't uh get to live through it that the people that i know that it did	2955	A
uh felt very strongly most of i work for a government contractor so most of the guys i work with are uh well at least some of the guys i work with rather are veterans	2955	A
and uh from Vietnam and i haven't talked to any of them that that weren't you know glad that they went or or rather thought that the reason they went was a good one	2955	A
you know most of them are very very strongly that that the reason for America to be there was a good one they just felt that the way America backed them up wasn't wasn't at all right	2955	A
yeah in term of	2955	A
yeah personal level and and the finances how they started you know like air attacks and stuff like that dropped off like crazy because_1 the Congress wouldn't approve you know yeah	2955	A
um i- i	2955	A
um-hum	2955	A
yeah	2955	A
yeah right	2955	A
uh-huh	2955	A
right right the ticker tape parade and all that	2955	A
okay	2955	A
yes uh were you calling from Texas	2955	A
no i'm in Falls Church Virginia	2955	A
yeah right- right near DC	2955	A
ah pretty much yep been	2955	A
yeah it's about the same weather here little bit little bit cooler like eighty nine but basically the same thing	2955	A
yeah right	2955	A
okay bye-bye	2955	A
well um	2985	B
i'm in my i i i've seen the changes i think in my generation most of all because i'm a early baby boomer	2985	B
and uh i was brought up	2985	B
uh to sort of get married and raise children and uh be very domestic	2985	B
and uh when i went to college or went to high school i did very well i was urged to become a secretary or a teacher because those are typical roles	2985	B
and uh things have changed and	2985	B
i i've ventured off in all sorts of areas and so have most of the other women in my generation	2985	B
and we're all in business or	2985	B
the professions and uh and uh heavens we're we're uh	2985	B
astronauts and things like that who know who would wouldn't have been imagined in nineteen sixty eight or something	2985	B
how about you	2985	B
yes	2985	B
yes	2985	B
another thing that happened that i found is that you know when i got married i didn't know anybody who had ever been divorced or or when i was younger i didn't know anybody who had ever been divorced	2985	B
in this day and age people are as likely to get divorced as to stay married	2985	B
and very often the woman has to be able to earn a decent living	2985	B
and uh so there's an additional reason for her to be capable of holding down a good job	2985	B
yes	2985	B
i i agree with that and i also think that they're taking a lead in in the arts and in business too	2985	B
and uh	2985	B
as as the years go by they run surveys to see how many women are CEOs or on the boards of major companies and the number is creeping up very	2985	B
slowly but it's definitely increasing so that probably ten years from now	2985	B
yes it is i mean ten- fifteen ten fifteen years ago there were no women	2985	B
on the boards or or or CEO's of major corporations unless they inherited the firm from their father you know that sort of thing	2985	B
but right if it was a family owned business but now they're they're in the board room and they're trying to get ahead	2985	B
and make it in the business world of course to some extent the laws are helping them	2985	B
but uh uh you know there's no no no holding back their ambition on the other hand what it does to the fabric of society and the family remains to be seen	2985	B
i i i	2985	B
well i think that in a way they're they're being tested right now we're going through a testing period	2985	B
where capability is is everything and if	2985	B
they succeed then the the the generation of girls that are growing up now will have it much easier	2985	B
because there will be a precedent they'll have had role models whereas you know the generation that grew up in the sixties and seventies	2985	B
sorry	2985	B
yes	2985	B
yes	2985	B
um i guess just by virtue of living longer in a way you're right because they do it does- does come to them but they've got to be young enough to enjoy it i mean if they're just	2985	B
old ladies sitting around waiting for the end to come it doesn't do them much good	2985	B
yes	2985	B
well i'm in the middle of the country and and it seems to me they could- they start their from start from both coasts and work their ways inward	2985	B
uh one of the one of the things that that i'm finding is that i've lived	2985	B
in Texas i've lived in New York and uh i	2985	B
have i've done a lot of visiting out in California and i know that we're lagging behind here and yet i really do see	2985	B
uh women's roles have increased and they're gaining new respect in fact	2985	B
i believe that the mayor of the top five major Texas cities	2985	B
are all women	2985	B
and that goes back to your original point about politics	2985	B
so uh uh you know it's going to get to a point i some men are going to wonder if they're falling behind	2985	B
yes	2985	B
i think the young people today do have an open mind it's just not as much	2985	B
uh	2985	B
typecasting by sex- by gender	2985	B
uh	2985	B
you know uh a little girl can say i want to be an astronaut or i want to be a fireman or a policeman or	2985	B
or a Rhodes scholar which was impossible when i was going to college uh Rhodes	2985	B
okay can you uh give me your thoughts on what	2985	A
women's roles are or how they've changed	2985	A
yeah well i was kind of same thing it's you know i was i was brought up in a small town and and women tended to just get married and take care of the house	2985	A
um but as as times changed	2985	A
um the price of things i guess started rising and it took more than one income	2985	A
so more- um more and more	2985	A
of young women were staying in school they were getting a better education and they were going out into the work force	2985	A
yeah	2985	A
yeah i think perhaps uh um years ago it was a stigma	2985	A
on a family to have a divorce in it	2985	A
and whether it was warranted or not people just stayed together because of what the family thought uh	2985	A
people little bit smarter today than that they uh uh yes there's a family unit and it's and it's very difficult if there uh are children especially young children	2985	A
but in a lot of cases it's probably it would probably more difficult if they stayed together	2985	A
but uh i think women are taking a uh a more active role in politics i i think that uh	2985	A
within the next ten or fifteen years you'll probably see a woman vice president or a woman president	2985	A
and you'll also see a lot more uh congressmen and senators uh women	2985	A
is that right you think they you think that's the case	2985	A
oh yeah if it was if it was a family owned business you mean	2985	A
yeah i still- i still think it's it's uh it's a two tiered system i uh	2985	A
i know of of uh women engineers and and	2985	A
uh supervisors that are	2985	A
uh they have to work twice as hard it seems like to achieve the same levels that a male does	2985	A
uh i don't know if that's just my imagination or not but it seems to be that's uh	2985	A
the ones that are up there	2985	A
uh seem to have a little bit more intelligence than their counterparts	2985	A
if there was if it was up to me i think i would have uh more females because it seems like they try harder	2985	A
right they'll have role models they'll have protectors	2985	A
they'll have protectors	2985	A
uh there'll be more and more women that are up higher and higher	2985	A
um	2985	A
and also they say that the bulk of the wealth	2985	A
is controlled by women now	2985	A
uh just through i guess uh uh	2985	A
the men dying off and just leaving their uh fortunes to women	2985	A
so that's going to have a big impact uh	2985	A
if you've got money and brains you can you can wield a lot of power	2985	A
yeah	2985	A
yeah	2985	A
it must be the culture's different uh down there than up here also	2985	A
um they're kind of uh	2985	A
the old Yankees	2985	A
you know it it takes uh uh it takes a stick of dynamite to get them moving off center in a lot of cases	2985	A
where uh uh	2985	A
the Midwest i think is a little bit more aggressive because they're closer to the west coast	2985	A
where they're uh highly aggressive	2985	A
you know uh ideas and or it seems like new ideas start out there and then kind of work their way east i don't know if you've found that to be true	2985	A
um	2985	A
yeah	2985	A
uh-huh	2985	A
the uh	2985	A
i think the only problem there is the men that themselves that feel threatened by by a woman	2985	A
uh by her intelligence probably	2985	A
uh those are the ones that you're going to have problems with i think uh	2985	A
a lot of the at least my kids they seem to have a a more open mind	2985	A
today than uh like when i was growing up	2985	A
right	2985	A
um are you what- what type of music do you like	2923	B
oh well then i'm sure we're going to have a lot in common i'm just joking what exactly is cutting edge rock	2923	B
oh really um-hum	2923	B
um-hum	2923	B
um-hum	2923	B
i see	2923	B
um-hum	2923	B
is it music that um like you can understand the words to	2923	B
oh okay well the the thing that i hate really is music that um	2923	B
it just seems like instruments playing all at once to five different scores of music do you know what i mean like didn't seem like it was meant what	2923	B
yeah it's noise- it just doesn't seem like it was supposed to be played at the same time together or that someone isn't tuned or whatever	2923	B
but um i have to admit i do love top forty	2923	B
and um	2923	B
although i don't watch MTV i do love that type of music but	2923	B
i feel like it's the best music that you can sing along to and dance and	2923	B
and um i'm an aerobics freak so i just uh i love that type of music to do aerobics to and exercise and that sort of thing	2923	B
do you go out to listen to music a lot	2923	B
um-hum	2923	B
don't get much time	2923	B
um-hum	2923	B
um-hum	2923	B
do you play any sort of instrument oh	2923	B
oh don't be silly i used to play the piano and i used to play the guitar but	2923	B
then when i moved out you don't get to take the piano with you and uh there's- no guitar around so i decided just to turn on the radio and that'll be my musical entertainment from now on	2923	B
but we don't get to go i love concerts if i could i would save my money and just go to concerts but	2923	B
obviously not only is they don't come around Rochester too often but um standing in line for hours on end doesn't really appeal to me either	2923	B
yeah exactly	2923	B
i know and then by the time you leave you end up like sitting in your car for an hour just to get out of the parking lot	2923	B
do you have a good um stadium there or or	2923	B
oh right what's it called	2923	B
oh Reunion no that's not what i'm thinking of wasn't	2923	B
i don't know what i'm thinking of	2923	B
oh	2923	B
um-hum	2923	B
um-hum	2923	B
yeah	2923	B
well now you have to like the Beatles and Billy Joel you know uh	2923	B
um-hum	2923	B
sort of grown out of that	2923	B
um-hum	2923	B
um-hum	2923	B
like who are some of those bands what are they called	2923	B
who won't get you in too much trouble	2923	B
um-hum	2923	B
um-hum	2923	B
um-hum	2923	B
well you know i was just reading the newspaper and um there's this big thing on Madonna's new movie Truth of Dare have you heard about that	2923	B
and um well i haven't seen the movie but obviously it looks extremely risque and um	2923	B
they were just mentioning some figures that she's made like in the past year she made thirty nine million dollars and over the past couple of years it's totaled almost two hundred million dollars	2923	B
and i mean as much as i like top forty i don't like Madonna i don't like her and i don't like her music and um i just don't like anything about her actually	2923	B
um-hum	2923	B
probably yeah	2923	B
um-hum right exactly	2923	B
um-hum	2923	B
yeah that's true	2923	B
but i know oh God no but to think that she's able to make that much money	2923	B
just think of i mean that is what our kids are growing up with right now you know that they- that they were talking about how Madonna is becoming a role model for kids	2923	B
and uh boy it's really scary	2923	B
i don't know but i guess i i still go back to the old faithfuls like James Taylor and if i could- if i had my choice to sit and listen to um	2923	B
oh i don't know some new group of today or just uh	2923	B
put on a tape of i don't know	2923	B
Carly Simon or whatever that's probably what i would stick to	2923	B
although i do have uh a an unending love for fifties music which you probably detest	2923	B
um-hum	2923	B
um-hum	2923	B
um-hum	2923	B
um-hum yeah	2923	B
um-hum	2923	B
me either	2923	B
yeah do you have uh any sort of collection are you like uh you know do you go out and buy a bunch of CD's or tapes or	2923	B
do you really	2923	B
yeah exactly they really have	2923	B
we were talking about um how the only way to really destroy a CD is to drill a hole through it that you can microwave them_1 and uh i don't know do whatever really it amazes- yeah amazing	2923	B
but well it was nice talking to you	2923	B
yeah right and i'll go turn on my James Taylor tape or something all righty take care bye-bye	2923	B
great	2923	A
uh i like uh	2923	A
probably cutting edge rock would be the best way to describe it	2923	A
good deal	2923	A
cutting edge rock oh i don't know you got your top forty rock which i just can't stand top forty music the stuff you'd see on MTV and VH One and what have you and then there's new music come from we've got a radio station down here that uh	2923	A
started broadcasting about a year ago and they've uh they play music that you just wouldn't hear on any other radio station more like a college- it's more like a college station would play	2923	A
which we don't have down here but uh	2923	A
it's just music by different groups it's you know things you you wouldn't you wouldn't uh	2923	A
you wouldn't would never be exposed to	2923	A
yeah most of it	2923	A
yeah	2923	A
kind of noise	2923	A
it's noise	2923	A
well	2923	A
yeah yeah	2923	A
do i go out to listen to music well i go to school and work so i don't get too too many opportunities to uh go out and see a a live band although occasionally	2923	A
i'll go downtown they have what they call Deep Ellum down here where a lot of local bands play and i've gone down there a few times	2923	A
no i'm musically destitute	2923	A
have no talents	2923	A
right	2923	A
yeah yeah i used to go i when i first moved to Dallas several years ago i've gone to a few concerts but it just	2923	A
it just gets to be more of a hassle than it's worth yeah you get a lot of thirteen and fourteen year olds and it's just a crowd of little kids	2923	A
yeah we usually go down and there's a tower that they have downtown you go down have a couple of drinks and wait for traffic to go away	2923	A
it's	2923	A
it's an indoor arena	2923	A
Reunion	2923	A
there's one there's the Bronco Bowl that's out in Fort Worth though	2923	A
Arlington Stadium	2923	A
there's several big things down in down here most of the most of the concerts are out at uh Reunion Arena	2923	A
and it's it's okay the the acoustics could be better but like i say i haven't been down there to a concert since	2923	A
jeez i don't remember who i went to see last	2923	A
i like the Beatles some Billy Joel you know back in high school i guess i was a big Billy Joel fan but	2923	A
i've been	2923	A
well you know i listen to it but i won't go buy it	2923	A
i've i've like i've been exposed to so many new and different bands lately just through this new radio station that	2923	A
i realize there's just a lot of a lot of things i've i never would have heard or even thought of looking at or listening to	2923	A
and	2923	A
oh i'm trying to think of a good example one that won't get me into too much trouble	2923	A
um	2923	A
yeah	2923	A
be a bad example like for example the Violent- Violent Femmes they've been around for a while and they've just started playing some new music of theirs and it made me go out and buy some and listen to it i won't say i like the whole album really but uh	2923	A
um-hum	2923	A
yeah i was reading an article about that yesterday	2923	A
the only thing i like about Madonna is i think if if i was given a ticket to see her perform i think she'd be entertaining to see perform	2923	A
but i don't i don't really care for her music there's one or two songs that i like you know for a while until they overplayed them_1 to death but uh i've never been a big Madonna fan	2923	A
but i do think if someone gave me a ticket it'd be a really entertaining show	2923	A
i wouldn't go stand in line or sleep overnight at the	2923	A
yeah	2923	A
that's crazy	2923	A
some no there's some my parents you know i used to listen to the stuff they listen to you know the Guess Who and what have you i've got some of that uh i don't i don't	2923	A
listening to so	2923	A
i'm i've got pretty broad musical tastes i don't really care for gospel and i'm not a big country fan but	2923	A
other than that i'll listen to just about anything	2923	A
yeah i've got some- i've got i don't know about a hundred hundred and fifteen CD's i suppose	2923	A
i just i've got a bunch of the albums but i never play them_1 because	2923	A
CD's have taken over	2923	A
yeah	2923	A
you can scratch them_1 up pretty good they'll still play	2923	A
yes so go out and play in that sun	2923	A
all right	2923	A
okay bye	2923	A
there you go	2995	A
oh well people that call on the phone all the time to try to sell you something	2995	A
you know that that try to sell you the newspaper and uh what carpet cleaning and uh	2995	A
what else roof repair	2995	A
uh	2995	A
and enough well i think it's a waste of paper the people that always leave uh	2995	A
junk mail and	2995	A
because um you just end up throwing it away most of the time	2995	A
probably eighty percent of the the junk mail that you get is is um	2995	A
something that you don't need	2995	A
and the same way with those calls	2995	A
what is it oh MCI MCI really does even when you tell them no they keep calling back	2995	A
MCI it's the long distance telephone company	2995	A
um-hum well they won't- they won't take a no for an answer here for some reason	2995	A
they just keep calling back	2995	A
um-hum	2995	A
uh-huh	2995	A
uh	2995	A
yeah	2995	A
um-hum	2995	A
oh yeah um-hum	2995	A
right	2995	A
um-hum	2995	A
um-hum	2995	A
um-hum	2995	A
you can't force them to be	2995	A
no	2995	A
uh-huh	2995	A
oh yeah	2995	A
because they follow them_1 around twenty four hours a day	2995	A
and you know they do Ted Kennedy	2995	A
of course he's breaking the law all the time so it's a different story then	2995	A
you know but but Ed McMahon i mean you know who cares about Ed McMahon	2995	A
he's probably hasn't done anything interesting in the last thirty years that they've been on the air	2995	A
you know and he has a chauffeur maybe he drinks but he never drives a car either you know it's not the same with Johnny Carson	2995	A
um-hum	2995	A
without your and without your permission um-hum	2995	A
right	2995	A
oh good	2995	A
um-hum	2995	A
um-hum	2995	A
that's right	2995	A
um-hum	2995	A
well you have to have the telephone but	2995	A
you can't you know and and it's sometimes it's hard to screen out all the calls that you don't want	2995	A
um-hum	2995	A
um	2995	A
um-hum	2995	A
hm uh-hum	2995	A
right um-hum	2995	A
sometimes yeah some days it just rings off the wall	2995	A
no no uh-huh	2995	A
um-hum	2995	A
right	2995	A
yeah	2995	A
even if i guess it's for coupons they they have a survey they run	2995	A
and it i guess it one of them is supposed to be a smokers survey but the questions go a lot farther than having to do anything with smoking	2995	A
and they ask that you know they start out and they ask you even even to your income level i think that's you know	2995	A
whether you buy a TV dinner or not i don't think it has anything to do with what-	2995	A
what do you think invades your privacy	2995	B
MCI what's that	2995	B
oh now see i- i really don't have much trouble with	2995	B
i just say no thank you and hang up	2995	B
i had a carpet service call up three times	2995	B
all within in an hour but	2995	B
i uh i do telemarketing	2995	B
so uh i'm very polite and i just say no thank you and say no thank you very politely and i hang up and	2995	B
don't bother me after that	2995	B
so i think the only thing that really bothers me	2995	B
is if	2995	B
when somebody contacts me and	2995	B
i didn't feel they had a right to know how many bedrooms were in my house even	2995	B
that i think is my invasion privacy because it's the government	2995	B
and i don't understand what their need to know is	2995	B
and i think that is my biggest objection to anything as far as	2995	B
invading my privacy if somebody wants personal information out of me	2995	B
but telephone calls	2995	B
i figure they don't bother me one way or the other	2995	B
uh i know when i do telemarketing um	2995	B
i'm a soft person if if someone says i am not interested i'll just say fine and back out	2995	B
and i make very good sales but i'm not uh as i said	2995	B
i'm not half as pushy as these people because i don't really care i mean	2995	B
if if they're not interested fine you know that's it	2995	B
right	2995	B
and i'm not pushing something down their throat that uh i don't think is a good item anyway that i don't think i could do anyway	2995	B
but i feel like oh movie stars or sure it's part of their	2995	B
i guess they're	2995	B
portray being a movie star they get themselves in these rag sheets but uh	2995	B
i think they go too far i think that's invasion of privacy	2995	B
yeah oh yeah	2995	B
no i think my seriously my classification of of	2995	B
invasion of privacy is trying to get personal information	2995	B
and putting it falsely out or just bombarding me for the answers	2995	B
right	2995	B
this to me is is my invasion of privacy	2995	B
anytime i can honestly say no or	2995	B
throw the paper away or but you can always write to uh	2995	B
oh i forgot the name of it and stop the junk mail that i've done	2995	B
because_1 i don't want junk mail anyway so i wrote to them when it came on the air so i don't get any of that bull that it works by the way	2995	B
but uh the telephone doesn't bother me because_1 i leave it half the time on uh	2995	B
you know answering service anyway unless i'm home	2995	B
so i figure i can turn it off one way or the other but	2995	B
i think that's the only bottom line thing that i dislike	2995	B
because it does other than the U S Census um what was it	2995	B
oh the the carpet place that called me three times	2995	B
that i felt was invasion because it was the same carpet place and called me three times	2995	B
i mean one should be sufficient	2995	B
but if people don't use the telephone it's like i don't know when the police has their	2995	B
project going and i don't know when the other ones have their project going and when they want to pick up down my street for things that's the only way i know	2995	B
and uh that's it	2995	B
well see there's no way of knowing that's you know that's the problem like the product i sell	2995	B
uh i sell mostly to older people which can't get it in a normal public situation	2995	B
the only way we'd get to them_1 is by telephone	2995	B
and uh most of them like it because the company i work for is nationwide	2995	B
and uh reputable and they know that hey we're backing it one hundred percent	2995	B
but if we were denied the right to call people up these people would never be able to get it	2995	B
because your normal companies that offer it do not offer it in the amounts that we do and they'd never have it then at that point	2995	B
because we offer it in a very low you know quantity	2995	B
so i mean i i don't know what to do as far as that's concerned but it is nerve racking	2995	B
i mean it is nerve racking to have the telephone but at least as i said	2995	B
you can always say no thank you	2995	B
i gather you get a lot of telephone calls	2995	B
yes yes yes in other words you own your own home	2995	B
i think that's where they hit most of us like i own my own home	2995	B
and you just know about what time like some days i hate staying home because the phone rings all the time	2995	B
but uh i don't know i haven't been able to figure that out something else to do about it	2995	B
when they call up and want to say well tell me this this this this and i'll give you a free something or another	2995	B
my answer is no thank you i don't need it and they say well don't you want to know what's free and i say no	2995	B
if i have to give them so much to answer the questions to get fifty rolls of film or something like that	2995	B
they're taking something away from me and i don't like that	2995	B
uh-huh	2995	B
okay um	2951	A
do you want to start	2951	A
do you have a	2951	A
um-hum	2951	A
um-hum	2951	A
so you never let it run up on you	2951	A
that is wonderful that is wonderful i'm uh i- i kind of uh	2951	A
uh i'm just do very- you know just just all depends that it when i have everything all paid off and then i start wanting something and i don't really have enough well don't have enough in savings savings- you know like for a big purchase	2951	A
then uh sometimes i- i uh lose sight of it you know it's it just- it is just is easy to use	2951	A
and then uh after a while i- i am like you i hate paying those people interest and then i make-	2951	A
i make i- i added like uh uh wrote uh an addition to to my car loan through the credit union which i knew was lower interest just to pay them_1 all off and then i swore i would never use them again	2951	A
um-hum	2951	A
the only thing is you have to make sure that you don't charge more than you know you are going to be able to pay	2951	A
at a given time and	2951	A
yeah and the problem- the problem is especially with young people is they they want things now they don't want to have to wait for them_1 and credit cards are the way to do that	2951	A
and then then they're in trouble	2951	A
um-hum	2951	A
i have a i have a friend who uh	2951	A
well she is old enough to know better but uh she she did it and she got really in bad shape she ended up going into bankruptcy	2951	A
and Palley Royal is her downfall and there is no limit on those things	2951	A
they just let you come and spend and you know run it up run it up so i don't know	2951	A
Palley Palley Royal	2951	A
uh-huh	2951	A
i- i do not know if i don't know if it is local	2951	A
no Palley Royal	2951	A
i know i know a lot of people who uh some gals- some ladies at work who don't have any problems with money or anything but they they really love Palley Royal	2951	A
so you know they it is just hard- you know you got stay away or else you might end up you just can't help yourself and buy	2951	A
self-control is the key my daughter has my daughter is twenty and she got a Sears credit card when she was about eighteen	2951	A
and uh Christmas before last she and her boyfriend her boyfriend had gotten one too i believe	2951	A
and they gave some of the most wonderful gifts to everyone in their family i mean they spent lots of money on they gave each other these beautiful things they gave stuff to all of us and we were going	2951	A
i can't believe you all did this you should not have done this and they got angry and said	2951	A
we wanted to do it	2951	A
okay now- she is still paying on that Sears charge she has now you know she's learned and she she is uh definitely paying it off paying- paying on it and not running it back up but you can't tell them_1	2951	A
that's right	2951	A
um-hum	2951	A
the only good thing- one good thing about credit cards though uh especially in business if you	2951	A
uh you have to	2951	A
you know you are going to be reimbursed by your company	2951	A
and then uh in fact i know of a man who is in uh	2951	A
he is in a he he he he well- he he is in an oil pipe	2951	A
pipe line selling kind of a thing and he has to	2951	A
he has to live on credit cards and then he gets commission you know later on but if he did not have credit cards he could not exist because_1 a lot of those you know because_1 he knows	2951	A
six weeks down the road he is probably you know he is going to get the money to pay for it but he really does so sometimes i think	2951	A
um-hum	2951	A
that's true	2951	A
oh yeah	2951	A
yeah	2951	A
um-hum that is true	2951	A
that's really true	2951	A
right uh you know like emergencies or something that you do not have the ready cash- that you do not have cash and you have to	2951	A
your car breaks down or you have to you have to have something	2951	A
it's a real it's you know you do not have the money in savings so it really is a lifesaver at times when you do have to use it but	2951	A
but like you say use it wisely	2951	A
only in you know when you really have to or knowing that you are going to pay it off every every month	2951	A
so that is that is something about American Express if you only use American Express you do not have a choice	2951	A
you're kidding	2951	A
and they were knowing they were going to go into bankruptcy	2951	A
so they it was planned	2951	A
oh no right	2951	A
yeah	2951	A
yeah me too really	2951	A
well i guess we covered it	2951	A
do you have any do you have anything else you want to add	2951	A
well if you have got any other thoughts	2951	A
throw them_1 out	2951	A
well thank you Catherine bye	2951	A
well credit cards um i think- think they are wonderful but um	2951	B
i think you have to have a lot of restraint	2951	B
um i have never been in trouble with credit cards but uh my youngest daughter is and a friend of mine is and i think it is terrible	2951	B
that they can uh you know wipe out a max in uh such a short time	2951	B
uh i never pay interest charges i value my money too much to uh line somebody else's pockets with my money	2951	B
and i always um pay it off before um i am charged any interest on my balance	2951	B
never	2951	B
um-hum	2951	B
um um-hum	2951	B
um-hum	2951	B
right you really have to show a lot of restraint but if you look at if you look at the time frame on that uh you will find that you have about six or seven weeks	2951	B
before you have to make that payment back to the credit card company without being charged any interest	2951	B
that's correct yeah you	2951	B
um-hum	2951	B
your budget has to be so that you can uh	2951	B
you know summarize what your balance is going to be at a particular time and i can do that	2951	B
that's right	2951	B
well that's what the you know that's what that's what it is geared for advertisement you know is uh to wet you appetite and give you that	2951	B
oh i've got to have that i can't live without that and that's the image	2951	B
that the younger generation has you know	2951	B
um-hum	2951	B
on that	2951	B
who was that that could	2951	B
is that a department store	2951	B
oh okay that's probably	2951	B
no it is not in uh in Dallas huh-uh no we we have Dillard's and uh Sanger Harris and Macy's and	2951	B
Neiman Marcus and things like that and i am sure that they probably would not have a problem either	2951	B
well	2951	B
self-control- yeah self-control though is the key	2951	B
um-hum um-hum	2951	B
um-hum	2951	B
um-hum	2951	B
um	2951	B
oh dear	2951	B
um-hum um-hum	2951	B
wow	2951	B
sure	2951	B
well experience is the best teacher and sometimes you know uh a lot of us have have to learn by experience and and uh if you can learn by someone's else's past mistakes then you are very wise	2951	B
if you can heed to advice given	2951	B
that's true yes i am yeah um-hum	2951	B
um-hum	2951	B
sure	2951	B
oh credit cards are you know really a blessing	2951	B
uh but you have to be wise when you use them_1	2951	B
and uh i have nothing against them other than you know people abusing it and then they get themselves in hot water and	2951	B
you know they're just hurting theirselves	2951	B
and when you uh have a bankruptcy uh it takes you i think about eight years to wipe that off your record	2951	B
and so you know that is the shame about that is uh and people won't touch you	2951	B
and you've got to live that down	2951	B
so you have to be very cautious about how you use your credit i mean it is a wonderful thing but don't abuse it	2951	B
oh absolutely sure	2951	B
um-hum	2951	B
sure	2951	B
that's right	2951	B
well there is a lot of people that uh know exactly what they are doing	2951	B
and they will run into thousands and thousands of dollars into debt	2951	B
and they will deliberately do this so that they can go into bankruptcy	2951	B
and they they have a way of uh diverting all of the things that they've bought and put it like in hiding	2951	B
no i've heard uh uh there was a radio program in Dallas that we listen to and i well it in fact it's nationwide	2951	B
and i was shocked at some of the stories that came out of that uh program about	2951	B
these people that really you know they bought all these wonderful things	2951	B
and then they went bankrupt	2951	B
and they knew that yes they knew that they were going to do that and they just um-hum	2951	B
and uh they said you know it was worth the uh jeopardizing their credit for that amount of time	2951	B
because they still had the stuff you know and they could write it off	2951	B
you know they can only um be responsible for a certain percent and not the full uh amount that they owed	2951	B
and i don't know who um	2951	B
determines uh the percentage rate that they have to repay but it is not surely	2951	B
what they are were indebted for	2951	B
um-hum	2951	B
so it it they use it as a scam	2951	B
instead of uh	2951	B
to me they were criminals and they used that- that	2951	B
in a in a really bad situation	2951	B
and that has kind of snowballed i guess around so i do not know maybe the courts and lawyers are	2951	B
working on that to cover- you know cover all the loopholes that might exist	2951	B
but i've never been in that situation and hope i never have to be	2951	B
okay	2951	B
no i can't think of anything i am sure that we haven't covered everything because_1 that is uh that is a great big uh a ball	2951	B
uh credit	2951	B
i can't think of anything right now	2951	B
well listen thank you for calling and you have a good day	2951	B
bye-bye	2951	B
okay i live in Plano in a uh four bedroom	2932	B
two bath house which is the area's dominantly three bedroom two bath	2932	B
so i'm just a little bit different than typical	2932	B
uh	2932	B
and of course	2932	B
the Plano area is basically with alleyways	2932	B
so everything around here is	2932	B
set up that way	2932	B
which i think is little- a little bit different than most areas in the houses the way they're constructed and it's a brick house with uh some wood	2932	B
it's real nice i like it how about you	2932	B
are most of the houses in your area three bedroom two bath	2932	B
yeah me too	2932	B
the only thing about mine um i think there's probably about	2932	B
oh when i go down the street i can just pick out houses that are that are identical to mine and usually they are the four bedroom	2932	B
um but they're spaced out	2932	B
oh i'd say maybe three or two block period	2932	B
because it's all different builders up here	2932	B
so it's kind of hard at that point to you know classify some of the builders	2932	B
but most of the builders all built three two	2932	B
but the one thing my house is a little bit different and i can pick it out again because it's not typical is i've got the	2932	B
oh what do you call it a uh	2932	B
double ceiling double high	2932	B
in one half of the house	2932	B
so like the den and the living room	2932	B
are all double cathedral ceilings	2932	B
and uh the kitchen is norm and the bedrooms are norm	2932	B
so it just goes down the dining room	2932	B
the family room and the living room that way	2932	B
and i love the space	2932	B
it just	2932	B
it's uh luckily	2932	B
i came from a house in Colorado which had the cathedral ceilings	2932	B
and i just lucked out and walked into this one and of course i felt the same airy feeling which i liked it real well	2932	B
so it's a nice thing to move into but	2932	B
again it's not typical in this area	2932	B
you can just spot them_1 because the ceiling- the roof is so high much higher	2932	B
but uh	2932	B
yeah	2932	B
well it's like when my son goes up into the	2932	B
so that means if i knock out the wall	2932	B
in my family room i could make another room overlooking my family room from upstairs	2932	B
with no problem	2932	B
but um i'm not that ambitious	2932	B
i told- maybe someday	2932	B
when i feel really ambitious and then get angry i'll start poking holes up there but until that time	2932	B
but uh i've noticed the houses around here are basically it's one story	2932	B
and they're all basically two	2932	B
uh bath two uh with three bedrooms	2932	B
and we're ninety i would say about	2932	B
oh about ninety five percent of them no i guess maybe- probably a hundred percent of them_1 all are mostly brick	2932	B
uh with some wood	2932	B
but	2932	B
it's basically all brick the next subdivision over from me is total brick	2932	B
and the one on the other side of me	2932	B
is about the same as mine	2932	B
but uh the one on opposite the street now they're total brick and they're basically almost all three two	2932	B
they're all three two	2932	B
no it's a creek they've put little fountains in and such	2932	B
oh	2932	B
do you have a lot of property i mean a lot of yard around your house now in Denton	2932	B
yeah when you get down closer in to the newer track homes you find almost like there's no lot line at all they're built practically on top of each other	2932	B
i know i was	2932	B
um-hum	2932	B
well this subdivision here has got	2932	B
oh there's enough to put	2932	B
oh i'd say uh	2932	B
what twelve feet between each house on each side well i've got more on one side than i've got on the other	2932	B
but i'm like you i came down from Colorado and there was more land up there around the yard	2932	B
with a big full back yard which here i look out my back yard and i can see the gate i mean the fence is right there i mean just don't run too fast or you'll hit it	2932	B
and i'm not used to that either	2932	B
i mean i could see people putting swimming pools in the back yard all around me but	2932	B
to me you put the swimming pool in your back yard and you've lost your back yard	2932	B
i mean uh sure i mean you've got a little place on one side or the other but	2932	B
but to me their not that big enough for a pool but you know they're going up so	2932	B
but it's uh	2932	B
it's great for mowing	2932	B
but yes i'm used to uh walking out the back yard and you can play catch across the back yard and you've got plenty of room to even play a small game of baseball but	2932	B
don't do it around here	2932	B
i hadn't thought about it that way	2932	B
it just- well see now with our jobs mainly hitting downtown Dallas we couldn't go too much further but we we went that way it was the schools and the	2932	B
cost of houses so we kept going out until we figured we hit a point where we need the traffic time to get into work and that's where we stopped it was the thing same problem	2932	B
but i think Plano is so very different	2932	B
i got laid off by TI	2932	B
oh i	2932	B
yeah-	2932	B
no i was working at the Dallas site	2932	B
my ex-husband was working downtown	2932	B
but i uh uh	2932	B
no TI as far as i'm concerned they've been great as far as layoffs is concerned so i have no problems- problems	2932	B
but as far as the housing i would like personally i would like to move out of a four bedroom house and go with something smaller but prices in Plano there isn't um	2932	B
there isn't a section in Plano you can really move to without getting caught	2932	B
and uh	2932	B
if	2932	B
my price right now for what i pay	2932	B
well Carol since today's subject is our homes why don't you tell me about yours	2932	A
well i- i certainly hope so we have a a classic ranch	2932	A
up in Denton Ranch style home i should- i would hate to think that anybody thought i	2932	A
the lot we live on is a ranch uh	2932	A
it's in a subdivision	2932	A
and one story	2932	A
it started out life as a three bedroom house and now has no two car garage and has uh	2932	A
the two extra rooms enclosed i suppose we still only have three effective bedrooms but we gained a playroom for the kids and an office	2932	A
out of enclosing the garage	2932	A
almost a hundred percent	2932	A
i- i can't think of any four bedroom houses in the subdivision	2932	A
ours is probably the closest to it	2932	A
you know how realtors are they'll say oh this could be five bedrooms	2932	A
yeah if you had two people that don't have any clothes it could be a five bedroom house don't need a closet	2932	A
uh cathedral ceilings	2932	A
well i hadn't thought about it in that sense of the high roofs	2932	A
we have cathedral ceilings in uh two rooms and the uh	2932	A
family room and in the master bedroom	2932	A
those are are pleasant	2932	A
yeah	2932	A
right	2932	A
if it's the kind of river i'm thinking of better them than than us you know	2932	A
are you talking about a real river creek	2932	A
well that's nice uh i came from Mississippi	2932	A
recently and the rivers that we had there were the ones that came with the rains and	2932	A
they didn't pay any any attention to banks and	2932	A
that kind of stuff so you're just as likely to	2932	A
wake up and discover you're in two inches of water	2932	A
uh it's a third of an acre i don't think that's a lot	2932	A
uh in fact i have been real disappointed in the six years that i've lived out here about lot sizes	2932	A
i'm more accustomed to a one acre lot being a standard and the two acre being	2932	A
what most people have	2932	A
that's true	2932	A
and while while there are some advantages to that there's less time spent outside making it look nice and taking care of things uh	2932	A
i just feel	2932	A
hemmed in	2932	A
by that	2932	A
it's not as comfortable a living	2932	A
for me	2932	A
entirely	2932	A
from- from that aspect you're right and and it doesn't take nearly as long to get out there and weed it by hand and that kind of stuff	2932	A
no the one that's	2932	A
sort of what drove me to Denton	2932	A
when i first came out here in	2932	A
eighty five i started looking and it seemed like the further i got away from Dallas center	2932	A
uh the more lot came with the house and and the lower the price at the same time	2932	A
and it just seemed like there was a ten thousand dollar drop for each city	2932	A
so	2932	A
so moving up thirty five	2932	A
i stopped when i got to Denton	2932	A
you all both you all both work downtown	2932	A
oh well	2932	A
this is a wonderful thing that you- that you're doing here still helping them out	2932	A
uh but you were working downtown	2932	A
oh	2932	A
oh okay	2944	B
uh-huh	2944	B
uh-huh	2944	B
yes	2944	B
um-hum	2944	B
um-hum	2944	B
uh-huh	2944	B
uh-huh	2944	B
well what's scary is uh about two three four months ago on a Sunday- in the Sunday edition of what is called the morning paper here The Dallas Morning News	2944	B
they showed a reporter and a um and a copy editor how they went out and they just took um a fellow in John Q Public in Dallas	2944	B
and all they had was let's see they had his birthday- they had something like his birth date the street address um they weren't even sure of the correct spelling of his last name	2944	B
excuse me and it was um very scary to see what they found out i mean they were able to find out what liens he still had against you know two or three houses through a two divorces children's names locations	2944	B
um it was really frightening	2944	B
uh-huh	2944	B
yeah	2944	B
uh-huh	2944	B
right uh-huh	2944	B
i do too yeah i don't the other thing i don't like is um in terms of uh like we just moved here from uh Minneapolis and uh	2944	B
to get the the very nice townhouse that we're in you were required by the property management firm that was representing a private landlord- you know husband and wife owners um who had never done this before	2944	B
they um asked us for again an astounding amount of information and	2944	B
what we really didn't have the same opportunity you know and i guess that's when i also get upset that if you're going to do it then i want to do it too	2944	B
um in terms of the credit yeah i know um we're also going through adoption now in for an adoption and i mean after we gave our fingerprints to the FBI you you look at each other yeah you look at each other and you say	2944	B
well too late now um so i mean it's it's a matter of anybody can get it any way and how if they really try um	2944	B
uh-huh go ahead	2944	B
uh-huh	2944	B
uh-hum	2944	B
uh-huh	2944	B
uh-huh	2944	B
uh-huh	2944	B
uh-huh	2944	B
no it isn't	2944	B
positive for anything see yeah	2944	B
see uh and i just started working well for an electronics firm down here i used to be a reporter and then now i'm in corporate communications and uh part of that excuse me was as a new hire that i had to take a drug test and i had never been asked that and i thought	2944	B
um i really didn't like it um i- i have very mixed feelings about i don't disagree or agree with you um i think i- i think that it's well and you're in that field so i don't know but it's	2944	B
you know we lived in uh Minneapolis when the Northwest Airlines pilot in the Dakotas yeah that hit the fan like uh you uh you're obviously aware of that um	2944	B
i don't know there should be some happy medium in terms of if they're going to do random um i i don't agree with random i guess i would look for a standard in consistency	2944	B
you know in terms of maybe at set intervals so that everybody knows what's going on um i don't see a problem with that i do think i see some level of necessity um	2944	B
in something where people are transporting other people uh only because of the things you've heard about	2944	B
The problem is the reason i feel that way even to a low degree is because it's the old story the minority make it bad for the you know majority um	2944	B
yeah i'm not alarmed	2944	B
yeah	2944	B
you can't yeah i know it's um	2944	B
right right it's a matter and that's um exactly what it is i mean that that kind of screening in general is a matter of exclusion um if we didn't give it we wouldn't go to Romania i mean if you hate to say that but that's the way it is	2944	B
uh-huh	2944	B
uh-huh	2944	B
uh-huh	2944	B
uh-huh	2944	B
in terms of the privacy yeah that in it and also i agree with that and in the in terms of the question um in terms uh i worked in medical public relations for almost a decade	2944	B
and that was pre AIDS and all the other um things that were probably there but just not excuse me labeled and i have a real problem with medical professionals um	2944	B
it goes back to the things like drug screening but if it's in any level even with the potential to endangerment um and i think this is much stronger than you know pilots or uh train engineers being screened um the transmission of the AIDS virus	2944	B
um it it that's a real ethical problem i mean i don't i don't have the answer i i you know i mean i think of the young girl in Florida who well yeah that's was she from your part of the country	2944	B
or was she from the young girl that uh contracted AIDS through her dentist allegedly and then they proved it yeah i don't i don't know um i don't know if it's the old story that we are killing ourselves in general or what um	2944	B
uh-huh	2944	B
oh yeah the i guess the question is uh the the thing for me is who sets the parameters or who has the control you know	2944	B
yeah	2944	B
yeah	2944	B
oh it's it's terrible-	2944	B
i'm uh very seriously not more than just seriously i'm more than likely going to be going to law school in the fall and yeah if i figure out that's still what i really want to do and	2944	B
the- the things i'm finding out are the in terms of things like privacy the way the law is interpreted presented	2944	B
um it's no better than journalism um except in journalism it's words um this is very frightening in that uh oh and in uh in Texas they they do- they do not require for instance for prospective adoptive parents	2944	B
whether it's domestic or international they're one of only five states that do not require a criminal investigation check	2944	B
yet if you're caught with let's just say um that somebody who's in need- not us but somebody who's need of carting um aluminum beer cans around they haven't touched them they haven't drank them they picked them up off the street and they want to take them to a recycling uh resource	2944	B
for money or whatever um they've they've been going through a lot of bad publicity here in the last three or four months again um because they've been arresting people like that	2944	B
you know	2944	B
because um in our case one is at the state and the other one is at the federal level because you have to deal- because you have to deal with the IN yeah because you have to deal with the uh immigration- immigration service	2944	B
yeah it is it's uh the whole thing is i mean there's again there's no consistency you know like in your in terms of you being a pilot and being tested randomly um	2944	B
i can't see why after a certain number of years or after a certain time frame they can't do it at an interval or you know i mean there just this	2944	B
they they do that in Texas	2944	B
they don't do it for drugs what they do is they check to see if you've got uh current insurance or they check to to see if you're permits are	2944	B
yeah	2944	B
i know and it's kind of um what's the word i want i don't it's just- to me it's just frightening you know i mean the old uh i'm old enough now where George Orwell uh way past the time	2944	B
yeah	2944	B
yeah it's exactly true i mean i	2944	B
well look at what we're talking now i mean it's look how we're talking now i mean you wonder ultimately what a network of stranger you know	2944	B
uh well i mean i've had time to think about it because uh we've had uh i- i- there's been a great deal of difficulty in finding someone to talk to so	2944	A
so um i i was thinking about a couple things uh and whether they are serious some things are serious and some aren't i guess the biggest thing that bothers me is	2944	A
is uh not the biggest thing but one of the things that bothers me is the credit information	2944	A
uh situation that you uh that you find yourself almost compromised into giving if you want any sort- sort of credit extensive- extensive checks and	2944	A
and things of that nature when um i i i mean i i don't know if that's an invasion of privacy simply i i do to i do feel it is but i don't know whether some of the questions they ask are legitimate	2944	A
uh because they are the ones who are making the profit out of your	2944	A
uh-huh	2944	A
well i guess i guess then it's just the big brother concept of the fact that once you give your social security number there are people i guess who are who are	2944	A
uh actually collecting all this all the time and and profiles are given i understand uh i read the other day that uh these telemarketeers when someone talks to you on the phone	2944	A
uh all all they need now is your telephone number which i guess is involved in this controversy of whether they can reveal your telephone number or not i i i feel that is an invasion of privacy but it	2944	A
yeah	2944	A
yeah exactly	2944	A
yeah	2944	A
my God	2944	A
yeah	2944	A
yeah i i have a particular subject that not everyone agrees with me uh	2944	A
uh well by by uh i make my living by uh flying airplanes for for a company and uh as a as a uh an airline pilot i have to take random drug testing	2944	A
i mean it seems to me the public outcry was for that at the time so i when i finish a a certain flight on a random basis i have to	2944	A
uh have a written- a drug test and and and that's without i uh probably cause	2944	A
and uh a and in the end now i mean they've tested they've spent forty million dollars and they've found uh i think uh in pilots anyway of something like uh	2944	A
uh eighty six thousand tests there's only been two guys have come up uh three guys have come up positive and one of them was a bad test so	2944	A
yeah	2944	A
yeah	2944	A
drug test right	2944	A
yeah	2944	A
yeah right	2944	A
yes i am	2944	A
yeah	2944	A
yeah i i can understand the public's alarm to it but i guess having done this all my life i knew that there wasn't a problem and and it indeed it has proved out that way but now try to get the damn thing repealed you know	2944	A
i guess i feel bad because uh not only that but in some of the instances like you just cited where you have to give your fingerprints i mean what what what happens if you say no If you say no then you're excluded and i doesn't seem the courts	2944	A
yeah	2944	A
that's right	2944	A
it's my feeling also that that that although i i don't know if it's that serious i- but that was part of the question	2944	A
i do feel the courts have have held up a great deal of of our privacy i mean particularly look in in some of the in some of the	2944	A
uh i notice in some of the sexual cases they've held up a great deal of privacy which i support of course but it i guess with our fear with crime and maybe airline crashes and things like that it does seem that we've	2944	A
we've slipped and that's eroded or at least those in the market place their everyday life seemed to take that as a signal that you know it's fair game to you you have to answer these questions of course	2944	A
uh i don't know i i feel there has been an erosion and i don't really know how serious it is except i don't like it	2944	A
um	2944	A
um	2944	A
uh-huh	2944	A
yeah	2944	A
What was that	2944	A
oh yeah yeah yeah	2944	A
right	2944	A
well i mean it it just take that that step now where where now we feel there's a need to do that and the next thing you know then	2944	A
uh there's always the need to to go and inspect lockers of high school students that	2944	A
yeah i guess so i mean well uh uh good luck to you you just moved to Texas from Minneapolis	2944	A
i i don't i don't hold out much hope for you i think they'll be a cultural shock i mean i was based there a lot uh several times in the service and i was absolutely flabbergasted at the in in at least in criminal law some of the some of the latitudes that the police had but	2944	A
oh yeah	2944	A
yeah	2944	A
um	2944	A
um	2944	A
yeah	2944	A
well i mean i don't understand if you if you don't if they don't make a criminal check why do you have to be fingerprinted	2944	A
oh i see oh the state doesn't require it	2944	A
well that's kind of that's rather that's rather unusual isn't it	2944	A
well i guess i guess the extension of that is why why not the next thing you know we'll just stop a random amount of motorists and then if we really think that drugs are a problem we can randomly stop anybody on the street	2944	A
oh they do	2944	A
yeah well there's there's all sorts of scare tactics i guess to to invade our privacy and	2944	A
yeah	2944	A
i just going to say nineteen eighty four is come and is come and gone but it's here	2944	A
and the computers of course helps that The computer abilities store that information	2944	A
there a lot of places to camp in Dallas	2930	B
uh-huh do you do a lot of camping	2930	B
uh-huh well that must have been fun though	2930	B
uh-huh	2930	B
well that sounds fun	2930	B
yeah we've done ours i've only been camping twice	2930	B
and one of them i don't really consider camping it was on the edge of the lake	2930	B
and it was at a camp i don't like those camping grounds where you know you got R V beside you and then another people in tents beside you	2930	B
i just don't care for that	2930	B
right well	2930	B
it doesn't uh we uh four years ago it was about four years ago my little boy was three months old and the first time i left him we went overnight camping and we went and we found this little peninsula out in the middle of nowhere by the lake	2930	B
and we had a ball just sat out there with our we didn't even use tents then we just had uh sleeping bags and fire going and we fried potatoes and bacon and everything for breakfast the next morning	2930	B
oh it did it did i didn't even think about frying potatoes but my sister-in-law she's always done a lot of camping	2930	B
and she's good she'd think about bringing a rake so you can rake your area out and you know	2930	B
uh-huh	2930	B
well she- yeah she was she is always prepared i mean she brought everything from like i said toilet paper to the rake the only thing we'd had to do	2930	B
we had to go out looking for some kind of a grill you know	2930	B
we and we and we seen this old refrigerator that somebody had dumped	2930	B
and we broke the i guess it's the freezing component and we broke that out of there and put it over our um hole	2930	B
yeah	2930	B
well it held our pan and you know the potatoes and stuff we had a good time	2930	B
yeah we're still waiting to go again	2930	B
uh-huh	2930	B
uh-huh	2930	B
uh-huh	2930	B
pretty	2930	B
well i love to swim so i like to get out by a lake or a uh you know somewhere close where we can swim	2930	B
uh-huh	2930	B
uh-huh	2930	B
yeah	2930	B
how old are your boys	2930	B
oh so they don't go camping with you	2930	B
oh	2930	B
yeah well i haven't taken my little boy yet i'm afraid to get him out he is	2930	B
so fearless he it terrifies me he	2930	B
think so well it's the water he's not scared of he'll go out into it until it's up to his nose	2930	B
and then try to tread back	2930	B
uh-huh	2930	B
uh-huh	2930	B
uh-huh	2930	B
yeah	2930	B
if you know what to look for	2930	B
well that sounds so neat	2930	B
yes	2930	B
well i'm impressed my	2930	B
my mother-in-law and my well they've always done a lot of camping i grew up in Louisville Kentucky and there wasn't	2930	B
i don't know but we just didn't get out my mother and my father split up when we were young so and my mother wasn't into that and that's who i stayed with	2930	B
so we didn't do much outdoors stuff except swimming and we went swimming a lot	2930	B
and uh	2930	B
oh excuse me my baby's getting sick	2930	B
i know	2930	B
yeah um i've got to clean her up i'm sorry	2930	B
appreciate it i enjoyed talking thank you bye-bye	2930	B
well not necessarily in Dallas but it's a very short drive to areas near here	2930	A
well i have done camping in the past uh	2930	A
i can't remember when the last time i actually went camping was it was uh several years ago and then i did most of my camping in the mountains	2930	A
well it is i enjoy hiking and camping we went to the Sangre de Cristos i have uh some land there and so it's it's handy to to station yourself there on the land and then	2930	A
make trips up into the mountains for backpacking and hiking and and overnight camping	2930	A
do you do most of yours in tents	2930	A
oh wow	2930	A
um	2930	A
uh	2930	A
uh-huh	2930	A
no i agree with you i think it's much nicer when you can really get out far enough away where that you can't see people right out the window but	2930	A
uh-huh	2930	A
uh-huh	2930	A
uh-huh	2930	A
doesn't that always taste so much better when you're out like that yeah	2930	A
uh-huh	2930	A
that's right if you don't you'll find every rock on it when you	2930	A
um-hum	2930	A
uh-huh	2930	A
uh-huh	2930	A
oh what a clever idea i wouldn't have thought about that	2930	A
oh that's a good idea	2930	A
um-hum well if you get a chance now there are some really nice camping areas uh up in the Wichitas which is in Oklahoma and uh Arkansas	2930	A
i can't remember the name it's it's on the Oklahoma Arkansas border	2930	A
and it won't take but just a you know just a quick look at a map to find	2930	A
where those mountains are but i took a drive up through there as a matter of fact last September just took the drive through to see what was there they have some wonderful camping areas there beautiful beautiful country	2930	A
uh-huh	2930	A
yeah	2930	A
right well Lake Lake Tawakoni is a pretty nice place	2930	A
and we had a two bedroom mobile home there but the boys still liked to throw their sleeping bags out by the lake and build a little fire and roast their marshmallows until the mosquitoes bit and then they came in	2930	A
oh oh they're grown now	2930	A
they go camping on their own once you start them they enjoy it all their lives	2930	A
uh-huh	2930	A
uh-huh	2930	A
oh don't be concerned there's much less for them to get hurt on camping than there is elsewhere	2930	A
uh-huh	2930	A
uh-huh	2930	A
uh-huh well it's easy to keep him occupied though on land i know that i took my kids we'd go out and i'd have them walk with me along the lakefront and we'd have a little contest finding the tiniest shell and finding the biggest shell and	2930	A
or we'd hunt pine cones or we climbed some uh pinon pines one year and gathered the cones so that we could eat the pine nuts	2930	A
and we did a lot of naturalist work when we were out we you know we we searched for dock and we ate the wild plants and we gathered wild berries and uh it's really	2930	A
you know the the mountains can accommodate you if you know what to find	2930	A
uh-huh i had my boys build their own little camp- you know three leg camp stools by cutting a branch off the tree and binding them together with bark	2930	A
and uh we cooked in a pot i baked them a cake right there on a camp fire they were so impressed i used a tire chain and the bottom of a Dutch oven	2930	A
uh-huh	2930	A
uh-huh	2930	A
uh-huh	2930	A
uh-oh	2930	A
well if our time is up we can quit	2930	A
uh-huh	2930	A
okay uh-huh	2930	A
you bet bye-bye	2930	A
uh well i work with computers just like your son	2982	B
and i actually do research in speech recognition	2982	B
and so as part of the reason i'm participating in the project is to to see how the stuff goes but um	2982	B
i was working well actually i haven't worked for any large companies per se	2982	B
uh recently but hopefully the job that i will have will have lots of benefits namely lots of vacations not real good salary but lots of vacations but	2982	B
um-hum	2982	B
yeah the uh	2982	B
well actually where	2982	B
i was working with the company	2982	B
one of the companies i was working for actually had very good health care benefits which these days i think are really important because_1 health care is so ridiculously expensive because_1 we're we're paying our own insurance right now	2982	B
for it um and i'm we actually had a little baby so i'm taking a little bit of time off from work ah congratulations	2982	B
and um so one thing that i'm very concerned with now is	2982	B
first of all health benefits because_1 it's more important with a family and you know our doctor's visits- routine doctor's visits covered my health insurance only covers um	2982	B
your emergency care and so	2982	B
right yeah but i don't	2982	B
right well my our deductible is five hundred but it's for each	2982	B
event yeah	2982	B
right but you know so it covers the emergency things but it doesn't cover if you get sick it doesn't cover	2982	B
doctor's visits things like that	2982	B
oh yeah it certainly is	2982	B
um	2982	B
um-hum	2982	B
wow	2982	B
um-hum	2982	B
and probably the medical- care -medical care is less expensive too	2982	B
um-hum	2982	B
so i think that in general the doctor's fees are probably lower there and so the insurance would cost lower	2982	B
well i know that friends of mine had a baby up in Boston and their costs were about fifty percent of what it cost to have it in Manhattan	2982	B
and they were at one of the better hospitals and you know good doctors in Boston	2982	B
and i was at one of the big hospitals in New York but that's a huge difference just between	2982	B
you know and it's two big cities that i think of as somewhat comparable	2982	B
so i was pretty shocked at that but the other thing that i'm really concerned about and most companies don't have some are starting to have is day care because it would be really nice to be able to have	2982	B
you know someone that could watch my daughter at work and i'd go to work and if she were sick i could go down and see her if she needs to be fed whatever it is	2982	B
and i	2982	B
it would be more convenient more productive	2982	B
i think	2982	B
uh-huh	2982	B
and your- and your and your hours are much more constrained and things like that	2982	B
and that to me well that you know the those three things the health care vacation and day care are probably the most important benefits i should suppose i should be concerned with	2982	B
life insurance and uh retirement plans but	2982	B
yeah	2982	B
right because_1 you're you know certainly something like day care at the work place would like make life so much simpler that it's worth paying you know having a lower salary i would certainly accept a lower salary for that	2982	B
you know everything else being equal because_1 your life would be so much easier and there's a question of quality of life also	2982	B
yep	2982	B
right and you you you don't feel like you're a half hour away if she something happened	2982	B
and you're less preoccupied with it i think	2982	B
so but unfortunately there aren't i think IBM has started having that in certain locations	2982	B
uh-huh is that locally	2982	B
uh-huh	2982	B
yeah because_1 Pittsburgh's a big enough city too but you know i wouldn't be surprised if thing's like that didn't happen more in smaller communities before they happen in bigger ones	2982	B
just because people might be more flexible in smaller locations and	2982	B
things like that because_1 many times small companies offer	2982	B
better benefits	2982	B
in terms of quality of life than larger companies	2982	B
like uh one company had proposed to me that i could come back to work after having the baby um any where between ten and forty hours a week	2982	B
and um you know call- call my own days call my own hours and	2982	B
yeah and- and	2982	B
you know which many times at a large company it's almost impossible	2982	B
to do things like that	2982	B
right and if you get two weeks off you get two weeks off and you're not allowed two weeks and one day	2982	B
and so it all depends on what your position is there too	2982	B
yeah	2982	B
um-hum	2982	B
uh-huh	2982	B
was that when you were um well you know those have its pluses and minuses too i've been a consultant recently and so i don't have any benefits at all and	2982	B
right and the same thing my husband is unfortunately being paid as a consultant and we tried to argue that he should get more salary for that than what he is and um they they they	2982	B
right and they they refuse to give him more salary	2982	B
because they say they can't pay more than this and that and they're not allowed to pay him more than what his previous salary was and things like that and you know times are rough now so it's new it's harder to get	2982	B
the uh	2982	B
your increases and things but um	2982	B
yeah well the	2982	B
right well he's been doing a long term he's being called a consultant and he's really sort of a temporary employee at a place	2982	B
and they they pay him as a consultant but he doesn't get any health benefits he doesn't get well we don't care about retirement benefits he doesn't get um vacation benefits and he does a lot of things that	2982	B
get factored into somebody else's salary so really his salary should be you know twenty percent or thirty percent higher just based on that not including the fact that you know it's a less long term commitment for the company and all that sort of stuff	2982	B
okay now you can tell me what you do	2982	A
uh-huh	2982	A
oh great	2982	A
uh-huh	2982	A
uh-huh	2982	A
uh-huh	2982	A
uh-huh	2982	A
yeah	2982	A
well the one John works for seems to have a lot- you know	2982	A
good benefits and the pay is decent	2982	A
uh-huh	2982	A
uh-huh	2982	A
uh	2982	A
um-hum um-hum um-hum	2982	A
oh	2982	A
great i had i had a granddaughter	2982	A
right	2982	A
um-hum do you have major medical benefits	2982	A
that that helps some if it depends on what your deductible is how high it is	2982	A
each person yeah that's pretty hard- that's pretty high	2982	A
right that's that's right that's	2982	A
and five hundred dollars is a lot to come up with for each person to be able to start using your major medical too	2982	A
yeah i know where my daughter works now she she course we live in a a rural sort of setting and where she works she has no benefits at all and her her wage is not	2982	A
not very good	2982	A
but it's a it's a type of area we live in of course living expenses aren't as bad either though which makes a difference	2982	A
well she has to pay for it herself you know they have to pay for their own insurance but uh	2982	A
uh	2982	A
uh well	2982	A
from what i've seen from my aunt and uncle uh really from Florida up to here they're not that much different	2982	A
uh-huh	2982	A
is that right	2982	A
uh-huh	2982	A
oh that's a big difference	2982	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2982	A
oh yeah should be	2982	A
yes uh-huh	2982	A
and it'd be much more convenient yeah it would be more convenient too um-hum oh yeah yeah my my other daughter works and has they have to take their two children to day care you know	2982	A
um-hum um-hum	2982	A
um-hum	2982	A
um-hum	2982	A
oh	2982	A
i don't know i think those benefits you mentioned- mentioned sometimes they're even more important than you the wage itself	2982	A
if you can get those benefits even uh they they come out to much a much better benefit than than an increase in your wage a lot of times	2982	A
uh-huh	2982	A
um-hum um-hum	2982	A
oh yeah oh yeah it make it a lot better	2982	A
uh-huh	2982	A
uh well and if it was there you would really have a little more uh knowledge on what's going on probably you know with your child	2982	A
right yeah	2982	A
right yeah	2982	A
i don't know my daughter one daughter works for MCI and they don't they where she works they don't have anything like that	2982	A
uh Pittsburgh	2982	A
Pittsburgh Pennsylvania	2982	A
um-hum um-hum	2982	A
um-hum	2982	A
yeah	2982	A
uh-huh	2982	A
um-hum	2982	A
oh so they were very flexible and that that would be great yeah	2982	A
um-hum um-hum	2982	A
they say you're going to do it this way and that's the way it's going to be yeah	2982	A
um-hum	2982	A
yeah yeah yeah	2982	A
true well that's true in any any company i think	2982	A
uh i've i've never well i can't say i've never i've maybe worked five years out of our married life out of the home- you know out of the home	2982	A
but uh the rest of the time i've been an Avon lady and a lady	2982	A
uh-huh	2982	A
um-hum and you have to take care of any benefits you want yourself yeah	2982	A
uh-huh	2982	A
uh-huh	2982	A
usually consultants make very good income	2982	A
is that right	2982	A
uh oh	2982	A
uh-huh	2982	A
uh-huh	2982	A
um-hum	2982	A
a consultant- consultant- consultant really is should be more knowledgeable than everybody else you know so it stands to reason they should really have- have more benefits	2982	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2982	A
um	2982	A
um-hum	2982	A
um-hum	2982	A
um-hum	2982	A
yeah	2982	A
um-hum	2982	A
yeah and they'll do it	2982	A
well Cathy i think that uh capital punishment certainly	2981	A
has- has a place in our society	2981	A
um	2981	A
maybe from the sense that	2981	A
there are some things that	2981	A
we just can't afford to have repeated uh even- even in the remote chance of repetition	2981	A
that might be true um	2981	A
um what i don't know is where do we draw the line	2981	A
uh do we say that	2981	A
everyone who commits murder in the first degree is liable for capital punishment if that's what the	2981	A
jury decides is an appropriate punishment for their crime	2981	A
uh or do we extend it	2981	A
uh beyond that	2981	A
well either you know	2981	A
uh i have a a nine year old daughter and there are some crimes that could be committed against her that are not even considered capital crimes that	2981	A
that i would consider basis for murder	2981	A
yes it does uh a lot of that has to do with	2981	A
the cultures that we grew up in and what's termed acceptable and and uh	2981	A
to what's allowable and and where are we	2981	A
uh	2981	A
you know if we were lived in a different country then murder is not so bad	2981	A
but over here where we're	2981	A
promised the	2981	A
civil liberties of pursuit- life liberty and pursuit of happiness then taking that away	2981	A
is a a heinous act	2981	A
i don't know i believe it's uh at the discretion of the	2981	A
judge or or jury	2981	A
i tend to agree with you there	2981	A
um	2981	A
my belief is that	2981	A
is that uh any crime that's	2981	A
freely committed you know freedom of choice these- these people had a choice of committing this crime	2981	A
that involves the taking of another's life or the altering of someone's life	2981	A
such as rape	2981	A
deserves punishment by death	2981	A
but then i'm also told that i'm a pretty harsh person	2981	A
oh i	2981	A
i can see a difference between	2981	A
a	2981	A
person who goes out to rob a store	2981	A
for food	2981	A
than a person who	2981	A
commits a crime to	2981	A
uh either for the thrill of committing the crime or the thrill the feeling of power that they get from it or to	2981	A
acquire drugs for some other i mean acquire funds for some other illegal activity	2981	A
you know that second group of people falls into the the group that i say give up their rights the the first guy	2981	A
i you know i just assumed that it was a guy the first person that that went out to rob a store for food	2981	A
that to me is is a different set of circumstances where he	2981	A
he deserves help instead of	2981	A
uh the loss of life	2981	A
that's right or with the	2981	A
i think i would probably lower the age to about fourteen	2981	A
there's some and and i	2981	A
certainly don't know myself but somebody needs to do a study	2981	A
that says at what age	2981	A
true and complete logical thought to include the the	2981	A
consideration of of long term consequences	2981	A
begins	2981	A
you know i i have an eighteen year old and uh it- well he's nineteen now	2981	A
and i don't think that i saw it in him until maybe last year uh	2981	A
and i have an eleven- and eleven year old and a nine year old and i don't don't see it in them yet but i'm i'm not sure where it begins	2981	A
okay well uh what's your opinion about capital punishment	2981	B
right i think i would agree with you on that too i i can't see any point in keeping someone who's obviously beyond any kind of rehabilitation uh keeping them_1 you know paying for them to live in prison for years and years and years	2981	B
when you could probably just eliminate the problem	2981	B
maybe spend the money on someone who could possibly be helped	2981	B
right	2981	B
uh-huh beyond murder or just beyond like first degree murder	2981	B
yeah	2981	B
yeah well that really gets into- into a sticky issue uh i could see that too i think there's probably things i could think of short of murder that someone i think someone would probably deserve to be killed for	2981	B
but gosh and- and who's going to decide which is how bad you know something that to you is really bad might not be quite so bad to me and	2981	B
yeah it's gets into a pretty sticky issues	2981	B
right	2981	B
yeah	2981	B
yeah in some eyes i think some people give up that i think some of what we consider rights are really more privileges than	2981	B
think what most people think of them_1 as	2981	B
i don't know what um Texas's criteria for capital murder is do capital punishment is do you know are there some set guidelines like only under these circumstances	2981	B
uh-huh i used to live in Virginia and i know when they first reinstated capital punishment it was only um	2981	B
if someone killed a police officer or someone committed rape and then murder those were the only two circumstances where you could	2981	B
give someone the death penalty which i think is a little too limited	2981	B
um-hum	2981	B
yeah	2981	B
yeah in general terms i'm not so harsh but then whenever i hear of a specific case you know where someone did something then it's- it's like yeah put it to them_1 so i i think i probably tend to be a little bit harsh too as far as that goes	2981	B
because yeah i think you're right that person voluntarily gives up when they decide to commit that crime they voluntarily give up their right	2981	B
to continue on with their happy life just because- you know they they ruin someone else's life	2981	B
right	2981	B
um-hum	2981	B
right	2981	B
yeah he didn't go out with the intent of hurting someone else	2981	B
or with no regard for someone else's	2981	B
well being	2981	B
what about uh like teenagers that get involved in a gang and do a drive by shooting or something like that say fifteen sixteen year old would you	2981	B
consider uh capital punishment for them	2981	B
uh-huh	2981	B
right yeah what age that they're accountable for their actions	2981	B
yeah i know that they are lowering the age of uh	2981	B
whatever is considered a minor i think the kids certain kids are have been tried as adults who were a lot younger than they used to be like	2981	B
i think i read about a boy that was nine or ten that got mad at some playmates and went in and got a gun and just opened fire on them_1 and they were trying to charge him as- as a	2981	B
oh	2900	B
yeah because when people can't pay they end up going to clinics or you know to public hospitals and that kind of thing and you know	2900	B
oh definitely	2900	B
right	2900	B
yeah yeah	2900	B
yeah	2900	B
um-hum	2900	B
oh	2900	B
yeah	2900	B
wow yeah well i think part of the the	2900	B
tremendous benefit of that is that there's so many people who wait now because they don't have the money until you know they have no preventative measures because_1	2900	B
people um you know just go on and on and on i mean so many people don't even get prenatal care or and it just extends with if if it what- what would be a minor problem to deal with if they had a help available early on becomes just this horrendous	2900	B
you know burden on the taxpayers they're saying now that one out of every ten child born in in public hospitals is addicted to crack well you know	2900	B
um-hum	2900	B
yeah	2900	B
yeah yeah	2900	B
oh well that should help	2900	B
yeah	2900	B
okay well okay thank you bye-bye	2900	B
um i guess my feelings are that uh we almost have a universal health care system uh to a great degree except that now i read where we've left out about thirty four million people	2900	A
and um i don't know exactly how we're gonna cover many of these people because i'm sure that some of them uh don't uh don't have the wherewithal to do it themselves so uh i- i have a feeling since i have	2900	A
just about as good a health care coverage that anybody can get that this uh then becomes an obligation of the government because it's gonna become an obligation of either state local or federal government anyway	2900	A
well it seems to me that that i'm paying anyway because when i go or my insurance carrier anyway when i pay something the bills seem inordinately high	2900	A
and the reason that they're inordinately high is because that has to cover the costs for the indigent people who apparently don't have the money or the wherewithal to do that	2900	A
would seem to spread it out a little better if the employers who	2900	A
well	2900	A
well who who else is gonna do this then	2900	A
i mean it's worked successfully in Europe i've heard all these stories about i travel extensively	2900	A
and spend uh maybe half a year in Europe every year and i find that the health care programs there	2900	A
uh are administered with uh at least people i talk to	2900	A
with uh a great deal of integrity and uh people don't seem to be reluctant to use them to any degree as a matter of fact if i'm injured or	2900	A
have an emergency when i'm say in Germany or France uh that i'm automatically taken care of i mean i don't even have to pay	2900	A
well i uh uh i- i- i know it i have a solution you see uh my- my solution even though i'm rapidly approaching the uh	2900	A
the age when i'll qualify for Medicare and Medicaid i- i my mother and father both uh uh well my father's not living but my mother is	2900	A
and they are um of- of an advanced years and when i see the money that's poured down the down the drain on Medicare and Medicaid i mean the absolute uncontrollable situation that we find ourselves in and the extraordinary amounts	2900	A
i know that because those people vote i mean they're the ones who get out and vote that's what's robbing a poor mother of the prenatal- prenatal care the young people aren't getting the proper care that they need and nutrition i think	2900	A
and we're spending on these useless many times useless and inordinately complex unnecessary tests in hospitals for older people	2900	A
that's right i mean it does seem like we're the- the- the- now i noticed just the other day in the paper that that Medicare will be based payments will be based not uh just on cost but on cost effectiveness so i guess-	2900	A
well i don't know uh we'll see how that goes i think that was just a regulation that was up for comment but we'll see what happens	2900	A
well listen uh i think i've i've exhausted my uh self on at least i've blown off steam of the way i feel about it	2900	A
okay see you next time bye	2900	A
well i- i been uh i've probably had more time than you have to think about this subject so i'll tell you is- is it a serious problem yes i do believe it's a serious problem however there are solutions to it	2956	A
and foremost uh where we compare we- that we are now doing fifty percent of our uh people are voting uh	2956	A
we're probably making a comparison against uh some European and uh and uh uh say newer republics that uh that have very high percentages	2956	A
uh so uh one of the reasons that that uh	2956	A
one- one of the reasons that we could get uh one of the reasons that it is lower in the United States is that mostly we hold it on Tuesdays God knows why we hold it on Tuesdays and then we further complicate it by saying you know we'll keep the polls open until eight o'clock	2956	A
most people uh a great number of people now work at various at different jobs that if a third of the people are shift workers they won't be able to get to the to the polls in any case if they uh have to work late into the evening and not get up	2956	A
my solution to that is that we hold it on Sundays as do probably sixty to seventy percent of the European countries now	2956	A
they hold it on the week no they hold it on a either a Saturday or a Sunday or at least a day when when uh a great number of people aren't working in in America that's not true because a a great number of people work on Sundays	2956	A
but but that's one of my solutions so	2956	A
have you absentee voted in in in Texas well i have absentee voted in uh New Hampshire and it's a fairly fairly complicated process where you have to go pick up the ballot	2956	A
i don't say it's that complicated but part of the process also is that you must register preregister at some particular point New Hampshire is fairly easy but other states you have to register every couple of years and uh	2956	A
uh that's almost a fourteen percent turnover every you know if you compound that that uh if it is difficult to register to vote that would remove your eligibility to vote	2956	A
well	2956	A
well maybe that's another factor the motivational factor the motivational factor is probably i	2956	A
well that's diminished by we- we've noticed this in particular i i'm just read two books one of them is Whose Stars and Stripes Now	2956	A
the uh trivial pursuit of the presidency in nineteen eighty eight it's a fairly decent book i mean it's uh	2956	A
uh the uh uh there was the Blue Smoke and Mirrors was the one in eighty two uh they these guys uh have taken the place of Theodore White on reporting elections	2956	A
in any case they say that uh there's a definite trend uh well you know toward candidates using negative voting it's the only way that you can use television effectively	2956	A
no the public would rather hear something negative about the other guy	2956	A
than- uh than than a positive factor and you- and you know to if you if you go on the attack and and put some sensational thing before the public as Mike Dukakis learned in the last campaign	2956	A
and it's not refuted people will you know uh believe it if you don't refute it as he didn't that that there must be some truth to the matter see	2956	A
well he didn't refute it until the last two weeks of the campaign he didn't believe anybody would believe that and indeed his trend started upward	2956	A
well they do	2956	A
well don't give too much credit to the American public for their motivational ability and and and it	2956	A
well it uh well i don't know is it working i mean that's that's the question i guess the question also is that we discovered is that they don't throw rascals out everybody seems disappointed but they don't throw the rascal out their own rascal	2956	A
uh my my solution to	2956	A
to part of this is is to	2956	A
to make it an economic- economic incentive for people to vote that sounds rather crass i think because then then you're saying well uh	2956	A
you know you- it could be convoluted- convoluted in many ways where people would actually uh by paying them i mean you know you take a certain amount off their income tax or property tax or whatever	2956	A
yeah but the idea is to get the individual to the polls and and and we have to make it as easy as possible for him to get to the polls	2956	A
oh you mean the special interest groups	2956	A
well read my lips and and and no new taxes and yet Bush did that but i mean but but he's excused from that generally people i've read polls now where they've excused him because there was a a definite necessity to balance the budget	2956	A
oh he he he gave it that he he did he did he promised the best he could and he's the president and he should	2956	A
he should address those problems and if there needs to be a change in a period of time why what was so funny about it is that i guess that it happened so rapidly you know he knew it he actually knew it and being associated with government he should be held up to the light for that and maybe he will	2956	A
but i think it's uh i mean i think you	2956	A
you still have a view that the American voter is different from other voters and he's motivated because we happen to be the cradle of liberty and all that i think voters are motivated uh	2956	A
well i don't know if they have higher turnouts overall i don't think England has i think England has about a seventy percent sixty five percent turn out	2956	A
i think that we just discovered in this in in the Indian elections is one of the greatest and massive things in the in the world	2956	A
uh just it was got violent- more violent every year they went down to almost fifty percent in this election before they blew up Gandhi but	2956	A
simply because people were so concerned about	2956	A
their inability that to that their vote doesn't count anyway	2956	A
and the corruption of politics in in in that situation	2956	A
but then but you know everything is relative to when uh you know we had higher turnouts because at that time we talk about the turnout relative to the eligible voter right	2956	A
i mean is but but before these enormous before this Voting Rights Act	2956	A
what we had was a a great deal of our population uh mainly the Blacks in the South and the Hispanics were precluded by	2956	A
by uh voting laws uh from registering- from their eligibility to register now everybody's available	2956	A
so if you really computed it they probably when we said we had a seventy percent turnout in nineteen fifty we really only had a fifty percent turnout because all the eligible voters	2956	A
you know the it was skewed by the eligible voters being less than the total population of	2956	A
no i think the high there's a higher percentage in in certain Black areas of voters i don't know about Hispanics you know	2956	A
i just	2956	A
i- i mean i haven't studied the statistics well enough to i mean i think in this sort of a	2956	A
conversation we can only do our own reactions	2956	A
um-hum	2956	A
what do you mean	2956	A
you know Karen i wonder if we are recording	2956	A
i did press one but usually by this time they tell me that the time is up-	2956	A
um-hum	2956	B
yeah	2956	B
um-hum	2956	B
um-hum	2956	B
um-hum	2956	B
um-hum	2956	B
what	2956	B
right	2956	B
right	2956	B
oh really they hold it on the weekends	2956	B
Sunday	2956	B
uh-huh	2956	B
huh	2956	B
well uh	2956	B
i- i know here in Dallas that they've just instituted in the last couple of years a um a real long period of time that you can absentee vote before the elections and	2956	B
they i don't think they've seen a really high improvement	2956	B
no no i always vote	2956	B
oh really	2956	B
hum	2956	B
to absentee vote specifically	2956	B
oh	2956	B
um-hum	2956	B
um-hum	2956	B
but i don't think it's difficult enough to prevent people who are motivated in the first place who or who are not just motivated who really believe that their they	2956	B
their voice is heard i mean and the people that i've talked to	2956	B
right i think that is the biggest one that's the biggest problem i	2956	B
um-hum	2956	B
oh really	2956	B
hum	2956	B
i don't understand that why do uh is that just because they have such a low opinion of the public and the public's um gullibility	2956	B
well he did refute it	2956	B
he he refuted it just wasn't effective enough to	2956	B
well that see i- i didn't believe anybody would believe that either i- i- i guess i have i have a hard time coming to terms with the the fact that the American public really	2956	B
was you know so	2956	B
well then how can a democracy work then how how can it work	2956	B
right	2956	B
right	2956	B
what	2956	B
huh	2956	B
well	2956	B
how about how about the reverse of that when i've heard about England's elections they are allowed to run for what a total of six or eight weeks	2956	B
even for the higher offices in the in the land what if we	2956	B
totally took money out of the campaign- made- just severely limited the campaigns so money wasn't so much of an issue i feel like if if we did that people would have a lot higher confidence	2956	B
that their vote was counting rather than their contributions would count	2956	B
i don't think- i don't care how easy it is for them_1 i don't think they're going to because_1 they don't think that their that anybody listens to their vote they think whoever has the bucks- they really think that the packs	2956	B
you know no matter what you're promised during a campaign and these days we're promised hardly anything of substance right	2956	B
and uh and uh yeah- no matter what a uh candidate promises during the campaign which isn't very much specific- any that they don't promise anything specific these days but whatever you're promised they just	2956	B
they just reverse themselves depending on who pays them what once they get into office i mean i think that's the	2956	B
yeah yeah	2956	B
well then why did he say that during his campaign then he should- it was totally	2956	B
yeah yeah yeah	2956	B
yeah yeah well	2956	B
what about what about voters in the other countries that you're talking about like in the European countries where they have higher turnouts	2956	B
and well the newer democracies because_1 it's going to be totally different but	2956	B
you don't think so	2956	B
uh-huh	2956	B
oh	2956	B
right	2956	B
oh really	2956	B
yeah	2956	B
hum	2956	B
yeah	2956	B
um-hum	2956	B
oh	2956	B
oh	2956	B
oh i see because_1 right	2956	B
weren't qualified- disqualified- were disqualified	2956	B
but isn't that isn't that kind of a blanket racist kind of thing to say the Blacks and Hispanics and other minorities just don't vote or is that just the the truth	2956	B
yeah	2956	B
well	2956	B
right right but you know that just made me think of something that happened down here in Dallas last year they have this huge fight going over redistricting here and at one point they did they took another vote on it	2956	B
and they uh the minorities could not get enough of a vote out to to pass their plan and this is something that had been going on for months it was on the news every night	2956	B
they and they have had lawsuits over it i mean it was it was a major issue and there still wasn't enough minority vote to get to pass the plan that they were backing	2956	B
so that's you- you know i think that you have really hit on something there	2956	B
to say that uh	2956	B
those	2956	B
well with the minorities	2956	B
and we're saying we have low voter turnout maybe it is is uh	2956	B
now that we have minorities included in the	2956	B
why did you not press one	2956	B
well i guess um i'll start out and that is um i don't know what section of the public school system they're talking about whether it's the first eight grades the high school or colleges i have mixed views on all three of them	2926	A
well i- i- i should imagine the lower grades what would what what's what's certainly drawn everyone's attention to that	2926	A
is the fact that uh many of the inner city and uh i guess what we'd call uh ghetto or poorer districts including rural districts	2926	A
don't seem to be able to produce the students that indeed- indeed many uh manufacturing and other enterprises want they can't seem to they can't seem to read properly do math properly and conform to what employers want	2926	A
so that's got everybody excited high schools i'm not too sure it seems that high schools at least produce candidates uh although- although i have great misgivings about the SATs	2926	A
that go on to a variety of colleges it seems a great deal of our public colleges	2926	A
have foreign students in them uh from um a myriad of nations and uh and also um uh i think that	2926	A
uh a certain percentage of uh the colleges produce a fairly decent- uh public colleges produce a fairly decent student or fairly decent graduate i should say	2926	A
oh i didn't realize it was that high	2926	A
wow	2926	A
yeah well that's what i was going to point out i think it mostly is that technical	2926	A
yeah	2926	A
wow	2926	A
yeah	2926	A
yeah that yeah that must be an inner school i just read a an amazing article i guess in this month's New this week's New Yorker about Baltimore	2926	A
uh which uh went on to talk about i don't know i thought it was rather slanted in favor of the mayor or or or the politicians in the in there i do- i do i do know a few people and have been have done some business up in Baltimore	2926	A
but it seemed to me that the inner school system there was the one thing that didn't system- the inner city school system was the one thing that didn't flower too well they talked about individual cases of people trying hard but it was very difficult	2926	A
i- i- i- i think if i was going to fault it now if i'm i'm looking to carry on a conversation	2926	A
that way i think- there's a couple of things that really bother me i think when i learned the other day uh uh that uh the average American the average American now watches seven point two hours of television a day	2926	A
and that school children uh are- are not far off that mark with six point eight now i don't know what school children what year that is i mean that's a hell of a lot time to be sitting in front of the tube	2926	A
well i	2926	A
yeah	2926	A
really oh so you're close to the subject	2926	A
and yet you know i have grandchildren i have ten uh nine grandchildren uh in various parts of the country and of course you know i can't speak to the	2926	A
rural or poorer inner city schools these kids go to a fairly- they live in a fairly nice upper scale neighborhood and they seem to be doing extraordinarily well i- i- i mean i quiz them and i talk to them and they	2926	A
they read well they do everything well but i- i- i mean i think that's a	2926	A
that's part of the environment	2926	A
yeah that that that that could be very well true	2926	A
yeah	2926	A
right	2926	A
yes	2926	A
really	2926	A
yeah	2926	A
no kidding oh i- i- i yeah i guess i could i can understand that oh i'm a product of the New York City public school system from fifty years ago uh maybe not that long ago but and um and so i- i	2926	A
always felt i didn't get a real good education in the public- in the grammar schools and part of high school	2926	A
so i lived in New England at the time i sent all my children to prep school i was i well- i didn't have that much money but we struggled and we did it and i thought it	2926	A
i thought a great deal of it was a great deal of the success that they had in their education was due to the low student teacher ratio	2926	A
and i- i- i think that could that's a formula that could be applied everywhere except it must cost a heck of a lot of money if you do it in public school	2926	A
yeah	2926	A
yeah	2926	A
yeah	2926	A
yeah	2926	A
well that that that's that that must be then then if that's uh i think we both agree on that then then then then a parent parental involvement has to be there and i guess you got to take them away from the tube also another thing that i have another	2926	A
problem i have is uh i don't really know how to resolve this but is the	2926	A
incredible at least in the high school and college level emphasis on sports where enormous amounts of money are spent and it seems to me that money- money could be more well well spent somewhere else	2926	A
yeah	2926	A
oh yeah	2926	A
yeah	2926	A
right	2926	A
right right right	2926	A
yeah	2926	A
yeah yeah	2926	A
right	2926	A
right but i mean it	2926	A
right	2926	A
to to what uh to sports- you say other things than sports though	2926	A
yeah i know but i mean they don't just send it to the new stadium or	2926	A
really i well i guess they're	2926	A
right right right	2926	A
yeah	2926	A
well i never thought of that benefit	2926	A
yeah	2926	A
well i- i never thought of that benefit but the consequence then i my i guess what i'd have to say about that is there can only be one champion	2926	A
isn't that something though i didn't realize that	2926	A
no	2926	A
yeah	2926	A
yeah yeah	2926	A
well Mark Spitz made a lot of money out of it and he didn't- and he came back this year didn't he but he didn't make it ah	2926	A
yeah	2926	A
yeah	2926	A
yeah	2926	A
well	2926	A
right right	2926	A
right well	2926	A
i read i- i also read i we're getting off the subject here a bit but i- i do want to add this to that because i- i was quite interested in that myself but i read where the reason that he had to do this in the sprint events is that national television wouldn't pay	2926	A
for the long- distance events and they didn't think they could capture the excitement to get sponsors if you brought just the finish- here he comes down the finish line right	2926	A
so it had to be it had to be where they could put it in one segment and get- and and i guess capture the whole thing for some sponsor	2926	A
let me ask you another question	2926	A
yeah well if- if you teach college- uh college and and i know when i went to college i- i went to summer school and i thought that uh in fact that uh my- my idea of it was uh rather than	2926	A
rather than finish early i just enjoyed some of the subjects that i was taking and i had the ability to to go in summer school and i	2926	A
i didn't didn't take those subjects so what that leads me my next thought is i understand there's a lot of talk now about extending the school year which seems inordinately short anyway compared to the Japanese or the Germans	2926	A
well how do you think that would work in grammar schools and	2926	A
yeah yeah that's right yeah	2926	A
um-hum what do you think about what do you think about the the lower grades you know K through seven	2926	B
um-hum	2926	B
right	2926	B
um-hum	2926	B
yep i uh	2926	B
um-hum	2926	B
yeah i- i- i just read some things recently where um	2926	B
uh	2926	B
colleges now uh graduate programs in general now train basically they're fifty percent foreign	2926	B
uh yeah all just about fifty- when you consider um when you consider uh	2926	B
especially in technical areas science engineering and computers yeah especially in those areas it's um i know- it's it's almost fifty per cent foreign like forty eight percent and that involves both Canadian	2926	B
and uh uh European Middle Eastern and and Far Eastern yeah i- i think um i think i have similar views that's you know where our elementary grades um	2926	B
it- it's amazing i have a friend who's an elementary- who's an elementary school teacher and she said that they recently	2926	B
you know they have to go through they have to they have to pat the kids down because they bring guns to school she teaches in the city of Baltimore and that	2926	B
um-hum	2926	B
yeah	2926	B
um-hum	2926	B
um-hum	2926	B
um-hum	2926	B
yeah	2926	B
um-hum	2926	B
right	2926	B
yeah and- and it's uh uh it's really you know kids can't read um	2926	B
it's really sad- they you know by the time they my wife teaches uh middle school yeah and- and they can't yeah by the time they get there they can't read they- they they can't read anything	2926	B
um-hum	2926	B
yeah	2926	B
yeah	2926	B
um-hum	2926	B
yeah i think it's it's probably the work that your your children your children are doing uh um	2926	B
she she's yeah she can tell	2926	B
she can tell you know when they have kids come in for they meet with all of the parents and she can tell before a parent comes in normally you know give or take eighty ninety percent	2926	B
you know what the parents are going to be like when they come in and the responses the parents will give back oh yeah	2926	B
um-hum	2926	B
yeah	2926	B
um-hum	2926	B
right	2926	B
i think i think it's probably very true	2926	B
um-hum	2926	B
um-hum	2926	B
but you know surprisingly i- i because you put such a commitment on education um your children probably could have gone to schools with uh uh a higher	2926	B
student teacher ratio and still done well because when they would come home you and your wife would say you know what did you do today if we let's sit down and read together yeah um-hum	2926	B
yeah oh it's parental	2926	B
yep um-hum yeah	2926	B
but you know- you know what's really funny is that they there's been some research because_1 i'm a i'm a college professor and um uh and and	2926	B
well- a lot of the research shows that like Georgetown while Ewing was playing at Georgetown basketball Georgetown	2926	B
and they were winning	2926	B
endowment to the university in other words money that could go to everything	2926	B
everything and normally gets directed away from sports realistically a lot of the was uh was probably two thirds i guess it's now two thirds of what it was	2926	B
when they were national champions in other words while they're national champions people donate more money	2926	B
average human beings like you and i average Joes that make a decent salary that are a graduate of the school send big bucks like couple hundreds of dollars but thousands of people	2926	B
because no because- normally it's because of the sports	2926	B
right right but see the sports brings in the money	2926	B
because when Georgetown was number one their their their money- money that was donated to them from companies from from local- from business people from graduates whatever was up into you know like twenty million dollars and now it's down to like fourteen million	2926	B
during that time period in other- other words	2926	B
their income has slowly- their their alumni- alumni giving and other funds have slowly dropped since then	2926	B
um-hum	2926	B
yeah	2926	B
yeah	2926	B
that's yeah it's it's amazing the way but now that's big time yeah but but uh smaller schools aren't like that uh only only the big time schools show that but you're right i- i think the emphasis on sports and as a see i'm a i'm a i'm a former athlete in a sense i swam	2926	B
um but swimming never gets much glory so it really doesn't matter but	2926	B
that's true that's true but you know they still	2926	B
he didn't make it no i- i would have liked it if he if he would have though but i think uh realistically you know you read the the research studies and uh i don't think he would have made it simply because	2926	B
the well- the event he was trying to swim they even the research shows that distance running	2926	B
so i would assume distance swimming might be similar that and he was good at distance splits as a swimmer you know at i can remember that but the distance um	2926	B
the the distance strength and endurance or whatever sort of starts to peak at about twenty eight twenty nine thirty that's why some of your long distance runners were in their late- early thirties	2926	B
and but he's was trying to make it in the sprinter's event and most of them are under twenty five	2926	B
um-hum yeah	2926	B
uh-huh	2926	B
oh you're kidding	2926	B
jeez	2926	B
and that's	2926	B
as as an athlete i just hate that go head yeah what were saying- what were you saying	2926	B
yeah	2926	B
um-hum	2926	B
um-hum	2926	B
um-hum	2926	B
right	2926	B
yeah i think i think	2926	B
i think uh in in some sense um what i would do before i would extend a school year is i would make it better before i would continue the agony	2926	B
and something you have to consider too um because i know as- as a as a as a former high school teacher i know that from right now	2926	B
uh-huh	2965	B
uh-huh	2965	B
oh no	2965	B
how much was the alternator	2965	B
did he did he hook up the wire wiring wrong	2965	B
uh-huh	2965	B
uh-huh they probably built that in so they could make money	2965	B
well i had a weird there's a little sensing device uh in front of my	2965	B
um	2965	B
um i'm not sure right in front of the fan- fan it's a it's an air conditioner sensing device i don't know why	2965	B
it actually there's a metal piece that fits through the belts uh	2965	B
and somehow that broke off	2965	B
and uh i i still can't figure out how it broke and uh	2965	B
anyway so a this piece obviously um i have a Subaru and uh	2965	B
i think you can only get it through Subaru dealer etcetera so	2965	B
uh this little sensing device costed like sixty bucks	2965	B
and and i haven't had too many problems with my car i got a eighty eight Subaru GL XT and it uh	2965	B
uh and then you know just basic maintenance and oil changes an i and i do not do my oil changes and i will not do my oil changes i've	2965	B
i think the first time i tried to do one	2965	B
ended up	2965	B
um trying to get- uh you borrowed somebody else's jack and i did this and i went and bought everything so after buying the filter and all the oil you're looking at ten bucks at least or somewhere in there an	2965	B
and uh and then to go to the trouble	2965	B
that i figured	2965	B
it's easier spending eighteen bucks at Jiffy Lube	2965	B
so that that's um	2965	B
you know as far as any maintenance on my car that i shy away from the oil changes that's for sure	2965	B
how did you put that many miles on it in	2965	B
four or five years	2965	B
oh a hundred and forty mile trip	2965	B
oh thirty five miles each way yeah	2965	B
yeah	2965	B
uh-huh do you work for TI	2965	B
okay	2965	B
i was going to ask you you know as far as how we're getting compensated for what we're doing right now	2965	B
um i don't work for TI and i'm just i get these green	2965	B
i don't know what you want to call them fake	2965	B
point things	2965	B
and uh i just wondering how i go about	2965	B
getting my cash	2965	B
oh okay	2965	B
okay	2965	B
okay	2965	B
all right well that's good to know i haven't been doing this- this is the first time i've been called in a long time and i haven't been doing it so	2965	B
and uh i've done it maybe twelve times	2965	B
uh-huh	2965	B
huh	2965	B
oh well	2965	B
i was driving a sixty six Plymouth Fury	2965	B
yeah	2965	B
yep and	2965	B
oh that- that's when they made cars though this things was the body was in good condition and you know it ran fine it was starting to burn some oil	2965	B
and um	2965	B
but i had to	2965	B
you know get- you know i	2965	B
after about three- couple of months after i was out of college i finally splurged and bought my car so	2965	B
yeah	2965	B
well you know these	2965	B
cars made in the sixties and stuff i mean the steel i mean the thickness i mean it those thing they're just	2965	B
the- you just don't see cars like that and they last a long time and they were simple too the engines were simple and durable and	2965	B
some people will still buy them you know they'll	2965	B
it always costs so much to fix anything or do anything with it you're just better off buying another car	2965	B
hi my last uh	2965	A
auto repair	2965	A
was my my uh alternator went out i have a nineteen eighty six Toyota	2965	A
uh it's a little Tercel	2965	A
and uh i have a friend- a friend whose real good with uh repairing cars	2965	A
so i got him to take the alternator off and take it and uh	2965	A
you know get a replacement part	2965	A
we went to a uh	2965	A
a a place called Quality Auto Parts an and their parts are	2965	A
supposed to be guaranteed and and everything and they're	2965	A
they're uh very reasonable so uh i bought the alternator we put- put it on the car	2965	A
and it it didn't work and it blew out all the fuses	2965	A
yeah	2965	A
uh	2965	A
i believe- something like sixty nine dollars something- something on that order	2965	A
no he hooked it up right	2965	A
it it was just that the the part	2965	A
just just didn't fit the car so	2965	A
i took it back and uh he he took the alternator- the guy in in the parts shop took the alternator and he put it on the little thing he has in there to test them	2965	A
and uh he said there was nothing wrong with the alternator so we we went back and tried it again	2965	A
put it on again and it still didn't work	2965	A
and we took the car up to um a little place called Pep Boys i don't know if you have them in your area	2965	A
but uh they're	2965	A
they're pretty reasonable uh car repair place also	2965	A
so uh took it up there	2965	A
towed it up there because it you know wouldn't start or anything and this thing just kept blowing out the fuses	2965	A
and uh took them about an an hour	2965	A
to um figure out what was what was blowing the fuse and it was it was the alternator that was blowing the fuse anyway	2965	A
ended up taking it to the Toyota dealer and the only problem was that uh it had to be a genuine Toyota uh alternator	2965	A
because most of the other ones that they say will fit it	2965	A
that that you know they sit in there and everything but there's just some little difference that	2965	A
um	2965	A
causes it not to work	2965	A
yeah- yeah i guess so and that was my that was my last experience	2965	A
uh-huh	2965	A
uh-huh goodness	2965	A
are you able	2965	A
uh-huh	2965	A
uh-huh	2965	A
uh-huh	2965	A
yeah	2965	A
uh-huh	2965	A
well my car is uh it's an eighty six and i really hadn't had any any trouble with it until- until that and the car now has a hundred and thirty something	2965	A
thousand miles on it and uh	2965	A
and this was just recent	2965	A
so i really can't complain about this one	2965	A
um well i used	2965	A
i used to work uh it was a seventy mile trip everyday	2965	A
you know two ways was seventy miles	2965	A
no it was it was just seventy miles yeah	2965	A
and uh i did that for about three years and it really it really added up	2965	A
i've only taken uh	2965	A
maybe two trips that were about four hours long down- uh	2965	A
down to Shreveport	2965	A
and uh the rest of it was you know it's just basically driving a long ways to work	2965	A
and now i drive like twenty twenty three miles each way	2965	A
so	2965	A
i'm getting a little a little uh little relief but still i drive a long ways	2965	A
but i guess because they're highway miles	2965	A
you know it's not so bad on your car as	2965	A
as if it you know were just	2965	A
regular street	2965	A
you know	2965	A
yes i do	2965	A
do you	2965	A
points	2965	A
uh there's a number that you call it's the same number that you that you call to make a call	2965	A
you you call that number and and uh	2965	A
somehow or another they'll give you an option to leave a message and you can leave a message	2965	A
i know someone that did that you leave a message and they'll they'll call you back	2965	A
oh really	2965	A
uh-huh	2965	A
well i don't know if i've done it quite that much but uh	2965	A
mine is mixed up too i have to call and get it fixed	2965	A
um	2965	A
uh let's see before i had this car i had a um	2965	A
um i bought an Audi five thousand	2965	A
but i bought it i bought it used	2965	A
i i just bought it from a friend who was going to who just charged me what the dealer was going to give give him for it for a trade-in	2965	A
and uh	2965	A
it had a whole lot of miles on it i i figured maybe i'd get one or two years out of it an i an i did get a couple of good years	2965	A
out of it and the uh	2965	A
the engine messed up on me	2965	A
and then i gave it to a guy to repair who works for the automotive- for the Audi dealer	2965	A
and uh he took the engine apart and	2965	A
you know he just said he couldn't fix it so the engine never got put back together again	2965	A
i	2965	A
wow	2965	A
i think those old cars	2965	A
might might be a pretty good bet because you	2965	A
i don't know i-	2965	A
uh-huh	2965	A
um	2965	A
uh-huh	2965	A
i read a book one time that said that the best cars were made before seventy four	2965	A
uh-huh	2965	A
yeah	2965	A
yeah it's easy to	2965	A
it's easy i guess it's still easy to find engines for those cars engines and transmissions	2965	A
and if you i guess if you keep trading- changing them out you can keep a car for a long time	2965	A
course i guess i could do the same thing with the the Toyota that i have	2965	A
i just don't know how much they'll charge me to	2965	A
yeah	2965	A
i guess so but i just think they cost too much in the in the first place	2965	A
now a days	2965	A
okay Catharine can you uh give me your views on uh what you think about the uh care of elderly	2958	A
um yeah	2958	A
uh we uh just went through an experience um	2958	A
both my parents passed away fairly young and uh	2958	A
my wife's mother died when she was only nine years old so the only one that we really had was her father and uh	2958	A
uh he's no longer with us he passed away when he was uh he was going on eighty nine years old so he had a good long life	2958	A
but he always maintained his own apartment he lived in the city he lived in uh Rhode Island- in fact we live in Rhode Island i work in in the Massachusetts plant but i live in Rhode Island	2958	A
he's always lived in the in the city and he's always been kind of independent he's uh	2958	A
he's never had a a never owned an automobile never had a driver's license you know he's always you know yeah	2958	A
he got around yeah yeah because he lived right down down city in the in the	2958	A
port authorities right there so he used to take the steamer down to New York and you know i mean he went	2958	A
yeah he went everywhere he wanted to go	2958	A
no and then uh about a year and a half ago he uh he started having mini strokes	2958	A
and we got kind of concerned about him and then uh he had fallen in the street a couple of times but	2958	A
he uh	2958	A
he still didn't want to give up his apartment	2958	A
and uh	2958	A
finally a year ago last Thanksgiving um my wife tried to call him and he wouldn't answer the phone so we kind of expected the worse so i went down	2958	A
and he had had another stroke and uh i found him he was just he was just standing in the middle of the room all covered with shaving cream he always trying to shave and uh he didn't know who i was uh so we brought him up to to uh stay with us	2958	A
and uh he snapped- he snapped out of it	2958	A
he uh	2958	A
he was probably uh	2958	A
say ninety five percent himself	2958	A
and in in the course of the next during the next year towards again it was getting on towards Thanksgiving time he started having you know more strokes and then uh	2958	A
uh one morning he felt real dizzy so we took him to the hospital	2958	A
and while he was in the hospital he had a a massive stroke	2958	A
and it crippled him	2958	A
on one side his right side	2958	A
so he didn't have the use of of his arm or his leg or and then uh he lost the ability to speak	2958	A
and we're not sure but we think that he was	2958	A
very hard of hearing to begin with his almost his whole entire life	2958	A
so we figured that uh his hearing deteriorated even further and his eyesight	2958	A
um we did as as much as we could for him and then it got to the point where we couldn't handle him anymore	2958	A
um i was working during the day and and uh	2958	A
uh my wife couldn't she she couldn't get him up	2958	A
so um	2958	A
the alternative was to put him back in the hospital which we did and they took care of him you know and he slowly deteriorated and uh	2958	A
to the point where he uh became fairly stable i mean he he knew who we were when we went in to visit him even though he couldn't communicate with us	2958	A
and then they said that um there was nothing more that they could do for him and he had to go into a nursing home the doctor said that he couldn't come back with us	2958	A
because we couldn't take care of him	2958	A
and we started looking around and they said no the first nursing home that's closest to you that has an available bed is where he's going to go	2958	A
so we didn't have much of a choice	2958	A
well at least up here um so he went in there anyhow and my wife went in there every day to see him and you know she	2958	A
uh at first well- at first no	2958	A
it's uh it's very cold uh or at least we thought it was they're very clinical they're it's like a well it's a business	2958	A
you get them_1 in uh you do what you have to do for them_1 and that's it	2958	A
um so I would go on weekends and she would go during the day to to visit him and they had a laundry you know they had the whole facility was there but	2958	A
closed up most of the time so she'd go in and she'd do his laundry for him and she'd go in and feed him and	2958	A
and it got to the point where um they we knew them just as much as they knew us and and they really cared for him at you know he was in there for almost six months	2958	A
with the nursing home right um and it was run the nursing home was run by uh	2958	A
regular staff but it was owned by Seventh Day Adventists	2958	A
which was a surprise to us you know we didn't realize that they had i guess	2958	A
uh but most of the people were	2958	A
well they didn't have anything to do with it they owned it	2958	A
but they	2958	A
i suppose they cared how it was run but they had an administrator that ran it and and most of the people were um	2958	A
uh aliens you know uh Jamaicans or Africans or	2958	A
and they uh they took real good care of him they uh he had lost a pair of slippers uh one day and one of them out of her own money bought a pair of slippers for him and you know that type of thing	2958	A
but i think only because my wife spent so much time there she was there i mean every single day during the week and then on weekends we would go in the both of us	2958	A
and she would do things and she would donate little things and she'd help clean up the tables and you know that type of thing so um	2958	A
but you're right when most when most people end up in there and i hear it from a lot of elderly people their greatest fear is that they're going to end up there and nobody's going to see them	2958	A
they'll be abused but you hear horror stories all the time	2958	A
but if you care	2958	A
then it makes a difference those people	2958	A
that have uh a a lot of visitors	2958	A
and we had a gentleman that uh that uh	2958	A
let's see maybe about a week after my father-in-law was in there he shared his room he came in he could get around fairly well uh he he again had a had a stroke and he was partially paralyzed	2958	A
yeah yeah in fact uh	2958	A
we go down to see him she goes down occasionally maybe maybe uh once or twice a week just- just to see him	2958	A
and uh i'll stop in maybe once or once or twice a month on the weekend i'll go down to see him	2958	A
uh yes but he gets out he can get out you know he can uh he's got a lot of friends and they take him here and they take him there so he's not as as bad off as some of the people because some of them_1 are in there and in the six months that my father-in-law was in there	2958	A
um i've i've seen a lot of them_1 that didn't have any visitors whatsoever at least while i was there	2958	A
yeah they just uh	2958	A
yeah and uh we had an old dog an old shepherd uh they were inseparable my father-in-law and the dog we brought the dog down there and it was nice and all the old people oh look at the dog and	2958	A
well most people don't do that you know they don't uh they don't they figure- figure once you're in there you forget everything and that's that's really not the case and it's it's sad um	2958	A
i hope that i never get into that situation where you know the kids will say well okay dad you know here you go	2958	A
i think i'll walk off into the mountains somewhere or out into the	2958	A
but yeah yeah and you know and there's something to say for that i think	2958	A
right they do and and the people that	2958	A
that have families that don't	2958	A
well	2958	B
i would i hate to see them being put into a a hair care- or a health facility care environment because they then feel like you know the family has abandoned them	2958	B
is uh what i get the comments from elderly people that i know that it's happened to	2958	B
and the elderly people that i that are still hanging onto their homes that is their greatest fear is to be put into a a a care facility rather than their families taking them in	2958	B
because the families then seem to neglect visiting them	2958	B
but if that is the case that they have to go to a care facility like that i think that care facility has to be thoroughly investigated as far as the uh medical um	2958	B
evaluation what kind of credentials do the medical people hold uh if they're qualified uh what type of recreation do they have for them uh their food uh situation	2958	B
um	2958	B
the environment that they are exposed to the majority of the time that they're there is it bright and cheery um	2958	B
and to put them in with people that	2958	B
have the same type of uh lifestyle uh that they would feel more- more welcome in uh	2958	B
in making new friends because they can relate to certain individuals because of their personalities	2958	B
um	2958	B
so i guess i would like to hear how you feel about it now Ray	2958	B
oh my	2958	B
i- i see	2958	B
yes he did uh-huh	2958	B
um-hum	2958	B
that's wonderful that's good	2958	B
so he was very independent wasn't he	2958	B
yes	2958	B
wow that's wonderful	2958	B
sure he it didn't have any hindrances for him	2958	B
um-hum	2958	B
oh bless his heart	2958	B
um-hum um-hum	2958	B
um-hum	2958	B
um-hum	2958	B
um-hum um-hum	2958	B
that's wonderful	2958	B
um-hum	2958	B
um-hum	2958	B
um-hum um-hum	2958	B
i see	2958	B
sure i understand that	2958	B
um-hum sure	2958	B
um-hum	2958	B
um-hum	2958	B
um-hum	2958	B
right	2958	B
wow i didn't know that they were that uh	2958	B
were you satisfied with uh the facility	2958	B
um-hum	2958	B
um-hum	2958	B
right	2958	B
oh	2958	B
um um-hum	2958	B
so you established a relationship with the uh the personnel there um-hum um-hum	2958	B
okay	2958	B
well then you did see some compassion from the people there	2958	B
or were they just very businesslike and perhaps not of that faith	2958	B
okay	2958	B
okay um-hum um	2958	B
okay yes	2958	B
i see uh-huh	2958	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2958	B
um-hum	2958	B
um-hum	2958	B
right	2958	B
sure	2958	B
that's right	2958	B
oh yes sure	2958	B
oh absolutely absolutely	2958	B
um-hum	2958	B
um-hum	2958	B
um-hum	2958	B
um-hum so he kind-	2958	B
yeah yeah- so he kind of adopted you and your wife	2958	B
uh-huh um-hum	2958	B
um-hum	2958	B
well i'm sure he looks forward to that	2958	B
um-hum	2958	B
um-hum	2958	B
right yeah	2958	B
they're abandoned by their families yeah or if they or they might not have any at all	2958	B
um-hum	2958	B
um-hum	2958	B
um-hum	2958	B
oh yes	2958	B
um-hum um-hum	2958	B
um	2958	B
of course yes	2958	B
um-hum um-hum um-hum	2958	B
like the old Indian people used to do	2958	B
yes they died with dignity didn't they	2958	B
um-hum	2958	B
so PC's personal computers-	2991	A
do you have a personal computer	2991	A
um-hum	2991	A
hm i i work with them at Kelly Services	2991	A
doing uh data entry	2991	A
um-hum	2991	A
what do you- what do you think about them_1	2991	A
you mean instead of people or	2991	A
um-hum	2991	A
right	2991	A
um-hum	2991	A
and you really have to be able to type pretty fast before you know before it it really saves time	2991	A
um-hum	2991	A
um-hum	2991	A
um-hum	2991	A
to set up the boundaries correctly and	2991	A
how many lines you're going to use in it and-	2991	A
um-hum	2991	A
can't can't you put	2991	A
can't you put it on a disk and then just edit it	2991	A
if- if you need to when you go back	2991	A
right	2991	A
um-hum	2991	A
and and- and um	2991	A
rewrite the whole thing	2991	A
how does the word wrap work on that do you end up with very different length lines	2991	A
hm	2991	A
and it divides the words by itself	2991	A
oh okay	2991	A
um-hum	2991	A
right	2991	A
right	2991	A
um-hum	2991	A
they space it out in in the line itself oh	2991	A
they	2991	A
um um-hum	2991	A
um-hum	2991	A
um-hum do you think it's a lack of training um or it's- just that they don't use the materials that are available to them	2991	A
um-hum	2991	A
right um-hum it's better to learn it directly from the manual	2991	A
especially when you have to trouble shoot some things	2991	A
-because a lot of the times the computer the program still has uh bugs in it and you have to work around it	2991	A
hm have you worked mostly on IBM um	2991	A
um-hum	2991	A
yeah that's uh	2991	A
that's all i've seen in offices is IBM um-hum	2991	A
right	2991	A
well do you think it's been five minutes yet or	2991	A
oh okay well- well it was nice talking to you thank you bye-bye	2991	A
no i don't not at home i work with them quite a bit though	2991	B
oh okay	2991	B
the well i think they're useful i think they're	2991	B
in some in some instances they're they're over used	2991	B
well that's not the right way to say it um	2991	B
well i think that uh some some work places where i've been they they set up like everybody has their own PC	2991	B
which a lot of times everybody doesn't need a PC and it really without them knowing how to use it properly it slows them down more than it helps them accomplish something	2991	B
they spend more time messing with the PC than they would actually accomplishing the task that they're trying to do if they didn't have a PC at all	2991	B
uh-huh that's true	2991	B
and you have to you know be familiar with the like there're so many different software packages	2991	B
it- you have to be familiar with the one that you're going to be using most	2991	B
a lot of times uh	2991	B
people	2991	B
know about half of the capabilities of a package that they should know to actually be able to use it properly and so they waste more time with their trying to uh	2991	B
to figure out how to do you know other things	2991	B
than they would	2991	B
if they if they actually understood what they were trying to do you know like uh they want to to format a report a certain way	2991	B
and if they really understood the capabilities of the package they could they could do that in uh about you know half the time that they spend	2991	B
trying to figure out how to do it without spending the time to learn the package properly	2991	B
right exactly	2991	B
uh-huh	2991	B
a lot of times they they they do it manually on the computer which just really is a waste of time and then if they ever have to change anything in that in that in the document	2991	B
they have to go back and redo it all manually whereas if they had learned the package properly to start with and had set it up correctly the package would do that for them	2991	B
whenever they wanted to make a change so i i've seen that as a problem	2991	B
right but in some in some cases the with the formatting what i'm talking about is that they would set up they set up a certain um	2991	B
document and it may be eight pages long	2991	B
and they set it up manually so that they have all their spacings and formattings and tabs set manually	2991	B
and um then when they have to make a change say they want to insert a paragraph they've got to go through the document and reset all the page breaks manually	2991	B
and rewrite the whole thing instead of having the if if they had set up the formatting on the system itself it would do that for them	2991	B
and save them a lot of time but a lot of people don't spend the time to learn the package	2991	B
oh no no you can left and right justify the whole thing it comes out just perfectly spaced like a block	2991	B
it'll it'll automatically it's like typesetting it'll automatically do that for you	2991	B
usually it doesn't divide words they usually have it it- have it space the words in a line rather than divide a word	2991	B
that you see like in a newspaper	2991	B
they typeset they don't usually break words in a newspaper if the if one line is going to be a lot shorter than another line they just they just add spaces to that line to make it look long as the rest of the lines	2991	B
right and most computers do that most packages- most software packages will do that for you	2991	B
and i've known people that have used a package for for five years you know and i would say well have you- you know you know more about this package than i do how do you left justify and they would say i don't know	2991	B
and it would take me maybe two or three minutes looking in the manual to figure out what command it was to caused this to happen	2991	B
and they would say how did you do that and i'm like well it's really easy and they were like well i never knew that and that obviously they'd never considered looking it up you know	2991	B
sometimes it's sometimes well it's it's a number of different things sometimes they don't uh	2991	B
they don't think that they can get any information out of the manual some manuals aren't really designed very well	2991	B
but some of them are and more and more of them are coming out written in a way that it that just a a basic general user can understand them so i think um	2991	B
people think it's going to take them a lot longer to learn it properly than it really would and so they're really wasting time rather than saving themselves time because they think well it's quicker just to do it myself when it's really not	2991	B
well i think so	2991	B
um-hum exactly	2991	B
uh-huh	2991	B
uh the the with PC's they're either IBM or IBM compatible mostly	2991	B
that is you know the industry standard	2991	B
uh-huh	2991	B
there's a lot of of really good IBM compatibles	2991	B
too they don't have to necessarily be the IBM brand but they have to adhere to that industry standard	2991	B
oh probably	2991	B
okay bye-bye	2991	B
do you y'all do you get together with family reunions or	2963	B
oh that will be fun if you haven't done it in a while	2963	B
oh where is your family from	2963	B
oh	2963	B
so you are going to have to go there	2963	B
yeah	2963	B
oh	2963	B
yeah	2963	B
my family is from Kentucky most of them is down there	2963	B
i have got an uncle in Louisiana and another sister here in Texas	2963	B
we did when i was growing up it was every summer we got together now my grandmother just passed away this last year so	2963	B
you know she was the-	2963	B
uh-huh	2963	B
yeah	2963	B
well it	2963	B
it sure does	2963	B
well we in Kentucky it wasn't hard because everybody lives so close together we just did it word by mouth- you know by word of mouth	2963	B
you know	2963	B
my uncle in Louisiana he is the only one that	2963	B
you know had to travel	2963	B
and now i have got a sister in Germany and	2963	B
we are just scattered all over the place so it is going to be hard this time but we have got a huge family	2963	B
yeah because_1 it is so fun i mean	2963	B
we my mother has got like thirteen brothers and sisters	2963	B
yeah she has got a huge family and every one of them have five or six kids and most of them you know have got kids	2963	B
yeah it we just we had two baseball bleachers full of people and there are still about eight or six eight or ten people taking pictures	2963	B
yes and it was just the last time we had one it was so fun	2963	B
yeah	2963	B
yeah well i	2963	B
we have always had ours in a park or something but it's always been the same park and there is nothing really special there only thing is it is big and it is open	2963	B
um-hum	2963	B
uh-huh in Missouri	2963	B
well that was part of the problem with	2963	B
the ones we have now the kids would sneak off and we were just being kids and we found what we thought was just an old water hole so we was going swimming	2963	B
and like i said we was just stupid kids we was like eight and ten years old	2963	B
and our parents came and caught us we had been playing in the sump it was	2963	B
part of the sewage cleaning system	2963	B
<b_aside> Kyle don't <e_aside> i have got a four year old	2963	B
yeah but if we could have gotten it by a lake or something i thought that would have been much better	2963	B
yeah well they there was uh i am sorry there was uh i remember now there was like uh a baby pool just about a foot deep	2963	B
yes i remember my little brother riding a bicycle through it we were all kids anyway	2963	B
oh but i love it all the different foods because_1 that yeah	2963	B
that's the yeah	2963	B
so how long did you say it has been since you all had one	2963	B
yeah	2963	B
well i have been married almost five	2963	B
so i guess it has been seven years since we have had one and since then we've lost	2963	B
oh well just our grandmother that is surprising	2963	B
um-hum	2963	B
oh if i can ever get down to Kentucky it has been like four years since i have been home	2963	B
yeah that is the reason that is the reason i don't i would get on a bus any day by myself but i won't do it with the babies	2963	B
because_1 uh i have got uh a four month old and a four year old	2963	B
so i am just starting	2963	B
and i just quit too	2963	B
uh i won't be adding any more to the family reunion	2963	B
yeah they are good kids though	2963	B
so uh i am not too upset	2963	B
anyways i've enjoyed talking to you	2963	B
all right all right you too bye-bye	2963	B
yes we try to uh we have not in some years now and i think we are going to try to have one this summer	2963	A
my aunt is planning it	2963	A
uh Missouri	2963	A
southwest part of Missouri	2963	A
that will will be where it is uh if if she gets it planned i have been out of town so i do not know what she has been doing but uh	2963	A
they are all getting very very old all my aunts and uncles so we need to see them soon	2963	A
uh-huh	2963	A
right do you all get together often or	2963	A
uh-huh	2963	A
right	2963	A
i think as we get older it is difficult- more difficult to uh	2963	A
when all my aunts and uncles are in their eighties now so it is uh	2963	A
i have to uh i will probably have to take charge and do it one of these uh one of these	2963	A
days	2963	A
but uh	2963	A
i still have elderly parents alive so uh it takes a lot of effort to either get everybody called or written and settle on a date you know that	2963	A
and if they are	2963	A
right	2963	A
uh-huh	2963	A
oh my gosh	2963	A
yeah	2963	A
so the	2963	A
yeah and we need to have more and more of them i hope- i think i hope that is not a lost art that people getting together as they do spread out all over the world	2963	A
yeah it is	2963	A
oh i see	2963	A
uh-huh	2963	A
sure that makes a big crowd	2963	A
yeah	2963	A
is that	2963	A
is that right	2963	A
that is wonderful i hope	2963	A
well we need to have another one i hope my aunt is successful as uh later well it is probably not going to be done because i have not heard from them i it was supposed to be this June so i don't imagine there is anything coming this is hardly almost June	2963	A
so	2963	A
uh-huh	2963	A
yeah that's	2963	A
we have it usually at this uh at this one park because_1 there is a pavilion there in case it rains and	2963	A
and uh you have to have it uh fairly early in the summer or it is too hot up there	2963	A
in Missouri yeah it is too muggy- it is not just uh very humid and the old people cannot take it anymore	2963	A
uh-huh	2963	A
um-hum	2963	A
isn't that great	2963	A
yeah	2963	A
yeah	2963	A
yeah well that keeps you busy yeah	2963	A
yeah it would have been something for the young people to to do but	2963	A
um-hum	2963	A
yeah	2963	A
every family has all that going on i am sure	2963	A
so	2963	A
oh i do too that is the best part of it	2963	A
everybody bringing something for a potluck picnic and	2963	A
oh grand yeah	2963	A
i do not know i think it has been uh four three or four years or five even uh since they have had it tried to get everybody together they are just spread out so much and	2963	A
and we really need to uh no matter how- what kind of crowd they get	2963	A
i hope	2963	A
um-hum	2963	A
yeah well time flies so fast it may have been that that long since we have one it is hard to remember but i think it has been about four or five years	2963	A
so uh	2963	A
anyway i- i hope both our families get to have one soon	2963	A
yeah it is difficult with little ones i know when we had had our	2963	A
um-hum	2963	A
sure	2963	A
oh Lord	2963	A
oh i am telling you	2963	A
that's uh	2963	A
no i hope	2963	A
it i know it takes a lot of effort right with with that with two little ones like that	2963	A
yeah	2963	A
enjoyed talking to you good luck in everything	2963	A
bye-bye	2963	A
well uh i'm uh a bit of a seafood lover i suppose uh i have a a health problem in that i my cholesterol is high	2918	B
so i'm in the in the process of bringing that down so i don't eat a lot of beef or pork or almost none	2918	B
so i would say most likely a dinner party would be you know would include some kind of fish seafood or you know or poultry type dish as the main course	2918	B
but uh	2918	B
right	2918	B
well uh that sounds good	2918	B
yeah	2918	B
um-hum	2918	B
uh-huh	2918	B
yeah	2918	B
yeah	2918	B
yes that sounds- sounds really good uh	2918	B
um-hum	2918	B
right yeah	2918	B
right and that's	2918	B
yeah	2918	B
right that that really sounds good	2918	B
uh i'm a a uh	2918	B
frequent as frequent as possible traveler to the New Orleans area and so we eat a lot of seafood my wife and i eat a lot of seafood when we go down there	2918	B
and uh yeah uh	2918	B
oh did you	2918	B
but uh we we have not been there uh since last summer but uh it's we're looking forward to going back as soon as as we can	2918	B
uh but we eat eat a lot of shrimp and and uh eat oyster dishes and uh	2918	B
we like uh things like uh the poor boy sandwiches with the fried oysters on them course i'm not supposed to eat fried oysters any more but that's uh we like that- that and uh love gumbo	2918	B
and uh	2918	B
yeah	2918	B
right yeah	2918	B
oh yeah so uh	2918	B
but uh but i guess uh my like i said i'm not a cook so my wife probably does or does definitely do you know all of the cooking for you know when we have a dinner party uh	2918	B
i help with- with what i can and uh you know we don't have uh	2918	B
uh something on the order of what you had uh you know it don't main dish and probably some kind of a starch and a vegetable	2918	B
and uh we eat a lot of rice and and uh the the bell peppers that you uh sauteed are just right up our alley we eat a lot of that a lot of mushrooms	2918	B
uh	2918	B
right	2918	B
um-hum	2918	B
yeah	2918	B
yeah	2918	B
yeah	2918	B
yeah if you if you wanted to uh put a little crunchiness in that uh throw a few cashews in it	2918	B
yeah but uh	2918	B
right and uh	2918	B
right the cashew chicken is is i- i really enjoy that	2918	B
oh yeah just	2918	B
right	2918	B
right yes	2918	B
um-hum	2918	B
yeah we uh we also uh uh cook on a do an occasional dish with uh some kind of a Mexican theme	2918	B
and uh we you know have discovered that you can make you know just as good a Mexican food with uh	2918	B
with chicken or with even with turkey we we do cook a lot with turkey and it you can come out with you know good spicy Mexican food	2918	B
and uh and make it chicken or or turkey or something like that instead of going with the beef like when we make fajitas we can make you know chicken fajitas and and enjoy them just as well	2918	B
yeah and uh	2918	B
uh-huh	2918	B
uh-huh	2918	B
yeah	2918	B
right	2918	B
well i think it's everywhere i- i i know that uh	2918	B
oh probably at least half of the people that i know are on some kind of a low fat diet for one reason or another or are low fat or no fat	2918	B
right	2918	B
yeah we have found that uh since we've stopped eating so much beef and pork that when we do eat it it tends to upset our systems	2918	B
and uh you know it's uh my wife in particular when- she uh she said you know when she eats uh some kind of a beef dish	2918	B
if it's the the least bit spicy along with the beef itself that she really her you know her stomach really acts up so	2918	B
so we eat uh eat very little beef and uh we just	2918	B
uh-huh	2918	B
right yeah	2918	B
uh-huh	2918	B
uh-huh	2918	B
um-hum	2918	B
oh	2918	B
yeah i i don't know whether we've tried that or not i i know we've got a we've got a uh is that uh the salt	2918	B
yes i think we've got a	2918	B
uh-huh	2918	B
yeah	2918	B
um-hum	2918	B
yeah you know it's uh about fifteen minutes until noon here and we're talking about food and i'm	2918	B
yeah it's been a it's this is a this is a good timely conversation you know got my appetite going	2918	B
right yeah okay well it's been nice talking to you and uh or maybe we can have a good lunch and and think about it while we're uh about our conversation while we're eating	2918	B
if you don't cook though what do you like to eat if you go to a dinner party	2918	A
um	2918	A
uh-huh	2918	A
uh-huh	2918	A
well uh i was just thinking as i was listening to this recording go over and over till they found a party for me to talk to i could talk about a dinner party i had uh Sunday	2918	A
and it included some seafood so that would probably be uh appropriate for you	2918	A
uh i had uh some people from Germany visiting and they are uh fans of American shrimp	2918	A
so i did a kind of a stir fry dish with shrimp that you shake up in a bag with a little parmesan cheese and flour and then uh quickly	2918	A
uh fry up in a little olive oil and then uh take out of the wok put some uh red strips of red pepper and green pepper in	2918	A
stir that a little bit uh add some uh sliced mushrooms and then put the shrimp back in with a half a cup of white wine and just bring it to a simmer	2918	A
and then you serve it on rice and it's really a a pretty low cholesterol dish	2918	A
because its done with the uh shrimp and the olive oil you don't use any kind of beef fat or	2918	A
no no animal fats in it	2918	A
And it's very popular and it looks very pretty and uh with rice and a salad you've got a a meal	2918	A
um	2918	A
oh that's a good place to get it i miss it i lived in Houston for a long time and we loved to go over to New Orleans to eat	2918	A
uh-huh	2918	A
oh yeah	2918	A
oh yes	2918	A
oh i wish i had the recipe for my grandmother's gumbo she used to make the most wonderful crab meat gumbo with shrimp and all sorts of other goodies in it	2918	A
My job was picking the crab	2918	A
not my favorite part	2918	A
uh-huh	2918	A
uh-huh	2918	A
yeah	2918	A
well the reason for using those is that it makes such a pretty colorful dish People always exclaim when you have the red and green peppers and if i'm making a whole lot uh i use a yellow pepper as well	2918	A
for one pound of shrimp i use one red pepper one green pepper and oh maybe half a dozen ten mushrooms medium sized mushrooms	2918	A
and that's plenty for four people and if they're light eaters you can squeeze in six	2918	A
but	2918	A
oh yeah that's good uh my husband is a Chinese cook he doesn't do much cooking either but he loves to cook Chinese and he has a marvelous uh chicken with cashews and	2918	A
and the Szechuan peppers now those are not the hot ones those are the little round pink ones	2918	A
and oh they are wonderful that uh he does that uh uh chicken with cashews and Szechuan peppers and he also not at the same meal	2918	A
does a wonderful vegetable dish with Szechuan peppers but use that uses either asparagus or um	2918	A
let's see what does he use asparagus is the one we like the best oh broccoli you can do the same dish with broccoli and also if you're really in a pinch you can do it with just celery	2918	A
and it's pretty good	2918	A
uh-huh	2918	A
uh-huh	2918	A
uh-huh	2918	A
oh i like them too i think they're great uh we i've been trying to convince the cook at uh at the place where i work uh we are kind of isolated and so we don't go out to lunch very often	2918	A
and we do have an excellent kitchen uh which is encouraging for people to stay around and uh eat and interact with one another at lunch we're a think tank	2918	A
so that's one of our functions is to get people to talk to each other and she has started cooking uh much healthier food much- much more uh salad without mayonnaise and	2918	A
uh much more uh	2918	A
main dishes without oils and uh and the vegetable i mean and uh animal fats	2918	A
so i think we're improving our diets i don't know whether it's the California influence or whether it's everywhere but	2918	A
uh-huh	2918	A
well my husband's cholesterol is not real high but he his father had uh an early heart attack and so he is very conscious of his	2918	A
uh physical condition and he walks a lot and tries to get uh to stay in pretty good shape and to watch out for high cholesterol and	2918	A
since i prefer the kinds of foods that one eats on a moderately- moderately low cholesterol diet anyway that suits me just fine	2918	A
um yeah yeah	2918	A
uh-huh	2918	A
yeah we don't either we just eat it once in a great while and uh it's usually if we're having company and it's somebody that we know is a big meat fan but there're fewer and fewer of those	2918	A
so we also do an awful lot of cooking when it's just the two of us on a little tiny uh grill it's	2918	A
oh it's less than a foot long and about eight inches wide and uh we just put a few charcoals in there and uh we can cook a piece of chicken we buy boneless chicken breasts and save us ourselves a lot of time	2918	A
And that with uh do have you ever tried Lawrey's Lemon Pepper	2918	A
you can buy it in the grocery store	2918	A
it's a	2918	A
well it has sea salt in it	2918	A
and but it's not the same as uh they have the Lawrey's seasoned salt and the Lawrey's seasoning- Lemon Pepper and the Lemon Pepper's the one i love on chicken and fish	2918	A
and uh yeah just	2918	A
barely brush it with oil grill it uh so it's not too done and sprinkle a little of that on it and then i add some lemon thyme from my garden	2918	A
and that makes an excellent and very easy to fix	2918	A
dinner	2918	A
well i hope you have a nice lunch	2918	A
i'm just looking at our menu unfortunately we're having a terrible lunch here today for the cholesterol people because uh we're going to have Italian sausage and French fries	2918	A
i think i may stick to the salad bar today	2918	A
nice to talk to you too	2918	A
okay bye-bye	2918	A
oh	2943	B
yes i do i have five	2943	B
um both ends actually	2943	B
i tended in my home for about twelve years	2943	B
and uh	2943	B
uh	2943	B
when i was looking for child care	2943	B
i've never had to uh	2943	B
uh it's been the situation where i had to	2943	B
put my own children in child care thank goodness	2943	B
i was uh	2943	B
i was um i've always been very grateful for that	2943	B
excuse me just a minute	2943	B
i'm sorry	2943	B
but it has been a a factor my youngest is now in a uh a preschool which is different than	2943	B
day care i guess you know per say	2943	B
um-hum	2943	B
um-hum	2943	B
oh it's very hard it's very hard	2943	B
i always felt like i ran a real tip top in home	2943	B
child care i think there are advantages to to child care in the home but oh i'd be very very careful if i were putting my own children in a home	2943	B
they uh and even if you get a place that's just perfect just perfect you know it's clean and the people are responsible and and the uh	2943	B
the other kids are decent and there are programs provided and foods done properly and all those kinds of things that you think of you know to to worry about	2943	B
i	2943	B
you know you your children build bonds with those kids that are there	2943	B
and yet	2943	B
and- and they're usually very young preschool age	2943	B
and yet when that's gone	2943	B
you don't you don't even know who those other mothers are chances are they're like little cousins you know or brothers and sisters and yet they never see one another again	2943	B
so you know i think that's a	2943	B
uh that's a factor too	2943	B
most of my uh i come from a family of nine children	2943	B
myself my own you know children my uh nuclear family	2943	B
and most of us have somehow been able to work out	2943	B
either aunts and uncles uh	2943	B
siblings	2943	B
you know older siblings younger siblings you know some of us have uh have have had children that were quite stretched out in age or	2943	B
situations where you know kind of joint where mothers worked at night or you know alternated or dad worked out of the home so he could tend the kids- you know different things and um	2943	B
not very many of us have had to actually have that full day every day	2943	B
day care in a herd kind of situation and the one	2943	B
i think so	2943	B
well and at the time that i was doing you know in home child care i- i felt real strongly you know that that was a needed to be a real viable opportunity for parents to	2943	B
to have that option that they didn't feel you know a lot of people most people cannot afford to have a nanny	2943	B
or a governess you know type situation where that	2943	B
housekeeper someone in the home their own home is tending to their own children	2943	B
day in and day out that's just a luxury most people can't afford if they could afford that they probably wouldn't be going to work except for the person who's got a career you know who's um i think more and more i think uh we're going to see	2943	B
child care change i think there's going to be more corporate involvement i think we're going to see a lot more um	2943	B
paternity leave and options that involve the dads more	2943	B
flex times	2943	B
yeah yeah	2943	B
um-hum	2943	B
well basically you know we already have my husband works for a large uh oil corporation	2943	B
and they have you know a deduction kind of plan where it's tax free you know if you put it in ahead of time yeah	2943	B
i think that's	2943	B
um-hum um-hum	2943	B
and on site care	2943	B
those kinds of	2943	B
no no they don't i'm saying i think that is one of one way of the future that we will see	2943	B
and and much needed i	2943	B
i like to see those kinds of things that emphasize the family unity rather than	2943	B
you know yeah	2943	B
because we just have a generation of people that are not going to be happy with	2943	B
either parent	2943	B
not when and our economy is almost precludes	2943	B
one person staying home if they stay home they've still got to contribute somehow	2943	B
you know financially	2943	B
um-hum um-hum	2943	B
yeah	2943	B
yeah	2943	B
they say probably eighty percent	2943	B
well	2943	B
um-hum um-hum	2943	B
um-hum um-hum	2943	B
um-hum	2943	B
i read the most interesting article here oh gosh it's been about two months ago right around Easter time i remember thinking it	2943	B
was when i read it	2943	B
about a husband and a wife that honest and truly share the same job for Arco Oil and Gas	2943	B
i'm trying to think it was computer related they were both over a department he worked one week she works the next they have two children	2943	B
how very unusual you know i mean for to find two people who even could do the same job or have the same education to do it but they'd met on site you know and	2943	B
the relationship developed and you know they married and	2943	B
that would support it and the uh	2943	B
course you always wonder you know when you read it in the newspaper is it really all you know	2943	B
did they just ignore half the team who can't stand this arrangements but the team members that were interviewed all seemed to be very supportive of it and uh	2943	B
and said that their that their management styles meshed real well	2943	B
and	2943	B
isn't that interesting very novel you know	2943	B
you know you hear of women you know maybe like on flex time thing you know but you're talking file clerk i mean you know you're not talking	2943	B
you know	2943	B
both with master's degrees yeah	2943	B
um-hum um-hum our uh our dentists are husband and wife team work out of the same office	2943	B
yeah and uh they have children	2943	B
that's	2943	B
and yet it's worth it	2943	B
it truly is worth it you know there are some days when you wonder if it is but you know face it you know the	2943	B
population is decreasing you know and somebody's going to have these little babies and	2943	B
oh yes my uh my big ones are wonderful to help with my little one and uh	2943	B
we are we're to the point now where we only have one that has to be sat like you would say baby sitting or tending but i still believe that it's very important that moms be in the home in the afternoon	2943	B
when those kids come home from school and stuff that's just	2943	B
you know that's i think it's just as critical for middle school and high schoolers as it is	2943	B
there we go um normally it takes me a lot longer to get through but this is pretty quick do you have children	2943	A
oh	2943	A
oh my goodness well then you've obviously had some experience with child care	2943	A
really uh what do you mean	2943	A
oh wow	2943	A
now what did you look for when you were looking for child care	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
oh it it	2943	A
it um-hum	2943	A
yeah that's nice	2943	A
lucky	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
that's okay	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
uh-huh	2943	A
um	2943	A
well what you know i work in a personnel agency and um so i'm constantly interviewing and placing people in jobs	2943	A
and i've just really become discouraged in people's own sense of responsibility and dependability	2943	A
um and what what's hard for me is i don't have children but i would imagine once i do i'm probably going to need to find some sort of child care	2943	A
and it worries me it worries me a lot because i just um i- i don't- i don't know who i could feel comfortable trusting my children with It	2943	A
it i yeah	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
i know	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
um-hum um-hum	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
yeah	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
um-hum yeah	2943	A
i know oh i know	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
oh it certainly is um	2943	A
and um-hum	2943	A
oh wow	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
that's great	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
well	2943	A
not only yeah- not only does that make you uh just have you know more peace of mind but isn't that great for the child too	2943	A
to not be with strangers and even though they're you know getting to know the people and it's probably good for them to you know be out of the house and all that but just to have a parent with them so few families are able to do that these days	2943	A
that the fact that you're able to do it and and that your siblings could that's just wonderful	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
um-hum yeah	2943	A
oh yeah	2943	A
right	2943	A
um-hum um-hum	2943	A
definitely um-hum	2943	A
definitely and we're going to see more like you were saying corporate i think we're going to see more uh maybe even a corporate contribution i mean just companies helping to to pay for it because it's just not	2943	A
uh it's a necessity	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
yes that's what we do here	2943	A
uh-huh	2943	A
pre tax dollars that that you're yeah that's what- that's what we have here well	2943	A
uh-huh	2943	A
oh they do have on site care	2943	A
oh i'm sorry	2943	A
oh	2943	A
um-hum boy yeah	2943	A
sending people off and	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
oh i know	2943	A
um-hum yes	2943	A
yeah oh yeah um and and i guess you know it's just it's too scary to be reading the papers and hearing on the news they always say that um you know	2943	A
all these horrible things happen in the most comfortable places like uh sexually abused children it's happening with a neighbor or with somebody that they think they knew well and trusted um and	2943	A
that's the scary thing is that you think okay these people are good because you can trust them and and all that then they're the ones that might you know turn around and	2943	A
and be the ones that cause the problem	2943	A
it's it's really scary it's um	2943	A
i my husband is a professor or i should say he will be a professor	2943	A
and um i'm looking forward to his schedule being flexible and to mine and- you know at some point being flexible so that we can sort of juggle our own schedules around and and create some sort of way that we can	2943	A
be around you know not necessarily at the same time but at least one of us be there one woman that we have in our office um he works during the day and she works in the evenings part-time	2943	A
and so you know even though she's only working part-time she's not spending money on the day care so it's almost like you're not um you know maybe you're not making as much but you're not spending as much either	2943	A
yeah	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
oh my goodness	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
oh wow	2943	A
isn't that ideal	2943	A
yes	2943	A
right	2943	A
right	2943	A
and a company that can allow that yeah	2943	A
right is this true or what	2943	A
um-hum that is- what a neat idea	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
wow that's amazing	2943	A
yes that is very good i like that um it's	2943	A
right	2943	A
yeah i know you're not	2943	A
isn't that interesting wow i would imagine that must be hard to to not bring your work home though you know um they probably	2943	A
oh really oh	2943	A
well that's that's good i mean if some couples want to do that i think that's great and uh you you just got to change your life around somehow when you're going to have kids no question about it	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
yeah	2943	A
yeah um-hum	2943	A
yeah now do you- are your kids is are your older ones at an age where they're taking care of the younger ones yet or oh they are	2943	A
oh good	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
yeah- yeah	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
um-hum	2943	A
no actually i'm a spectator and i'm a second hand spectator as a result of my first husband's or my late- late husband's interest in golf	2983	A
um-hum	2983	A
i can't even play miniature golf well well there are just some things that we're good at and other things that we're not but i am very good at watching it on television	2983	A
and he was really uh enthusiastic about keeping up with the tournaments he could tell me exactly what day and what time of year and where the tournaments were going to be held and what the nature of the hole was and	2983	A
oh yeah he was a good golfer	2983	A
and as and did some you know instructions at the country club for a while	2983	A
but uh golf tended to be so- i am not really deeply involved in any following any of the sports	2983	A
but golf was one that i developed a working knowledge of a lot of the golfers and therefore i enjoyed following those particular players	2983	A
uh-huh	2983	A
well part of it was the personality and their sportsmanship another part of it was i'd pick one out that was different than what my husband was rooting for so you know the competitor and i became involved in following his career	2983	A
and uh i know that that my husband Tom Kite was his fair haired boy and he thought he was spectacular i said whoa i'm not going to i'm not going to stay interested in him so	2983	A
i decided Andy Bean was good competition any time they both played why he was just real excited when Tom was you know shown on the television and	2983	A
i followed Andy Bean	2983	A
we both followed Lee Trevino into the Seniors	2983	A
he is he is a character not just a golfer but he's quite a character	2983	A
and there are some really really	2983	A
wonderful people in the game of golf who do give wonderful role models	2983	A
and i think it's critical it's critical to have a good role model	2983	A
in any field any sports	2983	A
uh-huh	2983	A
uh-huh	2983	A
well i myself really have not seen a whole lot of point to the game of golf you hit a little ball you chase it you go find it and then you hit it again and lose it again	2983	A
and i know the whole point is to get it in that little bitty hole but seems to me like if they made the hole bigger it'd be easier	2983	A
oh i know oh yeah	2983	A
um-hum um-hum	2983	A
oh yeah well my husband's average ran in the mid seventies so he wasn't bad	2983	A
he was pretty good but as far as influencing young people i think that that is uh that is one of the sports that you can carry into old age you can't play football at fifty five	2983	A
but it is a good healthy wholesome lifestyle and- uh anything can be warped	2983	A
but i think that that is one of the sports that's a good healthy way to to move into maturity safely um-hum um-hum	2983	A
that's right that's right and a lot of seniors a lot of elderly people don't even take up golf until they're you know in their later years	2983	A
that's right that's absolutely right and it's something that	2983	A
yeah when you're too old to do anything else go play golf yeah but it's it's also something that husband and wife can participate in	2983	A
or you can both enjoy the same sport and participate in separate circles	2983	A
you know you can go to the country club together you can play with your friends he can play with his friends but you've both been out and exercised and you have enjoyed the day	2983	A
um-hum well i'll tell you what if	2983	A
if they're not real good golfers sometimes it is not fun to ride around and listen to their exclamations all day long	2983	A
um-hum	2983	A
oh mine had a very short fuse if he did something bad he's liable to take that club and throw it as far as he can throw it he's replaced almost as many clubs as he has balls i mean just get so mad he'd just wham that club up against a tree and break that rascal	2983	A
uh-huh	2983	A
uh-huh	2983	A
uh-huh	2983	A
uh-huh	2983	A
uh-huh well i shot in the hundreds but i made this one good one	2983	A
um-hum	2983	A
well the one thing that is a is a drawback about it i think is the cost	2983	A
membership in the clubs is expensive the equipment is very expensive requires special shoes requires special you know special equipment there's so many	2983	A
that's right	2983	A
that's right that's right it it can get very expensive and i can imagine what kind of costs are involved if you're going to try to go pro because_1 you spend hours and hours and hours practicing	2983	A
and they don't give those sessions away and nor do they give uh instructions away	2983	A
as a matter of fact a friend of mine asked me if i thought i'd be interested in golf i said i don't know i'll have to try it and see i've always watched it and he said well fine he said we'll just take you over to the course he lives near Brookhaven	2983	A
we'll just take you over to the course and get you some lessons and let you see if you like it if you do then we can go golf together	2983	A
i said oh whoa great i get to walk all around a little green field all day	2983	A
but those kinds of things happen though you you get a little taste of it and you say hey this is not bad	2983	A
and you really begin to develop an interest in it but i am not an athlete at all uh you know i'm always the one that got hit by the bat in baseball and	2983	A
and uh hung- hung- hung my fingernails in the net in volleyball so i am not an athlete maybe golf is a forgiving sport i don't know	2983	A
it doesn't appear to be	2983	A
um-hum i really i i haven't really acquired an interest in it but i'm open to try anything you know	2983	A
the one thing that is also detrimental as far i'm concerned my skin is very fair so i'm going to have to golf in the evening or i'm going to have to golf at a time when the heat of the day does not cook me and i don't think-	2983	A
okay is uh that a sport you like to participate in	2983	B
uh-huh my husband likes golf also he's uh i guess he'd be a fanatic if he thought he could get away with it but he he limits it pretty good i um	2983	B
have tried to go out and play golf he would love it if i would go out and play with him but i stand there and swing and swing and i can't even hit the ball yeah i don't either	2983	B
right um-hum	2983	B
oh so he's really into it wow	2983	B
oh	2983	B
yeah	2983	B
right more because of their personalities than their sportsman	2983	B
right	2983	B
oh	2983	B
uh-huh	2983	B
uh-huh	2983	B
oh he's interesting i like to watch him yeah	2983	B
yeah	2983	B
yes yeah i think you're right	2983	B
yeah	2983	B
yeah yeah	2983	B
i like to watch those skins games do you ever watch those where they just play for a certain amount- you know for each hole they win they get the money for it i think those are pretty exciting	2983	B
uh-huh	2983	B
yeah	2983	B
oh really i sometimes wonder why men like it so much because they get so frustrated and mad at themselves when they don't do well	2983	B
my husband and his buddies are not very good they play like maybe once a month or less and uh so they all hit like in the low nineties and they think they're having a really good game so	2983	B
wow yeah that is good	2983	B
right	2983	B
yeah	2983	B
uh-huh something to stay active at and- for a long time	2983	B
yeah yeah	2983	B
yeah and they can still get good at it	2983	B
yeah	2983	B
um-hum	2983	B
true	2983	B
right yeah or my favorite just ride around in the cart with him	2983	B
go somewhere really nice like Hawaii and just look at the golf course	2983	B
oh yeah no my husband's pretty tolerant so he's not too bad to watch	2983	B
oh no yeah	2983	B
gosh now my husband has a temper but he doesn't seem to show it on the golf course he's because_1 he'll talk about the other guys he plays with doing that and how immature- immature he thought it was and stuff so i guess he's real laid back about it	2983	B
he he'll come home though and i mean he'll shoot when he was shooting in the hundreds and he'd tell me what a great day he had and about this great shot he made and everything i try not to laugh yeah this one on this one hole	2983	B
did you have to listen to long stories about how on the seventeenth hole i hit it and went this way those are it's hard for me to act nice about that when he goes on and on	2983	B
yes	2983	B
right and then they want to play another course that's not they're not a member of and other fees it really is high	2983	B
yeah	2983	B
oh yeah	2983	B
yeah	2983	B
right	2983	B
uh-huh	2983	B
uh-huh	2983	B
uh-huh	2983	B
uh-huh	2983	B
me either	2983	B
yeah at least you're just competing- you're competing against yourself i guess more than everybody else out there yeah	2983	B
yeah that's kind of the way i feel	2983	B
oh	2983	B
right	2983	B
um what do you think the major cause of air pollution or at least in the Boston areas	2998	A
um-hum	2998	A
yeah yeah	2998	A
um that isn't the same in the Washington area because we don't have any major um industry except for uh government and services	2998	A
and the the transportation situation is such that uh all the car pollution is is absolutely awful	2998	A
um also the worth of the hub of three airports in this general area there is uh National Dulles and then uh Baltimore Washington	2998	A
and it interestingly some of the information i've been reading indicates that the amount of air pollution from uh uh airplanes is extraordinary	2998	A
yeah and that's always something that you know you just don't real you don't think about	2998	A
uh but the uh apparently the air pollution and the fact that it's delivered right up in high altitudes is a very significant factor	2998	A
um	2998	A
yeah yeah	2998	A
um-hum	2998	A
society has especially recently	2998	A
i mean you know what it's like here	2998	A
yeah yeah yeah we just had the	2998	A
that's right so solutions to this would be i- i you know improved	2998	A
well i guess the first- the to me the first thing is i wish society would get as upset about this as you do get getting people upset about animal rights	2998	A
i mean this is so so basic it's human rights in the sense	2998	A
but uh in terms of demanding it's just not caused but demanding that um	2998	A
uh we can spend so much money on certain things but	2998	A
that research really be directed toward um improvement of polluting vehicles and not just cars but also buses um planes	2998	A
that something can be done i mean- i can't imagine that well if we can't send people to the moon that we can't improve these things	2998	A
converter yeah um-hum	2998	A
um-hum	2998	A
and that uh for buses	2998	A
that's right well and also to make it economically feasible	2998	A
uh and particular- also in buses i don't know if you ever got caught in a traffic jam behind a bus	2998	A
that you know	2998	A
um-hum yeah	2998	A
um-hum uh-hum	2998	A
yeah but even of course in the longer term just to get away from fossil fuels	2998	A
i mean i'm i'm thinking of research in that direction rather than we we've taken the intermediate step but i don't think fossil fuels are the answer	2998	A
um-hum	2998	A
yes i mean-	2998	A
yeah	2998	A
yeah you don't throw the baby out with the bath water and condemning nuclear use	2998	A
yeah yeah	2998	A
but with the pollution issue uh fossil fuel is not the way to go anyway	2998	A
uh so you've to look- you've got to look elsewhere so uh but it is something that's a little frightening and in fact well i within our family we have said- said my husband i have two sons uh well one one is already in college in New England	2998	A
and the other will be going in September and we just feel that when we leave uh this area we're- we're going north not south	2998	A
uh i like the mentality north and i also like the fresher air up there	2998	A
so i mean that's the way we will be going	2998	A
but um so i- i i'd be interested in having spoken with somebody also from the far west on this issue to see how they their attitudes are	2998	A
um-hum	2998	A
um-hum	2998	A
the smog and yeah	2998	A
um-hum yeah	2998	A
i mean even California was notorious for its smog years ago before it even was an issue out here	2998	A
well that that's that's personal- that's personal air pollution	2998	A
yes yes	2998	A
yeah well i- i definetely- definitely advance that well listen i enjoyed speaking with you and let's hope some there are other people that feel the same way	2998	A
you're welcome bye-bye	2998	A
well the the the major- major- major cause it seems up here is simply- i live right on the ocean so	2998	B
it's kind of hard for me to tell what would happen if i lived in some of the valleys inland but the major cause here and we always seem to and it seems to be validated by the press is the car pollution we don't have too much industrial pollution	2998	B
uh car pollution seems to be the one and only thing that that i can really put my finger on here	2998	B
is that so i didn't know that	2998	B
well most people talk about the noise pollution from airplanes rather than the air pollution	2998	B
yeah	2998	B
i would think so you know uh i- i guess it talked about all types of pollution i happen to read- just read something the other day	2998	B
at least in the Boston paper there were three things that that come to note one is that the carbon fluorides that are	2998	B
uh being released into the atmosphere are causing even a larger hole in the southern hemisphere in the ozone layer and again and now they've located another one or rather an expanding one in the northern hemisphere so car	2998	B
so i'm quite concerned i don't think it's involved any longer with	2998	B
with uh hair sprays or those those- no i think it's now is what uh from what i understand it's air conditioning units and and we certainly turned into an air conditioned society	2998	B
yeah i know in Florida there's no place you go that isn't air conditioned and i do quite a bit of business in Washington and	2998	B
oh yeah it's quite is is the it's really out of the norm not to find something that isn't air conditioned	2998	B
and and i guess refrigerators are the same way they release that	2998	B
yeah	2998	B
well	2998	B
yeah	2998	B
well i- i think- yeah	2998	B
no i think that it can be done simply because uh uh we've we've every car now in America that's been produced for the past fifteen years has what they call a catalytic converter	2998	B
and no lead gas was came to the pumps and and that's been done there's the lead pollution has that problem essentially i guess because it was at crisis proportions was was licked	2998	B
and i think that there are there- there are solutions certainly we don't even need a need a research anymore it's just a matter of passing the law and passing the law depends on how heavy the car industry the automobile lobby is	2998	B
that's right that's right	2998	B
oh yeah well that that the the smell is awful and but you know i was reading the other day not to go on with this but that diesel fumes actually have less pollutants in them than gasoline fumes	2998	B
yeah	2998	B
well we you know up here in New England uh where i've right close to where i live is the Seabrook Nucleus site which is practically a you know guerrilla war up here went on for years	2998	B
uh my- my daughters marched in the uh uh against the Seabrook and i kind of uh my feelings were that we needed this bridge to to uh to	2998	B
jump from whatever it was going to be from fossil fuel to whatever it was going to be	2998	B
yeah unfortunately- unfortunately- unfortunately though i think the oil companies have lied to us for years	2998	B
so we really don't know whether there's enough fossil fuel left or there isn't and uh and uh i	2998	B
no	2998	B
yeah	2998	B
yeah	2998	B
yes	2998	B
that's right	2998	B
yeah	2998	B
well since since Texas and Louisiana and uh California that in that ranking order the worst pollutants in America	2998	B
i mean i read that the other day i mean Louisiana- Louisiana for a small state was- it was amazing but it's the industrial pollution i should imagine and California seems to be taking steps i mean	2998	B
you you read about the the fairly fairly stiff laws they put in on cars now they're they're enforcing but uh again uh that didn't occur without a crisis nothing will occur i guess without a crisis	2998	B
yeah exactly exactly	2998	B
but that to me was pollution	2998	B
that was its most personal personal uh pollution that i can think of	2998	B
surely	2998	B
something happen right on thank you bye-bye	2998	B
okay have you participated in anything like that	2994	B
um-hum uh we we have a pretty nice recycling center uh in our city now and we take the newspapers and plastic and glass	2994	B
up there they're open like two days a week and you can just take it up there and drop it off it's kind of fun and everybody up there looks pleased with themselves when they're taking their stuff in like they're doing something good to	2994	B
help the earth i guess	2994	B
yeah	2994	B
every time he turns around i'm giving him some new rule that we're you're supposed to squish up the you know like collapse the plastic jugs instead of taking them_1 up there solid	2994	B
and i wish that our recycling center took paper bags they won't take those	2994	B
we like to put our just put our newspapers in a paper bag you know and then carry them_1 up there that way and we have to bring the paper bags back every time	2994	B
but they won't take them do you um take your papers somewhere or does someone pick them up	2994	B
uh-huh	2994	B
we um we don't take our cans up to that center though our aluminum cans we like to take them to one of the places where they pay you for them_1	2994	B
uh-huh	2994	B
yeah it takes us about a year to save up enough to be worth	2994	B
yeah worth bothering to go in and do	2994	B
do you um have any ideas on anything that would make	2994	B
uh-huh	2994	B
right	2994	B
yeah that'd be a good idea	2994	B
yeah	2994	B
right	2994	B
yeah that would be a real good motivation for people	2994	B
right	2994	B
yeah my father was telling me about some program he read about where you buy your bags	2994	B
like you buy your garbage bag from the city and you pay more than just what you would pay for an empty garbage bag but then you don't pay any monthly fee or anything so however many bags of garbage you throw away that's how many you have to pay for	2994	B
yeah	2994	B
yeah that would be a real good idea	2994	B
i'm trying to think if there's anything else i could think of they're talking about going to curbside pickup in our in our city Rowlett Texas do you know do you where that is	2994	B
and i don't know if they decided to do or not but i think they said it was gonna add like either a dollar or three dollars a month to your bill	2994	B
to have them do that although i think a lot of those programs can operate at about a break even	2994	B
break even point without charging people yeah	2994	B
i don't know um	2994	B
since they just have to hire someone to man it a few hours a week	2994	B
and they sell i guess they sell everything to some waste company that comes and gets it	2994	B
but i wish that uh	2994	B
uh more of the cans you know like the cans you buy vegetables and fruit and stuff like that in were recyclable i don't a lot of that's that recyclable steel and i don't know anybody that takes that	2994	B
the- my husband likes Pepsi and those cans are steel instead of aluminum so we can't can't ever recycle those i think it's a good reason to quit buying it	2994	B
yeah that's what we buy the most of unless we're going on a trip or something where we want to put the cans in a cooler	2994	B
but	2994	B
well that's all i can really think about for recycling it was good talking to you um bye	2994	B
well a little bit we mostly do our newspapers we keep our newspapers and stuff like that and we take them to be recycled	2994	A
um-hum	2994	A
yeah	2994	A
and a lot of people complain because_1 it's really not convenient for them	2994	A
you're supposed to what	2994	A
but what are you supposed to do with them	2994	A
oh okay	2994	A
uh-huh	2994	A
yeah	2994	A
we we usually collect a you know collect a quite a bit and then we take them_1 take them_1 in	2994	A
yeah we don't we don't um use aluminum cans so	2994	A
we generally don't have those to do	2994	A
you know they they charge you you know it's like a flat rate i think for picking up your garbage	2994	A
and	2994	A
i know a lot of people it would would solve the convenience problem if they had curbside pickup and some communities are trying to do that now and i think that maybe if they only charged	2994	A
for	2994	A
the garbage that you did not sort and have set up for recycling	2994	A
they they charged you by by weight of how much trash you were actually sending to a landfill	2994	A
that that might be a better way to do it and then people would would know that it was gonna cost them money to not sort their trash	2994	A
you know because_1 then it would then it would make monetary sense to them you know to say hey you know if i just spend the time to to sort this out where this stuff can be recycled then i don't have to pay for them_1 hauling it off	2994	A
uh-huh	2994	A
oh yeah that's about the same kind of thing	2994	A
where do you live	2994	A
oh okay yes	2994	A
it seems like they would be able to	2994	A
uh-huh	2994	A
yeah	2994	A
yeah	2994	A
yeah that's true this	2994	A
hm nah i didn't know that because_1 we just usually if we're gonna um buy sodas they're in the the two liter bottles	2994	A
yeah	2994	A
okay	2994	A
okay all right bye-bye	2994	A
well i think we pay too much in taxes how about_1 you	2915	A
excuse me	2915	A
yeah that's what i think too i don't know how you feel um we moved here from another state we've lived here before went out and came back and that particular state had an occupational income tax but no sales tax	2915	A
and what you find out is there's one evil's the same as the other here you don't there's no occupational tax but it's a heavy sales tax so they get you coming and going	2915	A
yeah its really i know it's just um	2915	A
yeah it is i was shocked i went we bought a new washer and the man said and that's eight percent i said eight percent what so it's really kind of sad yeah	2915	A
and then i don't know how you know in terms of when you all do your federal but it just seems like if you're strictly middle income it seems like you get hit the worst	2915	A
is that what you think	2915	A
um-hum	2915	A
doesn't seem quite fair does it because_1 they have the money to shelter things and i don't know somehow get a huh	2915	A
oh i thought you were going to say something they somehow seem to get around the the things that we can't you know that make don't make that kind of money	2915	A
i don't know	2915	A
um-hum i know and just somehow it doesn't seem you know and- and they're not- you mean you look at somebody like uh that country singer uh what's his name Willie Nelson	2915	A
i was reading about him in the paper and i said well you know he knew he was making money somebody- he didn't look that stupid why didn't he pay his taxes you know	2915	A
in a way it's almost like he had so much debt that uh filing bankruptcy was a way to get out of all of it you know so	2915	A
do you file federal or a joint income tax or do you	2915	A
and do you feel like you get hit by you know too much	2915	A
um-hum and we right now we don't own any property we lease so we're in the same- we don't have children so we're in the same kind of it's not as bad as being single and divorced but it's sort of like if you have like X point five children and own you know	2915	A
you kind of get hit with you know i i mean it doesn't even pay for me to earn a good wage because and that sounds stupid but i mean there's actually less tax implication if i don't work full time compared to what my husband does you know	2915	A
so it's kind of hard	2915	A
excuse me	2915	A
uh-huh	2915	A
right yeah otherwise you're just you know and if you have kids you get like seven hundred fifty dollars or something	2915	A
oh it is oh oh my well that's not too bad	2915	A
uh-huh	2915	A
oh my goodness	2915	A
yeah i guess that's my call i guess i better go	2915	A
okay well it was nice talking to you uh-huh bye-bye	2915	A
yeah	2915	B
well i think they waste what we pay	2915	B
i think they waste what what- all the money that we pay	2915	B
um-hum	2915	B
um-hum	2915	B
no it's even it's even higher in Dallas County so was it	2915	B
eight and a quarter i think	2915	B
um-hum	2915	B
yeah	2915	B
yeah because it -different at some point it goes up to thirty three percent and then the people that make you know five hundred thousand dollars and and and higher than that they don't have to pay sometimes they have- to pay even less taxes	2915	B
no it isn't	2915	B
what	2915	B
no	2915	B
right	2915	B
i mean if they're in business and and they're making money i- i could see if they're losing money but they're making money then they should pay taxes then	2915	B
um-hum	2915	B
right um-hum	2915	B
right	2915	B
i just file federal income tax every year	2915	B
yeah i just got divorced so i'm single again so and you know it's it's it's a lot worse for single people because_1 they pay the same amount as as the people that make the same amount of money and they're married that-	2915	B
um-hum	2915	B
um-hum	2915	B
right	2915	B
whoever works less they get a tax credit for that	2915	B
if both of the both of the spouses work then you get a tax credit for that um-hum	2915	B
well it's two thousand now yeah for everybody	2915	B
um-hum	2915	B
then you get a you get a child care exemption but it's not enough you know i mean you pay from fifty to a hundred dollars a week in child care and and they only give you like	2915	B
well- i think it's about five or ten percent of that you know it doesn't even it's not even	2915	B
oh okay	2915	B
nice talking to you bye-bye	2915	B
do you use your credit cards very often	2987	A
okay is that just out of habit or convenience	2987	A
uh-huh	2987	A
okay i don't use uh gasoline credit cards i used to have one	2987	A
but i didn't use it uh i used it so seldom that i'd get letters from Mobil uh reminding me that i had a credit card to use	2987	A
right so you basically use them_1 as an alternative to carrying cash	2987	A
are you uh solicited a lot uh for other uh credit cards	2987	A
what-	2987	A
what uh criteria do you consider on whether or not you'll accept a particular card	2987	A
yeah i won't get a card if there's an annual fee	2987	A
right	2987	A
yeah i	2987	A
i- i think that Texan's is charging thirteen point nine percent uh interest	2987	A
it could be could be i don't uh use them_1 often enough to even keep tabs on it	2987	A
but most of them charge between eighteen and twenty one percent per year	2987	A
i think that's	2987	A
right right	2987	A
and i look for a grace period too so that they don't charge interest on from from the day of purchase	2987	A
and of course no annual fee	2987	A
well i- i think it just generates revenue for the companies that uh for the banks that sponsor the credit cards	2987	A
no	2987	A
uh i get uh applications for cards from oh different places for various reasons uh i got an application from Home Depot for their card	2987	A
and uh the incentive there was that they'd give you ten percent off on your first purchase with that credit card	2987	A
so i got that card just so i could uh make a major purchase	2987	A
right and get a discount on it	2987	A
i did- did the same thing with uh Foley's they uh	2987	A
uh had a fifteen percent discount on a purchase if you just apply for a card	2987	A
yeah uh-huh	2987	A
yeah	2987	A
yeah i always maintain a zero balance uh i don't like owing anybody anything	2987	A
if you want to borrow money there're better ways to do it uh i think you can get a loan through the credit union for about uh oh i don't know nine or ten percent now i guess	2987	A
and uh keeping a credit cards uh charged up is just uh	2987	A
not a very good way to uh to make- to make use of borrowing money	2987	A
yeah it's the buy now pay later plan and uh live for today	2987	A
nobody bothers saving any money	2987	A
yeah	2987	A
sure	2987	A
oh yeah	2987	A
right	2987	A
yeah well there's a	2987	A
a basic problem too with not using credit cards that they are good credit references	2987	A
when i closed on my house mortgage uh the mortgage company was looking for uh references credit references and i didn't have any credit cards charged up at all i keep the balance paid off so they make lousy credit reference then	2987	A
right	2987	A
when the balance is zero it doesn't help much	2987	A
i get a lot of uh pre approved applications from various organizations and i throw all those out	2987	A
right	2987	A
right uh-huh	2987	A
yeah uh-huh	2987	A
um-hum	2987	A
yeah i think you're right	2987	A
uh	2987	A
i	2987	A
well uh funny thing about the Discover card is i just pulled a uh one dollar check from them out of my briefcase today that expired uh last month i didn't cash it	2987	A
uh they- they sent me a dollar uh refund from last year's purchase i- i used it one time	2987	A
and uh i got a dollar credit a dollar check but i didn't uh cash the check and the check expired but on my last statement i noticed that they credited my account with a dollar credit	2987	A
could very well be	2987	A
i've got so many uh well i don't have a lot of cards but i've got a lot that i never used	2987	A
uh i stick basically with uh the Texan's MasterCard	2987	A
and uh very seldom use the American Express card	2987	A
sure corporate card	2987	A
i would never pay thirty five dollars or more a year for uh use of a card	2987	A
um no not really we use gas cards more than anything	2987	B
uh	2987	B
basically convenience	2987	B
uh which led to habit i guess	2987	B
oh really	2987	B
yeah we don't we don't ever we don't carry a whole lot of cash with us so we use the the gas cards because_1 our families are both out of	2987	B
town and like when we travel and stuff we	2987	B
use the gas cards	2987	B
yeah yeah	2987	B
and then we have a	2987	B
an American Express that's through TI that	2987	B
Steve uses just for TI stuff	2987	B
yes	2987	B
yes a lot	2987	B
uh probably the uh	2987	B
uh if there's a premium each year and the uh	2987	B
the APR	2987	B
and there's it's it's kind of hard to beat TI	2987	B
and so uh you know usually we just trash it just tear it up and trash it and-	2987	B
most- most of the time it goes unopened	2987	B
yeah if if that much	2987	B
they're thirteen something but i'm not sure if it's i think it's a flat thirteen right now	2987	B
yeah	2987	B
yeah	2987	B
and then you're- then you're if you're that lucky you get to pay them another twenty five bucks a year just to be that privileged to get twenty one percent a year	2987	B
yeah	2987	B
yeah	2987	B
yeah that would that would help a lot i i'm not even sure why i mean the purpose of an annual fee i'm not really	2987	B
well i guess so because_1 it's not any more prestigious to have to pay it	2987	B
uh as far as getting another card where you don't i mean you know	2987	B
oh really	2987	B
yeah	2987	B
have ten percent off but you got to use that credit card	2987	B
right yeah that	2987	B
yeah	2987	B
right i did that with my husband uh he was off working at TI in Austin one day and so i went out to the mall to kind of look around hit Mervyn's	2987	B
and found some stuff- stuff after Christmas on sale and ended up getting fifteen percent off already off of it already whatever it was lower and i think that's the only card i have that's	2987	B
you know recently is gotten a Mervyn's card and i used it for i think for the first time when i was in Houston this weekend and i have i've had it for months	2987	B
yeah yeah i don't i don't like it a whole lot either	2987	B
yeah yeah	2987	B
yeah i never understood how people could i mean there are some people who say well i can't charge it it's at it's limit and i thought God how can you charge a credit card to its limit	2987	B
it just it just i guess it's that that you know lack of discipline when you have a piece of plastic that says pay later you know	2987	B
yeah and i just it's that	2987	B
yeah it just borrow- worry about it tomorrow	2987	B
yeah and it just i don't i don't really go for them_1 and i in fact i had my own before we got married and ended up cutting them_1 up just for the fact that TI had lower rates	2987	B
you know and decided and i mean when i tried to close with Chase Manhattan it was just like pulling teeth	2987	B
i mean i couldn't close they'd send me a statement every little this is your new	2987	B
you know balance with bonus points or whatever you know and it's like look i closed this months ago and i don't want any more of your letters i don't want anything and well you have a credit balance well send me a check you know	2987	B
yeah	2987	B
yeah	2987	B
yeah	2987	B
yeah they do but we we were in in that same boat a couple of years ago and they had said well	2987	B
just list your major ones and and the balance still owed on it you know or give it a balance still owed on it and	2987	B
that's all we did	2987	B
right	2987	B
yeah and it's like well who are you to approve something for me without my permission anyway	2987	B
but i think um i think what you can do as far as	2987	B
i don't think as many companies	2987	B
when you are a good customer i don't think they report that as much as they should their delinquent customers	2987	B
because a lot of times you have to write and ask them to report it to the credit bureau so that you look like you have good credit	2987	B
as far as you know paying off you know your cards early or on time or whatever	2987	B
that usually doesn't happen unless i've heard people say well you have to write to ask that and i say well you know if someone's so quick to turn you over because you're thirty days late	2987	B
i think they should- they should do do that more often	2987	B
what do you think about that uh Discover card	2987	B
oh really	2987	B
the dollar you didn't cash	2987	B
oh oh well i was wondering how that that worked because it's like you know we'll pay you for and i'm going wait a minute	2987	B
you know	2987	B
yeah we don't we wouldn't even have one if it wasn't for TI and Steve traveling we just	2987	B
you know	2987	B
no	2987	B
and uh	2987	B
we basically just have the we you know we cut up a lot of cards when we you know like it's just as easy just to use two you know instead of paying so much	2987	B
um i guess my music taste musical tastes uh run pretty much the gambit i listen to a little bit of everything	2990	A
uh yeah uh i i grew up in east Texas listening to mostly- mostly- mostly country type music country and western type stuff	2990	A
uh and of course uh grew up also with rock and roll so i'm that's pretty much ingrained	2990	A
uh right now most of my musical uh experiences- experiences are with radio	2990	A
we listen to one of the local uh you- what's usually the number one local rock type station uh adult contemporary soft rock Ron Chapman right	2990	A
and uh so we we listen to that uh pretty much all the time	2990	A
um-hum hum	2990	A
right	2990	A
right	2990	A
yeah	2990	A
well it's i i was just thinking uh you know we we say or KVIL says i think- i think they call theirs uh adult contemporary	2990	A
uh which means soft rock or early- early type rock music and and that's really what i what i consider rock and roll	2990	A
it's uh not rock	2990	A
right	2990	A
um-hum well it's that's funny because i even when i first heard the Beatles i couldn't stand them you know it took it took a a while before i really liked the Beatles	2990	A
well i doubt that	2990	A
yeah i i might have been too old for the Beatles that might have been what it was i was past that point when they came along uh but uh i i grew up uh listening to Elvis you know before- even before the Beatles so	2990	A
right yeah but uh	2990	A
but uh	2990	A
yeah but uh my uh like i said my my tastes run- run the range we listen to uh you know even listen to a little bit of classical type stuff my my wife uh plays the piano	2990	A
and she plays a little bit of that and so we you know we listen to that she plays you know whatever what she can what she wants to	2990	A
um yeah but uh i guess musicians or singers in particular uh uh Willie Nelson's one of my favorites you know so uh it uh	2990	A
in the in the country and western rein uh vein i really i'm enjoying quite a bit of the country music now	2990	A
yeah	2990	A
um-hum	2990	A
yeah	2990	A
yeah	2990	A
uh-huh	2990	A
yeah	2990	A
um-hum	2990	A
yes i uh	2990	A
right	2990	A
um-hum	2990	A
yeah	2990	A
um-hum	2990	A
right let's see the the Grammy yeah	2990	A
uh-huh	2990	A
well our our daughter uh listens to uh quite a bit to one of those uh i don't know which station it is she listens to	2990	A
our son- our son is into heavy metal and our daughter's into the the the Christian type music	2990	A
uh matter of face she went to a went to the concert down at uh Reunion last week uh	2990	A
Sandy Patty right	2990	A
yeah	2990	A
um-hum	2990	A
right yeah	2990	A
yeah	2990	A
yeah	2990	A
oh yeah well that's our daughter's an adult so but uh so she's	2990	A
yeah	2990	A
yeah- oh yeah i love- i love his uh	2990	A
yeah	2990	A
um-hum	2990	A
yeah	2990	A
uh that's uh our son goes you know goes off into his room and and turns his on he he's not around much either- either very- very much but	2990	A
but uh you know it's i'm not uh i don't uh don't find too much of the heavy metal stuff that i want to listen to	2990	A
um-hum	2990	A
let's see	2990	A
yeah that's yeah so instead- so instead you buy Sandy Patty and Amy Grant and	2990	A
right that yeah that	2990	A
uh i was trying to think there's some uh we go to the First Baptist Church over here in Richardson	2990	A
and uh there some some of the musicians some of the young people from there that have become	2990	A
semi pro i guess musicians our daughter's gone uh gone on a couple of choir tour things with the with the young peoples' choir	2990	A
and uh you know she she really gets into into that singing with that group you know and	2990	A
uh-huh	2990	A
now that's	2990	A
you don't have music in the Church of Christ	2990	A
oh yeah	2990	A
yeah well i guess uh you know there- there- there are are ways to express your feelings and your beliefs and uh music is one of the ways of expression and you know it's not uh	2990	A
um-hum	2990	A
right	2990	A
yeah	2990	A
right	2990	A
oh well that's good	2990	B
uh-huh	2990	B
yeah	2990	B
yeah	2990	B
um-hum	2990	B
hum	2990	B
yeah	2990	B
oh yeah yeah is that KVIL or yeah	2990	B
huh well i grew up around here i grew up in Fort Worth	2990	B
and uh it's funny because_1 KVIL back when i was a teenager was an AM station i think yeah and uh it used to have like the top twenty top forty all the time you know	2990	B
and i of course i was listening to rock music what- what i called rock music when i was a teenager now the music is so different than what i used to listen to that i don't know if i could- could consider it the same but	2990	B
yeah yeah	2990	B
right	2990	B
right	2990	B
yeah	2990	B
yeah well	2990	B
my husband and i are both that way we we both really like the Beatles a lot and um	2990	B
oh really	2990	B
that's funny well i'm probably older than you then but but i uh i always thought the Beatles were great and	2990	B
oh	2990	B
oh	2990	B
yeah	2990	B
yeah see i liked Elvis a lot and he was like my hero and now my little girl thinks it's real funny because_1 uh she'll see him she'll go ooh you mean you really thought he was neat	2990	B
um	2990	B
yeah	2990	B
yeah	2990	B
well that's good	2990	B
yeah i like Willie Nelson too	2990	B
yeah well see i the the reason i said my taste is probably different is i have always liked country music and my husband has always been just total rock	2990	B
and so uh we never could agree on what we were going to listen to after we got married because_1 i'd want to listen- hear country and he'd want to hear rock and we couldn't get along because_1 his rock was too rock for me i like soft rock but i don't like some of the heavy metal stuff he was listening to	2990	B
and um	2990	B
so both of us were real strong members of a church and uh we decided we start listening to contemporary Christian music so we started listening to one of the stations around here that we both really like it plays just Christian music all the time	2990	B
and we've gotten now where that's pretty much all we listen to and uh there're some really really talented artists that's you know song writers and singers that uh do just Christian music	2990	B
so of course you know Amy Grant and people like that are pretty well known there's a guy named Bruce Carroll and he's my favorite because_1 he has a country sound but it's Christian lyrics	2990	B
and he's a wonderful song writer he won a an an is it Emmy or what does it Grammy it's the Grammy awards they give for music yeah he won a Grammy for inspirational song of the year last year so	2990	B
yeah	2990	B
uh-huh	2990	B
yeah well that's neat	2990	B
oh Sandy Patty and yeah well that's pretty neat well see i'm excited that kids these days are liking decent music and uh	2990	B
i mean all the songs of of course on on this station have real good good lyrics and good ideas and that kind of thing so i really encourage my daughter to listen to that and she right now she loves it i don't know	2990	B
if it'll stick with her she's still young in elementary school so	2990	B
yeah well that's that's good that she still chooses that but you know i like the country sound there are several- i like- i like Willie Nelson i always like Don Williams my dad thought i was crazy but	2990	B
he's always been one of my favorites and um then my husband on the other hand he i guess when he was like in his early twenties really got into the heavy metal kind of stuff before we got married and	2990	B
so then he'd want to play that stuff and i was like oh that's giving me a headache	2990	B
yeah	2990	B
yeah	2990	B
yeah	2990	B
that's right-	2990	B
yeah	2990	B
yeah yeah well i still whenever they um have these advertisements on TV for um records that have like all the songs from the seventies i was i was in high school like from the early seventies and uh	2990	B
so all that music brings back a lot of memories you know and i'm always thinking oh i'd like to have one of those albums but since we made this agreement that we're going to listen to Christian music i think oh well i'll probably set it on the shelf and would never you know play it	2990	B
yeah that's right we buy things that we know the whole family can listen to	2990	B
uh-huh	2990	B
oh that's neat	2990	B
uh-huh	2990	B
oh that's good yeah	2990	B
yeah well see i'm an interesting person because i go to the Church of Christ and there's a lot of people at Church of Christ that think uh	2990	B
that's right and and i think my personal opinion is they're missing out on a lot and i love um this you know that KLTY that's what i listen to all the time and i	2990	B
i love all the music that they play on there but i have a lot of people that go to church with me that kind of criticize that and think that uh it's wrong and all this so uh it-	2990	B
yeah	2990	B
yeah yeah	2990	B
well i told my husband the one thing i like about it is uh you know you kind of think about whatever you listen to i mean you just you may not realize you're doing it but you do and uh when i listen to Christian music then i'm listening- i'm thinking about something good you know and	2990	B
i'll be washing dishes or something and i'll think about a song and it'll bring back you know some ideas and so to me it's just a good influence but there's still a whole lot of other music i you know really enjoy listening to my husband and i both kind of really got into REO Speedwagon-	2990	B
you want to go first	2929	A
yeah like the government- if should the government make it universal or something like that	2929	A
uh-huh you you would be in favor of it	2929	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2929	A
uh-huh	2929	A
do they have options on who they	2929	A
uh you know like choices of doctors and that type of thing	2929	A
do you	2929	A
uh-huh	2929	A
uh-huh that's the way with me i don't know a whole lot about it i would- that's the only concern i would have because i think personalities	2929	A
plus the type of doctor it is has a lot to do with the care	2929	A
and if you didn't have any choice	2929	A
on you know on who you go to	2929	A
uh-huh	2929	A
uh-huh	2929	A
uh-huh	2929	A
or to change even like if you didn't approve or didn't think you were getting good service	2929	A
uh-huh	2929	A
uh-huh	2929	A
uh-huh that- that's one of my main concerns i i have a friend that has	2929	A
their boy has been sick for several months and they just have found out what's the trouble and they have gone through	2929	A
uh one two three four five doctors and then a team of doctors	2929	A
and they finally determined what the problem was it took that long	2929	A
and that that something like that you know i thought if you couldn't change or	2929	A
look elsewhere	2929	A
you know for help	2929	A
if you want- i don't know how that program works you know if you can do that	2929	A
uh-huh	2929	A
uh-huh	2929	A
uh-huh	2929	A
um-hum	2929	A
i guess that's that's primarily was one of my thoughts you know because you know how government is	2929	A
uh-huh	2929	A
for them to have a choice on	2929	A
if they're in favor of it or not	2929	A
it it would	2929	A
um-hum	2929	A
uh-huh	2929	A
uh-huh	2929	A
uh-huh	2929	A
huh	2929	A
uh-huh	2929	A
uh	2929	A
uh-huh	2929	A
uh-huh i know where my son works they have uh an option	2929	A
right now where they can have their own physician or they can choose one that their company	2929	A
has elected	2929	A
and that costs them less	2929	A
if they take the doctor that the	2929	A
that the company has selected	2929	A
he get	2929	A
well only to the point that he could go to somebody at his own expense	2929	A
otherwise he would- you know he has to take the physician that uh and the hospital that the company has chosen as their	2929	A
you know the one they have taken	2929	A
and their again i mean he's gotten good service he took the less expensive one of course	2929	A
uh-huh	2929	A
uh	2929	A
right right yeah	2929	A
uh because_1 that's the first i've really	2929	A
known anybody that you know works for somebody that they had that option	2929	A
you know to make the choice of what kind of insurance policy they what kind of hospitalization they wanted to take	2929	A
uh-huh	2929	A
oh if you have your health you're wealthy you really are yeah	2929	A
uh we live in a rural area up here	2929	A
uh are you familiar with any of the area at all	2929	A
where	2929	A
oh well that's that's a ways away but we live in Clarion County	2929	A
uh we have a cousin that lives in Philadelphia	2929	A
and uh	2929	A
yes uh-huh	2929	A
oh uh-huh that's a nice state	2929	A
so i suppose really our situation here is even different that it is in you know like more populated areas	2929	A
as far as uh	2929	A
the doctors that are available	2929	A
course we have good physicians here too we've been pretty fortunate	2929	A
we've had some of the most outstanding doctors in our area	2929	A
for some of the different fields	2929	A
so uh we've been pretty fortunate um-hum	2929	A
oh yeah	2929	A
uh-huh	2929	A
uh-huh	2929	A
oh yeah	2929	A
uh-huh	2929	A
it sure is i still wish they could do more with the cancer situation though	2929	A
they uh they just don't seem to be i know they're making progress but not like	2929	A
that i would like to see yeah yeah	2929	A
uh-huh	2929	A
uh-huh	2929	A
but a majority- a lot of them don't do these things even and it doesn't seem to matter	2929	A
so uh it real	2929	A
uh-huh	2929	A
well they say second hand smoke and that is worse than smoking so so what do you do you know	2929	A
yeah yeah take their rights away from them they say i never had the desire so i haven't ever had that problem	2929	A
as far as that goes so	2929	A
i can't take any credit for not smoking either	2929	A
so	2929	A
it's hard to break it's a hard one to quit	2929	A
yeah	2929	A
yes very nice talking to you too and you have a good day	2929	A
right okay	2929	A
um bye bye	2929	A
well i believe that the um the voice that uh initialized this call asked about uh if we thought that it should be something that	2929	B
should be put into action	2929	B
yes i i i i would be committed to that	2929	B
because	2929	B
oh definitely yes	2929	B
i know that there are many countries that um	2929	B
are very successful with the operation of the government uh providing that plan	2929	B
um i'm not sure what- how their program is run but i know it has been successful	2929	B
and i would really have to uh read the history of	2929	B
probably i uh the country that has faired very well with it i'd like to see the uh	2929	B
the data on that	2929	B
well i	2929	B
yes i think that's primary is if you have a good relationship	2929	B
with your doctor that you can feel free to discuss	2929	B
anything with him	2929	B
and uh	2929	B
oh absolutely that the choice would be yours yes if you felt that you weren't being	2929	B
um given the proper guidelines for your health	2929	B
that you should be able to make um a choice there	2929	B
yes and the expense of that yes	2929	B
well i would i would think that they would have that as part part of the benefit	2929	B
to the health care program that you would indeed have a choice	2929	B
that you could select that individual yourself	2929	B
and i'm sure that they would have a history of each doctor	2929	B
and hopefully that they would have their um	2929	B
accreditations there too	2929	B
yes um	2929	B
but those guidelines have to be set up and i think they should be voted on by the public	2929	B
and uh	2929	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2929	B
right yes	2929	B
and of course they would give a full plan of what their intentions would be and	2929	B
um	2929	B
i think that's	2929	B
primary uh for the health if they were going to have a universal health care plan	2929	B
that uh they would have all the facts and the figures and uh	2929	B
what it would mean to each individual family or and an an individual	2929	B
perhaps being single	2929	B
um i'm not sure what else that uh	2929	B
we could address uh on health care	2929	B
um	2929	B
other than the fact i think um	2929	B
the eyes and the ears and the uh whole self should be uh	2929	B
uh included in all of that uh dental eye care and uh our body as a whole should be included in that because	2929	B
there's so many avenues that needs to be um	2929	B
undertaken in a program like that	2929	B
um	2929	B
i wouldn't want to have to go for a private doctor for	2929	B
anything and not be covered by the program	2929	B
uh-huh	2929	B
and does he have an option uh if he doesn't care for the personality	2929	B
oh i see	2929	B
um	2929	B
well if he's pleased with it i guess that's uh the bottom line	2929	B
so but i i would be afraid of what would happen if you had a personality conflict or something	2929	B
yeah cause there's always that opposite story there	2929	B
uh-huh	2929	B
it's quite different from when i was uh	2929	B
under doctor's care that's for sure	2929	B
i'm i'm very thankful that i'm not under any doctor's care	2929	B
that's right	2929	B
yes	2929	B
uh-huh what part of uh Pennsylvania do you live in	2929	B
well i have a brother that lives there	2929	B
uh near uh Philadelphia	2929	B
okay	2929	B
are you a native Pennsylvanian	2929	B
okay so	2929	B
i'm a former Michiganian so	2929	B
yes it is it's very lovely it's a very lovely state	2929	B
uh-huh uh-huh i'm sure it is uh-huh	2929	B
uh-huh	2929	B
that has broadened so much also	2929	B
that is the fields that you know are opening up are	2929	B
um just phenomenal they	2929	B
i mean look at the AIDS uh case you know i mean they	2929	B
that's a whole new	2929	B
field in itself it's just uh	2929	B
it's an auto immune deficiency but it sure is a dilly one	2929	B
yes i do too	2929	B
to eradicate it entirely yeah	2929	B
well there's guidelines that people have to follow and if they're determined to uh have their cigarettes and the other uh	2929	B
carcinogenic causing items then	2929	B
how do you teach them i guess you would-	2929	B
that's true too it's i i i really believe our environment have a lot to do with it	2929	B
yeah	2929	B
well you just have to ban the smoking to their to their little room that they want to	2929	B
um-hum um-hum	2929	B
well it's a bad habit that's	2929	B
that	2929	B
yes it they say that it is	2929	B
well it was nice talking with you	2929	B
and	2929	B
well you do the same and uh we'll be talking- i guess talking around the country	2929	B
okay you bye-bye	2929	B
well i always think i'm paying too much taxes how about you	2996	B
although at least Texas doesn't have a state income tax yet i mean you know they keep threatening us that maybe there'll be a day that they're going to uh enact this i think uh	2996	B
the um other means of providing income for the state have been dwindling so they keep trying to say we may need a uh state income tax	2996	B
uh-huh	2996	B
yeah makes quite a bit of difference in your uh well your income level you know because_1 other states take chunk- quite a bit a chunk out for uh city and state taxes so you're uh looking at your yearly salary it makes quite a difference	2996	B
a little more take home here	2996	B
yeah Richardson area	2996	B
yeah i work at uh well mainly the Expressway Site is where i work	2996	B
oh okay	2996	B
yeah	2996	B
or up to Collin County somewhere that you're getting out of the um Dallas County area because_1 what do we pay like eight and a half percent something like that for the uh sales tax	2996	B
which yeah that really is pretty high	2996	B
i think so although i really i don't go up there too much i mean i i normally just kind of go to Richardson Square Mall or Valley View Mall just kind of for the convenience uh	2996	B
i guess maybe if i was going to buy a car or something maybe i would consider where i was buying it to try to you know save a little bit on that sales tax because_1 on a car that really matters- kind of mounts up	2996	B
yeah	2996	B
uh-huh	2996	B
yeah yeah that's true although i wish- i wish you know overall they'd try the lottery again when did you first come to Texas	2996	B
okay- well that's about the same time as me i came down in eighty two	2996	B
um well Ohio kind of my parents live in Ohio i had lived a little while in Michigan but you know basically i went to high school and college in Ohio and lived there uh more years than i ever did in Michigan	2996	B
oh okay but you know when we first came down here i really thought this place was somewhat backward i mean i was just shocked that we couldn't shop on Sunday	2996	B
remember that-	2996	B
uh-huh	2996	B
uh-huh	2996	B
were you shocked like oh no i'm stuck i need to buy stuff	2996	B
uh-huh	2996	B
oh few places now seem to do it by the slice but	2996	B
right	2996	B
well the the uh there was other things too i mean i think it's taken us Yankee's influence down here to get them to uh come to the the the you know the correct decade here and century um	2996	B
i couldn't believe that you could have open containers of beer or alcohol whatever in the car	2996	B
i mean you could always um uh be careful about that back then because uh you know if you- if a cop stopped you then you would um you know get arrested or whatnot and people would just drink openly	2996	B
uh-huh	2996	B
oh well i don't smoke so i don't really know what the taxes are and stuff on it	2996	B
um	2996	B
so you end up about paying about twelve dollars for a pack and two dollars of that is taxes	2996	B
huh	2996	B
gee	2996	B
they're cheaper there	2996	B
oh	2996	B
oh i got you okay	2996	B
uh-huh	2996	B
well how'd you do	2996	B
a dollar oh well but you had fun playing right	2996	B
yeah oh definitely seems like	2996	A
yeah i think that uh we probably will have to have to uh have a state income tax because uh Texans don't approve of such things as lotteries	2996	A
uh uh well i i come- i come here from New York and New York had a state lottery and it really raised a lot of money for the for the state	2996	A
uh although we in New York we had to pay a state and a city uh tax and it was really a great relief when i got to Texas that i didn't have to pay that city income tax though	2996	A
right	2996	A
it sure does make- make a difference	2996	A
uh-huh do you live in Dallas	2996	A
oh you do oh	2996	A
oh i do too	2996	A
okay	2996	A
and then you know too that uh taxes are are less like if you live in Mesquite	2996	A
you know some people will go shopping in Mesquite at the malls out there uh	2996	A
uh-huh	2996	A
eight point five	2996	A
um-hum	2996	A
is it the same- is it uh less in Collin County than it is in Dallas County	2996	A
yeah	2996	A
um-hum	2996	A
um-hum	2996	A
yeah it sure did and then once you could deduct at least some of that um off off your income tax and you can't do that anymore	2996	A
it really hit me yesterday i had uh air conditioning service for my car done and i had a little little uh coupon special that was twenty two dollars for um air conditioning service where they	2996	A
uh checked it and charged- recharged it and put one one pound of freon in and if you needed another pound of freon they gave- it it was like seven dollars and something	2996	A
and then with the with the twenty two dollars and the seven something it all came out to i i ended up paying like thirty four dollars and i couldn't believe it and it- the tax you know really hits you	2996	A
um-hum and then	2996	A
oh it's been i've been here for nine years	2996	A
really where'd you come from	2996	A
oh uh-huh	2996	A
um-hum	2996	A
um-hum	2996	A
well uh i did visit uh Michigan i visited Kalamazoo once my sister used to live there	2996	A
uh-huh	2996	A
that's true i tell you what hit me the first year i was here uh Christmas eve in New York there used to be stores open the department stores wouldn't close uh	2996	A
well i'd say they closed maybe eight or nine o'clock the department stores on Christmas eve but uh there were stores that you could go to uh you know like discount stores and	2996	A
and stores down in the village and just all over the place where you could go to and you could shop till like twelve or one o'clock that night and that was like that was really the only night they were open that late but it was Christmas eve and when i came to Dallas	2996	A
i thought i was going to do that Christmas eve and i couldn't find hardly anything open after five o'clock in the afternoon and i was oh i was i really i really was stuck	2996	A
and i think Target was the one that stayed open later than anybody- anybody else and uh i was able to pick up a few things in there but boy i was- i was really shocked	2996	A
and then another shock i had well when i went to uh to buy a slice of pizza and found out that i had to buy the whole pie	2996	A
yeah now but they but back then they didn't when i first came no	2996	A
anyway	2996	A
yeah	2996	A
right right	2996	A
uh-huh	2996	A
uh-huh	2996	A
yeah and talk a talking about alcohol and beer look at the taxes on that and the taxes on a package of of cigarettes i used to smoke you know and uh	2996	A
that would have been enough to to make me me give them_1 up the price of them_1 now but i gave them_1 up couple- a couple years ago because i had some sinus problems	2996	A
well	2996	A
well they're like two	2996	A
or i i believe they're hitting two dollars a pack now	2996	A
maybe a little bit a little bit a little bit more in some places	2996	A
uh well i believe it's a little more than twelve dollars for a carton i think it's maybe thirteen or something	2996	A
uh because_1 i remember we went to to Oklahoma to this- this bingo place this Choctaw bingo uh a couple weeks ago and somebody that went with me bought a carton	2996	A
for uh uh ten dollars and something and they really thought they were getting a big discount	2996	A
well because it's you know the Indians i don't think they pay tax	2996	A
in in Oklahoma	2996	A
and uh it was a Indian	2996	A
it- well it's a bingo hall for the benefit of the Indians there although i didn't see very many Indian people in there there were just bus loads of people that come from everywhere else to play that bingo because it's it's	2996	A
the stakes are higher and payoffs are bigger and so forth i won a dollar yeah i had fun uh couple people on the bus won some money one- one guy won	2996	A
no	2940	B
if i exercised i'd be too thin	2940	B
uh-huh i just have one of those metabolisms that um	2940	B
doesn't require it really if i if yeah	2940	B
well i think you kind of are born with those type of genes	2940	B
um-hum	2940	B
well i did have a program of walking because i enjoyed doing it in the evening and i had a dog at that time and i walked him	2940	B
and i kind of lost like ten pounds and i said whoa better stop	2940	B
um-hum	2940	B
um-hum	2940	B
well my daughter really uh is into uh fitness uh of course she's in uh the nursing profession and she knows how beneficial it is even though she says mom you	2940	B
you know you really need to exercise because it does a lot for your body other than maintain your wealthy your weight	2940	B
yes and and she has a very strenuous um	2940	B
exercise mode that she keeps herself in plus she has um a family that she takes care of and a forty hour work week so i'm really amazed at her stamina	2940	B
but she um has inherited uh a little problem from her father's side because he did have a weight problem	2940	B
but he maintains his weight now because he jogs like uh nine miles a day	2940	B
yeah and he gets that adrenalin high and i guess that really i've never reached it um	2940	B
um-hum	2940	B
um-hum	2940	B
um-hum	2940	B
well i think the old adage is quite true in this case with exercise that moderation is the key	2940	B
if you know your limits and you stay within those limits i think that you and you're happy with the exercise that you do because i think it's um very imperative that you have a happy	2940	B
um attitude about exercise otherwise it becomes a chore and a task and and you you think of it as work and um	2940	B
it doesn't	2940	B
really uh do a lot for you but if you think of it as a uh	2940	B
a source of uh well being and health and uh uh have a positive attitude i think you you go a long way with that	2940	B
um-hum	2940	B
um-hum um	2940	B
yes	2940	B
you're just uh focused then on on maintaining your health because if you do the exercise naturally you're going to feel a lot healthier	2940	B
oh that's good	2940	B
that's very good	2940	B
um-hum	2940	B
well that's marvelous	2940	B
um-hum	2940	B
wow	2940	B
um-hum	2940	B
um-hum	2940	B
well i think the way you're talking now that you're already motivated for that goal	2940	B
oh sure	2940	B
okay	2940	B
i think it does a lot for your mental um exercise too uh keeping um a clear mind i think your mind is clearer when you exercise	2940	B
um-hum um-hum	2940	B
yeah and you'd have- yeah	2940	B
you've	2940	B
you've beat your head- yourself over the head long enough	2940	B
yeah sure	2940	B
yeah and it has an effect on your family life too	2940	B
um-hum	2940	B
uh-huh not show	2940	B
um-hum	2940	B
um-hum	2940	B
um-hum	2940	B
um-hum	2940	B
well uh one of uh eating is one of the joys of life you know and uh	2940	B
yeah well it is for a lot of people and uh you you surely should get satisfaction out of eating you know because you socialize and you're maintaining your your body uh you're you're maintaining all of your	2940	B
uh faculties that run the body your brain and your flesh and your bones and all of that and eating is a pleasure	2940	B
that is one of the basic uh motivators in life is eating	2940	B
um-hum	2940	B
um-hum hm	2940	B
sure and they've got these	2940	B
marvelous health clubs too that you know you can use their facilities	2940	B
um-hum um-hum	2940	B
oh yes uh-huh um-hum	2940	B
oh sure- certainly	2940	B
well that's fine i think we covered quite a bit	2940	B
it was nice talking with you	2940	B
take care bye-bye	2940	B
okay	2940	A
are you currently active in any type of exercise program	2940	A
you're not	2940	A
is that right	2940	A
doesn't require exercise	2940	A
i- i wish i had such luck	2940	A
my wife is that way i uh	2940	A
course i've always uh i've always been in fairly good condition but and i do exercise uh lately i've been off of it because i've had shoulder problems but uh	2940	A
that seems to be on the mend and i think i'm pretty close to getting back on a program again	2940	A
i do notice as i get older i- i tend to i you know i don't exercise like i like i used to	2940	A
and it's much much harder for me to control you know the few pounds here and there	2940	A
so whenever i do have to lose five or ten pounds whatever it's a major effort	2940	A
whereas i could used to just lay off two or three meals uh	2940	A
you know for a day or so and then you know i could lose you know five pounds	2940	A
now i'd have to do that for two solid weeks before i'd lose five pounds so	2940	A
um i think it's important when they when they talk about you know getting your heart rate up and	2940	A
nine	2940	A
i used to run uh you know quite heavy i used to i used to run like three and maybe four miles	2940	A
three or four times a week	2940	A
but uh over the years of the pounding and everything else my knees just don't support it any more	2940	A
so i've i do walk and i do ride my bike and we do have a workout facility here at work and i do i used to be on a fairly rigorous uh weight lifting program and and uh riding the bike- the stationary bike	2940	A
uh but uh then i started i think it was just from	2940	A
trying to lift too much	2940	A
i started getting the shoulder problems and uh so i've been off now for about four months	2940	A
that's right	2940	A
the one thing's i mean i enjoy doing it i- i enjoy any kind of any- any kind of outdoor uh activity exercise whatever and in fact i used- i do it during lunch i- i really look forward to it	2940	A
uh i did overdo it and i know it and i keep trying to tell myself that i'm not twenty years old any more i can't i just can't keep up and uh	2940	A
and i've got to learn just you know when i get to a certain point i use- use it to maintain i'm not i'm not after	2940	A
uh you know the uh the twenty year old body any more i'm not uh	2940	A
i'm just not geared that way	2940	A
yeah on just staying in condition and uh	2940	A
but i had my uh cholesterol was down to	2940	A
uh and it was	2940	A
i think around a hundred and twenty two	2940	A
yeah very good my my blood pressure was real good	2940	A
and uh my uh percent body fat was less than eighteen percent	2940	A
so i mean overall i was in very good shape now after four months of being off exercise i've put on probably fifteen pounds	2940	A
and taking on you know taking on quite some bad habits of snacking and everything else so i know i mean i've got a major event	2940	A
uh once i get back i think probably within a couple of weeks i'll be able to get back to it again	2940	A
i know it's got to happen uh i'm i'm slowly growing out of my wardrobe so i have no choice i can't afford a new one so	2940	A
but uh	2940	A
but it's	2940	A
it's something i've done pretty much all my life i uh i played college ball and and and i've i've always liked	2940	A
staying in shape and it just really bothers me when i'm not	2940	A
so uh	2940	A
and- and- and plus it's just important	2940	A
well i sleep better at night i think clearly you know i'm	2940	A
doing something	2940	A
uh	2940	A
i just	2940	A
i have real poor self-esteem if i know that i haven't done something	2940	A
i just feel lazy and i feel like i've cheated myself	2940	A
and- and i've gone through four months of that and i'm kind of like you know it's time to get back on	2940	A
yeah i- i hate it i really do i hate it	2940	A
that too and like i said my wife is one of those you know she could sit down and eat a whole chocolate cake	2940	A
and and never never show a an ounce of it	2940	A
and uh she's got one of those fast metabolisms my daughter does too	2940	A
and i see them eat	2940	A
and then i'm of course i'm impelled also	2940	A
and uh	2940	A
that just that that seems to be the worst- the worst thing i have a problem with is i tend to like food way too much	2940	A
and uh back when back when i was working out when i got home i didn't tend to want to eat this much i was i came home i felt satisfied i'd get out and work a little bit in the yard i'd come in i'm hot	2940	A
and i'm a little bit tired and i'd just and i'd just grab a a salad or a snack or something like that and then	2940	A
that would be the end of it	2940	A
it is for me	2940	A
yep that's for sure	2940	A
but uh	2940	A
i've got to get on the wagon and i know it but i like i said- i mean because_1 i-	2940	A
i have probably three people in my neighborhood who enjoy running and walking and riding the bikes and stuff like that so i mean there's there's plenty of opportunities	2940	A
i just have to do it	2940	A
yeah we in fact we've got several of them_1 uh you know within just a couple of miles	2940	A
in fact uh you know TI has a real good one right there in in uh Lewisville	2940	A
not too far from where i live so that that	2940	A
that's something i can use	2940	A
so well	2940	A
i guess that's about all i can say about exercising	2940	A
well it was a joy	2940	A
same here take care bye-bye	2940	A
well we've tried having let me turn the TV off we've tried having uh	2935	B
and we have tried several years in a row and we've given up between the fire ants the pill bugs the weeds the drought and a hundred and ten degree heat all Summer and we just kind of uh	2935	B
we had to put so much poison out on everything that we thought who'd want to eat that stuff	2935	B
you know so we have really been frustrated by our gardening attempts here and uh if you really water a lot you can do it but you know when you have to pay for water it really gets to be an annoyance to have to water constantly	2935	B
but that's nice to have but yeah yeah so what do you do up there	2935	B
um	2935	B
oh wow	2935	B
yeah	2935	B
really gosh	2935	B
oh boy	2935	B
that sounds wonderful	2935	B
if you don't have a frost you'll be all right	2935	B
wow uh-huh	2935	B
oh boy that's frustrating	2935	B
oh yeah my husband does that thank goodness because i that's not a pleasure for me	2935	B
i love gardens that are well tended and i just there's been a few different places i've lived where i've just	2935	B
there i don't know whether it's little old ladies living there or what but you could just tell that they had a love uh a love affair with their gardens with beautiful wild flowers and just i love the host of colors that just keep coming all you know year long	2935	B
and uh i- i was in England once and that's one thing that impressed me so much is no matter what size yard somebody had they had a beautiful garden in it you know it could be three feet by four feet or something	2935	B
that- yeah that's really lovely i would love to have different fruit trees	2935	B
um we've tried them_1 but again it's just like the sun scorch we've tried them in kind of halfway in the shade and halfway in the sun- i mean it's just	2935	B
see you really really have to be prepared to water constantly during the Summer people that have been successful out here have done this drip irrigation	2935	B
and installed that and um that's really what makes the most sense because_1 you don't have to use so much water and	2935	B
it really does the job but it's just amazing how hot and dry and for how long it gets out here and	2935	B
it's just too distracting right now with these little ones in our lives so maybe when i get older i'll find uh some joy in that	2935	B
yeah	2935	B
yeah it just gets so hot so fast here we don't have really a Spring or a Fall and it just um	2935	B
immediately heats up so that's one thing i miss about living up north as i remember	2935	B
um you know the long Springs and long Falls and the cooler weather you know it was really nice	2935	B
we always had gardens when i was uh living in Chicago in fact my mother once tore up our entire back yard	2935	B
oh but she used to love to do stuff like that	2935	B
yeah it really was i enjoyed it there	2935	B
but maybe when the boys get a little older we'll do some more planting because_1 they like to see things grow they've done a couple of little seed projects and	2935	B
so i think it will be fun for them	2935	B
yeah yeah	2935	B
yeah well it's very therapeutic i think really to get out there and dig in the dirt you know	2935	B
we use to didn't eat them_1 i mean i guess i could be thankful for that	2935	B
oh well good luck to you nice talking to you	2935	B
okay bye-bye	2935	B
well what kind of garden do you have	2935	A
oh	2935	A
um-hum um-hum	2935	A
um-hum do you have a lawn	2935	A
oh yeah	2935	A
well um actually it we've sort of had an ideal Spring	2935	A
and um the the peonies have been out for now about three weeks and the roses have been blooming for two weeks and the grass is uh this lush green and of course i've got lots of weeds in mine because_1 i don't use any poison either	2935	A
but um you know i just keep looking at and i say jeez you know this is the first year it's been so perfect	2935	A
but and my garden you know my tomatoes are two and a half feet tall	2935	A
the plants and	2935	A
you know i'm going- i'm going gee this can't you know we'll have a freeze	2935	A
well that's it last year i think it was you know my peonies were were budding in January and you know there was no way that was going to make it and sure enough you know we did- had really mild weather until	2935	A
i think it was May or something and then you know everything just got hit hard	2935	A
so but yeah it it's interesting and i enjoy gardening my son does the mowing of the grass	2935	A
i don't think that's a pleasure for anybody the mowing- the mowing	2935	A
um-hum	2935	A
oh they help you	2935	A
oh dear	2935	A
oh but that's nice you know i mean the peach tree is is a start and	2935	A
right what about tomatoes aren't they pretty hardy	2935	A
oh	2935	A
um-hum	2935	A
oh	2935	A
um-hum	2935	A
uh-huh	2935	A
of bad weather	2935	A
um-hum	2935	A
um-hum	2935	A
oh dear	2935	A
sounds like it would have been pretty	2935	A
oh sure	2935	A
sure	2935	A
well it sounds like you you've got your hands full	2935	A
and you know gardening isn't isn't high on the list but it's not off the list	2935	A
um-hum	2935	A
oh	2935	A
right maybe next year they'll do better	2935	A
oh dear	2935	A
okay well thanks it was nice talking to you too bye-bye	2935	A
okay so my children are twenty and twenty four and uh	2931	B
my son just moved	2931	B
uh to Arkansas so he's married so course uh uh when when they're here when they lived here and i have a daughter whose twenty and we spend a lot of time together	2931	B
not so much as you know we're we both have everybody's busy but when my kids were younger	2931	B
i was a single parent and i spent most of my life with my children i did a did a lot things with the kids	2931	B
but uh yeah it's uh a i don't i i	2931	B
i one thing that happened is when when my son uh graduated from high school and he went off to college	2931	B
then it it drastically changed uh before- prior to that we had sit down dinners and we talked and we did a whole lot of things and then when he left	2931	B
uh my daughter and i just kind of said well let's just kind of do what do our own thing and uh	2931	B
you know i i think that might i don't know i don't know you know it's been so long since i had little children at home i'll i'll leave it up to you as to what's really going on these days	2931	B
yeah	2931	B
uh-huh	2931	B
right	2931	B
oh so you're not working now great	2931	B
hum	2931	B
yeah	2931	B
right but you know if uh uh i know now that i can look back and and i think about how much	2931	B
how much time i devoted to my children and and	2931	B
not necessarily but sacrificed a social life because i really did devote myself to my children basically i mean	2931	B
i mean i was i mean i did some things but i mean i really did but i have no regrets about that and i you know um	2931	B
and i can look back and it was so much fun being a kid with them and getting to do all the fun things that	2931	B
you know you get to do it that kids get to do and and that you wouldn't do by do you know with other adults	2931	B
so it's great fun i really envy you	2931	B
this is a wonderful time of your life	2931	B
um-hum	2931	B
well i can remember my my mom started working	2931	B
my parents well course both of them worked but my mom started working when i i was third	2931	B
the last- the youngest and she started working when i went to first grade and i can remember	2931	B
just a couple of few times that she would stay home and i i don't know if she was sick or just wanted to take the day off or what but	2931	B
come home from school and you know every- like you'd tell that she'd just mopped and she had you know food was cooking and the house smelled so good	2931	B
uh i tell you what i'd take- i don't know if children who maybe children who have that everyday don't don't don't appreciate it as much as you know	2931	B
but uh it really was really was a special and i wished that she could have been home more it would have been greater because she was	2931	B
because she worked she was always kind of high strung and you know	2931	B
didn't have the time to spend with us individually so	2931	B
i think it's great if if uh if if you enjoy staying home with your kids while they're young and and can do it	2931	B
that's great i wish i could stay home now	2931	B
that's right	2931	B
well and and uh so you probably have a lot of friends who have small children do you do you find the the trend is uh	2931	B
away from what you're doing or that they're not spending that much time with them put them off with	2931	B
sitters and how about	2931	B
right	2931	B
right	2931	B
yeah	2931	B
well that's great	2931	B
well	2931	B
well i meant you know i meant	2931	B
if you don't ever have to go to work and you and you're you're happy you know even if your	2931	B
uh kids all the way through high school and then it doesn't mean you have to go back to work	2931	B
so	2931	B
okay the hours are at least to be home you know	2931	B
that way uh maybe then then you can find out if you're really happy doing that if you want to do it full time later on	2931	B
so that's good	2931	B
well maybe now that you've had your own children you'll like to be around little children or have a little- little better tolerance	2931	B
that'd be tough yeah	2931	B
nice talking to you and maybe i'll talk to you again okay bye-bye	2931	B
oh	2931	A
uh-huh	2931	A
uh-huh	2931	A
oh	2931	A
yeah	2931	A
uh-huh	2931	A
uh-huh	2931	A
that's is a tremendous burden to be working and have two kids to take care of	2931	A
and i don't know how you did it but um i have a six year old that's well she's in first grade and then i have a three and a half year old and um	2931	A
i have always been a big advocate of spending tons of time with my kids	2931	A
and um when i my first one when she was born i had to work part-time for a while because we had to have the extra money	2931	A
but when the second one came along i was fortunate enough that i i quit and i've been able to stay home and um	2931	A
no no i don't work yeah and so i'm one of those few old-fashioned moms and we	2931	A
uh i spend the whole day with Tara and we go and do things and we read books and we play and you know it's just it's great and i did the same thing with Taylor	2931	A
uh who's my first grader she's also a girl and uh i think- i think i can tell a real difference um Taylor has excelled in school like i just	2931	A
i never imagined she would she's at the top of her class in everything even though she's almost two year younger than almost all the kids in her class	2931	A
and i really feel like that um time i spent with her i mean she probably already had a lot uh	2931	A
of it in her but you know we spent a whole lot of time together reading books and doing a lot of things i think it helped her to feel real good about herself and	2931	A
feel like she could she could do it you know	2931	A
so it's it's been real rewarding for me anyway	2931	A
oh i'm sure	2931	A
uh-huh	2931	A
yeah	2931	A
uh-huh	2931	A
uh-huh	2931	A
uh-huh	2931	A
right	2931	A
yeah	2931	A
yeah	2931	A
well it is you know as a matter of fact i think i'm real bad about looking ahead and thinking oh i don't ever want them to grow up and you know go away to college and all that kind of thing	2931	A
but at least i'm really making the most of the time while they're little and um everything Taylor even attempts to do you know we go and watch her and	2931	A
and support her and that was something my parents weren't able to do and i resented that because i would be in i was always in plays in high school and in all kinds of drama and they could never come and watch me and that just	2931	A
it was so hard for me so i made a vow that when i had kids no matter what they did i was going to be there you know	2931	A
and see them do it so it and like you said it's fun i really enjoy it	2931	A
uh-huh	2931	A
uh-huh	2931	A
uh-huh	2931	A
uh-huh	2931	A
uh-huh	2931	A
uh-huh	2931	A
uh-huh	2931	A
yeah	2931	A
yeah	2931	A
uh-huh	2931	A
right yeah	2931	A
yeah yeah	2931	A
but i just to me that's not important because i feel like we'll have plenty of time to get us a nice house some day and i won't have these you know these little kids all my life so	2931	A
um i just i have been willing to make the sacrifices and my husband has too and so it's not been a problem for us	2931	A
right	2931	A
well it's interesting we're real involved with a church group and so most of our friends are uh church friends	2931	A
and they're the majority of them do stay home uh almost all of my friends i can call any time of day and they're home	2931	A
but um the friends- the friends that i've kept in contact with from you know when i did work and they're still working moms you know uh that	2931	A
i feel like i real big uh difference in opinion with some of them because some of them work just because they enjoy working you know they they don't really have to work they just want to they like to get out and	2931	A
they don't want to be with their kids all day and and that's hard for me because to me they're giving up something so precious you know and um	2931	A
so any time we talk get on that topic i have to be real careful because i'm afraid i'll say something to offend them	2931	A
but um most of my friends do stay home so that it's kind of nice we we have a big support group around here	2931	A
yeah it is i don't know how long everybody will be able to afford to keep doing it but if	2931	A
i guess you just get used to you know living however you have to live to	2931	A
yeah	2931	A
right yeah	2931	A
yeah well i intend to uh i think when they're both in school i may i have a degree to teach and um i've never used it because i was pregnant when i graduated from college and i've always had you know been home with kids or worked part-time	2931	A
but um i might go into like substitute teaching or something because	2931	A
yeah yeah and i can choose they say as a substitute you can tell them the days that you're interested and you know the days you're not you don't have to so	2931	A
right yeah because i have a feeling i'm not going to like it when i did my uh student teaching i oh i hated it	2931	A
i said i don't know why i majored in uh elementary education and here i'm about to graduate and i don't even like this	2931	A
yeah	2931	A
yeah	2931	A
yeah it'll probably make a whole difference and plus i didn't feel well at the time i was pregnant and i was real sick and	2931	A
yeah i and you just don't feel like being around all these little kids when you are just sick to your stomach	2931	A
but anyway it's been nice talking to you	2931	A
and uh thanks for calling bye bye	2931	A
what do you think about gun control	2964	A
uh-huh	2964	A
yeah	2964	A
um-hum	2964	A
yeah and i- i think i think that is right uh	2964	A
the only thing i object to is like uh machine guns and	2964	A
yeah	2964	A
do you think um	2964	A
like Reagan of course before that you know he was in westerns all that- all that time and and uh he was real gung ho And then then just now	2964	A
just this last year it seems like he's he was uh and he was not that bill does not restrict anything outside of just having to wait seven days but	2964	A
it is interesting that he turned around for some reason	2964	A
um-hum	2964	A
um-hum	2964	A
i think and i think a lot of times you know that uh criminals do not go out and buy a	2964	A
what uh uh a good gun costs like two hundred to five hundred dollars	2964	A
you know a handgun they go out and buy the cheapest thing they can	2964	A
and and then they go rob a liquor store or something	2964	A
yeah that is true	2964	A
right	2964	A
um-hum	2964	A
um-hum	2964	A
that is right	2964	A
and a lot of times like um	2964	A
what is his name i can't remember his name right the guy in the Austin tower uh Whitman	2964	A
you know he was sane and and i guess they could have said like Lee Harvey Oswald- Oswald was sane when he bought his gun you know but he bought his by mail anyway	2964	A
but later on you know something can happen they can they can have a brain tumor or they can break down one way or another	2964	A
right	2964	A
um-hum	2964	A
right	2964	A
yeah he might have	2964	A
um-hum	2964	A
yeah	2964	A
yeah i do not either	2964	A
yeah that is true because you know once once they start clamping down on one thing or being against one group then the	2964	A
it gives them a foothold to to be against somebody else	2964	A
and uh and the hunters you know the hunters uh	2964	A
with what game species there are left well especially i mean using a rifle white tail deers mostly	2964	A
you know that is what people hunt for the most with a rifle	2964	A
uh you know they have every right to have a	2964	A
a rifle and be able to to hunt	2964	A
um-hum	2964	A
and that um i think it was a rifle that that kid shot that burglar with in Arlington or wherever it was	2964	A
yes i think it's two years ago or so now	2964	A
you know	2964	A
um-hum	2964	A
yeah i wondered how he managed that	2964	A
um-hum	2964	A
exactly	2964	A
um-hum	2964	A
and and more and more of that kind of thing happens i mean can you imagine i mean it used to be like with the dapper bandit is one guy you know	2964	A
with a gun and a a lot of the stuff that he did they did not publicize	2964	A
because that- it would breach the security of the rest of the banks- the banks	2964	A
one of the things that he did is is um any counter top that was there up to maybe like four feet high he could vertical jump on top of the counter top and and jump down and and be	2964	A
with those people behind the counter before they knew it	2964	A
you know and they they showed us a piece of tape of that one time but it looked like they had cut it up some that was one of the things that was so scary about him	2964	A
and not only did he he um rob banks but he uh	2964	A
at the time when he first started he robbed the Safeway that my brother was working at at the time and that is how he that is how he surprised the cashier	2964	A
he jumped he jumped back there with her and and you know there was nothing she could do by that time	2964	A
yeah	2964	A
um-hum	2964	A
right	2964	A
um-hum	2964	A
um-hum	2964	A
yeah i would	2964	A
yeah and then	2964	A
um-hum	2964	A
yeah right	2964	A
like the the judge what was it two or three months ago the judge in uh Fort Worth i think	2964	A
maybe it was Dallas	2964	A
but he he just convicted uh a man for murder and the guy jumped up and and apparently knew where the judge kept his gun	2964	A
and held it on him for a couple of hours you know and	2964	A
he should he should either have kept it fairly well concealed or kept it a secret	2964	A
well uh	2964	B
i am probably uh closer to being a what is it the ten is on the end of uh no gun control	2964	B
i guess i am probably closer to a ten than a one i believe- i am uh i am not opposed at all to having a waiting period for you know for the purchase of guns	2964	B
uh i think that is appropriate uh a background check on people that uh excuse me especially- especially people that buy handguns	2964	B
uh but i believe that uh you know the Constitution gives uh the individual the right to own	2964	B
firearms for you know for their whatever their own purposes are as long as they are legal purposes	2964	B
and uh i am opposed to anything that would limit what the Constitution allows	2964	B
yeah i- i- i uh i agree with that uh although i can i can see where there might be even be a a potential uh sometime you know a need sometime in the future for the individuals to have	2964	B
uh even machine guns available uh you know if if we were ever invaded of course now that is pretty far fetched but if the United States were ever invaded i think that the	2964	B
man on the street is going have to be the one to defend the country at some point or or might have to at some point	2964	B
and uh i think that there should be uh sufficient- sufficient uh	2964	B
guns and you know and ammunition and things available for that	2964	B
right	2964	B
yeah well i- i always wondered you know why he was so adamant about you know about being opposed to that waiting period	2964	B
uh you know even before i mean you know i- i did not see that the waiting period was a you know it was a major restriction	2964	B
excuse me	2964	B
um-hum	2964	B
right	2964	B
yeah and uh plus you know i guess my opinion is that if uh if a uh	2964	B
criminal or somebody with criminal intent real criminal intent wants a gun they are going to get one	2964	B
uh the drug dealer is not going to you know he's not going to wait the seven days for a gun anyway	2964	B
so it is it is only the actually it is only the the uh	2964	B
the people that are trying to be	2964	B
uh law abiding people are the ones that are going to wind up	2964	B
being able to get the guns legally	2964	B
uh you know after- even with the waiting period and i you know i cannot see that uh that there is anybody that that does not have criminal intent that would have uh any reason to object to that waiting period that is	2964	B
yeah Whitman	2964	B
um-hum	2964	B
right well uh you know Hinckley was the one that took the shot at Reagan and uh he bought his gun at a pawn shop here in Dallas i think or somewhere in the Dallas area	2964	B
and you know if if he'd had to have a waiting period he didn't stay in Dallas long enough	2964	B
uh at that time to have waited the seven days	2964	B
so if if there'd been a waiting period he wouldn't have had the gun	2964	B
uh or a least he wouldn't have had that gun he might've had another one	2964	B
but uh	2964	B
you know so i you know i can see that there are	2964	B
are reasons for having a waiting period that uh i think that anybody that	2964	B
you know anybody that does not have a a criminal background or you know any any real reason to not allow them to have one i think that anybody that wants one should be able to buy one	2964	B
that's interesting because i don't own one though i don't own a gun but that's you know that's my personal opinion anyway	2964	B
right	2964	B
right	2964	B
right you know they rifles and shotguns for you know for like you say for deer hunting and for bird hunting are you know that is	2964	B
kind of the the American way so to speak	2964	B
uh	2964	B
yeah i believe it was yeah	2964	B
uh there was a a uh deal on television just uh i saw it uh yesterday or the day before where there was an an Oriental shopkeeper in California i think it was in San Bernardino California	2964	B
That there were five young guys they were gang members that came in to rob his store	2964	B
and they all had guns and he had a gun somewhere under the counter that he got and he shot all five of those killed two of them_1	2964	B
but you know he he was really blazing away	2964	B
and uh i think he got shot twice himself and uh but he was okay you know it was just he was injured but not seriously apparently	2964	B
but uh you know it was really surprising but it was good you know from my point of view it was good to see him being able to defend him you know his his property and his store	2964	B
and uh you know i- i think that's you know that is the intent of the Constitution is to of that part of the Constitution is to allow people to defend themselves and their property	2964	B
um-hum	2964	B
right	2964	B
um-hum	2964	B
right	2964	B
right	2964	B
um-hum i had i had not heard about him robbing the Safeway	2964	B
but then there is also there is the uh what is his name Bernie Getz	2964	B
the in the New York subway i guess uh well i would have even mixed emotions about him uh somebody carrying a gun you know out into the public on public transportation	2964	B
uh you know of course he was his the purpose of him having the gun was to defend himself because he apparently he had felt threatened you know on the on the subway before	2964	B
but uh i am not sure that uh	2964	B
the private citizen carrying a gun	2964	B
is	2964	B
you know just the routine private citizen carrying a gun	2964	B
is uh necessary to	2964	B
i mean if you are not if you are not uh in a position where you have to defend yourself you know	2964	B
uh in a routine basis then uh	2964	B
perhaps carrying a gun on your person is not uh	2964	B
is not all that advisable	2964	B
uh i know that they are talking about here you know here in Texas about having a new gun law that would allow certain- certain individuals to be licensed to carry a gun	2964	B
and uh	2964	B
i think they ought take a long a good long hard look at at who is allowed to carry a gun in those you know in those situations	2964	B
um-hum	2964	B
right	2964	B
right	2964	B
you know i guess that	2964	B
i do not really know uh i- i guess there is not really a you know a lot to say from my point of view except that	2964	B
you know the the Constitution says what kind of rights we have and i do not i really do not see the the point	2964	B
well the last three days it's been pretty rainy we went to the beach and uh it started uh let's see around four o'clock	2934	A
and uh it had thunder and lightning it was and then you know it was just overcast and rainy for uh the next two- two or three days straight how about_1 yours	2934	A
uh-huh	2934	A
you're from Virginia	2934	A
oh from Texas	2934	A
i heard they had some flooding down there	2934	A
uh-huh	2934	A
hum	2934	A
uh-huh	2934	A
well the last couple of years we're um we're over as far as our rainfall goes before that it was really dry and uh everybody was you know talking about rationing water and doing this and doing that	2934	A
not really rationing water but just cutting down and uh it seems like uh you know the weather pattern is just shifting and uh that uh jet stream is moving uh into our area North Carolina	2934	A
and across but it's uh changing latitude	2934	A
oh yeah	2934	A
uh-huh	2934	A
it's finally cleared up it's just now still- still a little overcast but the sun- but the sun has finally started popping out	2934	A
oh yeah well right now as a matter of fact i'm fixing to go play tennis it's um i'd say it's at least seventy nine eighty well about seventy eight seventy nine degrees	2934	A
um actually the uh the wind normally blows let's see let me think about this south southwest	2934	A
yeah uh but actually- but actually our i guess our weather pattern comes from the uh	2934	A
blows north east yeah you're right it blows north east	2934	A
um-hum	2934	A
uh-huh	2934	A
how far- how far are you from Houston	2934	A
oh i see so you so you don't have- you don't get anything off the Gulf uh immediately from from the ocean	2934	A
uh-huh	2934	A
hm well we've had some you know pretty pretty rough winds oh uh Bangladesh- Bangladesh boy they they caught it bad	2934	A
but we'll probably have our share of the hurricanes i know uh Hurricane Hugo you probably heard about that uh last year	2934	A
yeah and they're still uh rebuilding from that storm	2934	A
so the the beaches here just get really beat up uh	2934	A
and it usually comes this way	2934	A
it comes up from uh Miami uh down around or you know around the Bahamas and it usually travels uh northwest	2934	A
and uh it'll go up the coast quite a ways before it finally hits	2934	A
um let's see two years ago we had one as a matter of fact it went within a mile of my house and uh it was real odd the um barometric pressure drops during a tornado and our uh fire alarm went off	2934	A
so of course that woke everybody up and we knew what was going on to uh you know go downstairs or go into the bedroom- bathroom and uh take cover but uh	2934	A
we get uh yeah we're we're uh we get our share of tornadoes	2934	A
no huh-uh we're about two hours from the beach so uh	2934	A
you know it's uh barometric pressure i believe is higher in the mountains and we catch- we catch some winds you know a few winds coming off of them_1 i think but uh let's see y'all just had a tornado	2934	A
uh over close to Oklahoma and Texas	2934	A
uh-huh	2934	A
oh gosh	2934	A
oh did it	2934	A
hum	2934	A
um boy i would have like to have heard that that could- that would have been something	2934	A
uh-huh	2934	A
uh-huh i used to live in Amarillo originally so i'm	2934	A
oh yeah we used to sit out uh especially in Borger we use to sit out on our back uh picnic table	2934	A
and watch them_1 come out of the sky through the funnel clouds and the only time we got worried is if it hit the ground but otherwise we'd just sit back there and watch them_1 go in and out of those clouds	2934	A
yeah	2934	A
yep	2934	A
yeah you'd be amazed at how clear the sky was but the clouds are just really uh uh rolling kind of just real pillowy i guess	2934	A
oh well i was in that uh big tornado went through Wichita Falls	2934	A
and uh the sky i mean we were right in the middle of it when i mean signs and telephone poles were dropping all around us	2934	A
and a whole roof of a restaurant came off and uh it was a eerie uh a real eerie blue green color	2934	A
and the lightning was almost continuous just uh you know as if you put your hand on one of those electric uh things that causes lightning uh i think it was called the storm	2934	A
but um the sky- the whole sky was full of that eerie blue green uh lightning	2934	A
um	2934	A
uh-huh	2934	A
we haven't got that much rain but uh when it rains it's it's been down pouring	2934	A
you too	2934	A
okay thanks bye	2934	A
okay how's the weather been out there	2934	B
um-hum	2934	B
it's been pretty normal for this year you know uh they have tornadoes about once a week and it rains about every three days the last two years before they've had record rainfall	2934	B
by this time of the year they'd had enough rainfall for the whole year but this time we're only um i think maybe five inches ahead of of uh normal so it's not been bad at all	2934	B
i'm from Texas	2934	B
uh-huh	2934	B
and uh	2934	B
um they had some flooding in Houston the other day real real bad over i think it was over the weekend	2934	B
the radar just looked nasty with a bunch of red splotches all across it	2934	B
hum	2934	B
yeah that's that's right	2934	B
there you-	2934	B
um-hum so you get a lot more rain that way	2934	B
um-hum	2934	B
brings in that cold air and mixes it with the with the warm air coming off the Atlantic Ocean	2934	B
that's what	2934	B
um-hum	2934	B
is the temperature like sixty sixty to eighties there too or	2934	B
um do you get east winds a lot of the time from the ocean or	2934	B
um-hum	2934	B
um-hum	2934	B
that's the way it does here most of the time	2934	B
but uh sometimes it just comes straight from the north and then it and then it doesn't veer off to the east until you get down to Houston or or uh maybe mid mid Texas -depends on how strong the cold fronts are	2934	B
um well uh Richardson's a suburb of Dallas	2934	B
hardly ever unless there's a hurricane or something like that	2934	B
well uh it's kind of early for- for- i was going to say the weather man on on uh one of our stations was	2934	B
talking about the way that the weather's doing now is like tropical weather and he was afraid if it kept doing that that they'd have early- hurricanes- early hurricanes this year	2934	B
yeah	2934	B
kind of wiped them_1 out-	2934	B
um-hum	2934	B
wiped everything out	2934	B
yeah	2934	B
um-hum	2934	B
do you- do you get many tornadoes this time of year or	2934	B
um	2934	B
um-hum	2934	B
huh	2934	B
right	2934	B
um-hum	2934	B
and uh the uh	2934	B
uh you you aren't in the mountains or anything like that are you there's just hills- there's just hills	2934	B
um-hum	2934	B
um-hum	2934	B
yeah they they had a lot of them_1 they had a a huge one that was on um Inside Edition the other night in uh the southern part of Kansas	2934	B
um they took a bunch of film of it it it uh	2934	B
kind of chased them_1 it was a few hundred yards away and it chased them under an underpass and it was tossing around the car right before it got there and it tore up the people inside the car	2934	B
and the the camera man on the news crew held the camera out they were hiding underneath the underpass and he held the camera out as the tornado went by	2934	B
and you- the the wind you know it had a mike on it and the wind and everything was incredible	2934	B
i i'm surprised they didn't they because_1 we saw it on the news a couple of days in a row and that and you know and that was way up in Kansas but over here it's a lot it's a big thing about tornados and people that get pictures of them_1	2934	B
yeah you can really see them_1 well there yeah	2934	B
um-hum uh	2934	B
yeah	2934	B
it's really strange the way it does that	2934	B
especially the way it starts it starts you know just like a little swirl in the clouds and	2934	B
and uh then it just grows from there	2934	B
and it and and usually it's not even raining when it starts it's just	2934	B
um-hum	2934	B
that's right and they're black and sometimes they're even green colored	2934	B
oh yeah	2934	B
um-hum	2934	B
gosh-	2934	B
yeah	2934	B
um-hum	2934	B
yeah that's it	2934	B
wow	2934	B
and that's about that's what we get this time of year just all the way sometimes all the way through June the last especially the last two years it's rained	2934	B
um what i think it rained nine inches in in one one of the Junes the last two years and this year usually- we usually get about five inches in May and it's it's over that so	2934	B
um-hum	2934	B
all right well i hope you have good weather the rest of the summer	2934	B
have fun playing tennis	2934	B
bye-bye	2934	B
uh well i have uh seen Dances With Wolves which is probably the the best movie that i have seen lately uh i do not go out to films very often	2967	B
so as far as out of the house so we do get a lot of videos that we bring in uh and i see some that way but uh i am not real current on films how about you	2967	B
i hear that's really good but i haven't seen it yet	2967	B
yeah	2967	B
uh-huh	2967	B
oh cute	2967	B
oh dear	2967	B
uh-huh oh	2967	B
oh and he hears them or something and	2967	B
who wins	2967	B
oh great great yeah i had heard people talk about it and they say it was really cute but i hadn't seen it	2967	B
uh we usually wait and eventually- eventually it comes out on video and then we get it and see it that way	2967	B
and that is it movies are very expensive uh movie theatres here they are six dollars uh for evening performances and that is kind of steep	2967	B
i think i don't know how much is it in Dallas	2967	B
yeah you can do that but it is difficult if you if you work or you know	2967	B
uh that is taking the middle of the afternoon and if i am looking for entertainment usually i i have more uh time in the evening than i do in the middle of the day	2967	B
to uh see things what do you think of movies in general as far as the as the trends	2967	B
uh-huh	2967	B
yeah did	2967	B
yeah the quality i think maybe has improved in that respect uh the only thing that disturbs me is that now they think they have to add just a little bit of sex and violence in order to get a	2967	B
a tougher rating which suggests that that you know it will be more enticing to the to the public and a lot of times it is added for no real uh valid reason	2967	B
uh which does not make and i think Smokey and the Bandit was a little bit like that	2967	B
uh but Dances With Wolves did not seem to have anything added it was just all legitimate kind of uh film and that is where reason why i suppose it won so many Oscars uh	2967	B
because it really was good even though it is such a long movie you know they said oh people won't won't be interested in a three hour movie but it certainly gotten good acclaim everywhere it has gone	2967	B
oh oh yeah absolutely uh but much more true to life and i think that is that is the point	2967	B
uh they do not have to keep making up stuff if they want to make something good i hate sequels too i hate these uh you know number one two three four	2967	B
usually if a movie is good once is enough	2967	B
right	2967	B
that was on Prime Time Television here uh recently at seven thirty in the evening and uh it was kind of shocking because that is a scary movie and children young children could see could have seen that movie	2967	B
uh at that hour and i thought that you know that would not have been the sort of thing i would have wanted my children to see at that age uh i mean when they were young and here it was quite easily seen by anybody that turned on the TV	2967	B
uh which was a it was a good movie i mean it was well done but uh that is one reason why it was scary	2967	B
so but i do not know that i have seen any of the uh sequels to that	2967	B
i think one is enough	2967	B
yes uh-huh that is what people say	2967	B
oh	2967	B
yeah it just a touch	2967	B
well the whole movie is kind of far fetched	2967	B
but i mean the whole idea behind it is far fetched	2967	B
not not too often	2967	B
that has gotten to be a whole camp idea- idea now though you know if you hear that music you know everybody knows what you are talking about	2967	B
it's funny	2967	B
well it sounds like neither one of us are real movie buffs	2967	B
yeah	2967	B
uh-huh	2967	B
right yeah i saw it then too	2967	B
yeah it was good it was very good but uh um uh	2967	B
see i have uh teenagers in my house and of course sometimes they rent movies and you know have friends over or something and sometimes movies are here that i did not i am not even aware that i could have seen you know because my family tells me that that that it had been actually in the house before	2967	B
but i'd missed it but i did see it on TV and i thought it was good	2967	B
oh really	2967	B
uh-huh	2967	B
no kidding oh i did not realize that	2967	B
yeah uh you know the character that uh James Earle Jones played	2967	B
uh uh i teach in school and we are doing a book called Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison	2967	B
and i wondered if maybe he was patterned after him	2967	B
uh i do not know i had not heard anybody talk about it but uh he certainly could have been	2967	B
uh which was kind of interesting	2967	B
you know someone who uh who was a real activist but then took up the cause uh kind of gave up you know because he didn't think anything was happening and	2967	B
so uh it was kind of fun	2967	B
i do not know for sure but there are certain uh qualities that suggest it could be he because they were uh	2967	B
they were suggesting that this Ben was something of a recluse that he had stopped writing and had stopped you know and that is true for Ellison he he wrote that one book and a few essays and that is about it	2967	B
and uh has pretty much dropped out of public life	2967	B
but he is still alive and that you know that's what makes it so interesting	2967	B
and that book have you ever read that book	2967	B
Invisible Man	2967	B
Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison	2967	B
it is an incredible book	2967	B
it uh really is very very interesting i highly recommend it	2967	B
uh the yeah the movie the in Field Field of Dreams came out after uh that novel	2967	B
so it- it could easily have been patterned after him but the the movie did not have anything to do with with the story that i am talking about but i just thought the actor- the uh author could have been patterned after that uh	2967	B
i mean that- that character could have been patterned after him or someone like him certainly	2967	B
sort of interesting so	2967	B
well i guess we have talked probably our limit- time limit haven't we	2967	B
okay very good it was nice talking to you	2967	B
okay bye-bye	2967	B
so what movies have you seen	2967	A
uh-huh	2967	A
yeah i saw Dances With Wolves and uh Home Alone and	2967	A
yeah it is about a little kid that that his parents go off to Paris	2967	A
and they they forget all about him	2967	A
the oldest daughter they take a head count and the oldest daughter counts one of the neighbor kids instead of	2967	A
and he is up in the attic asleep because he got in trouble	2967	A
so she made him go sleep upstairs	2967	A
and there is there is a couple of burglars uh breaking into the houses in the neighborhood	2967	A
and uh	2967	A
yeah and he sets up traps for them all over the house	2967	A
uh he does	2967	A
uh-huh	2967	A
right	2967	A
uh-huh	2967	A
well it is six dollars and then but you get um matinee prices but	2967	A
uh-huh	2967	A
well i think they are a lot better than they used- than they were well like um	2967	A
in the early eighties or the during the like the Smokey and the Bandit era	2967	A
when it was they i don't think they were very good during that time at least there weren't as many good ones	2967	A
uh-huh	2967	A
uh-huh	2967	A
yeah	2967	A
and it was shocking at the end too so yeah	2967	A
yeah that is right	2967	A
uh-huh	2967	A
uh-huh	2967	A
yeah especially Jaws	2967	A
uh-huh	2967	A
right	2967	A
uh-huh	2967	A
yeah	2967	A
just more of the same	2967	A
in one of them they have a mother shark uh destroy a whole uh	2967	A
marina and an aquarium	2967	A
which is kind of far fetched but	2967	A
yeah	2967	A
uh-huh	2967	A
they hardly ever play music when a shark attacks somebody	2967	A
yeah	2967	A
well uh every once in a while i go but it it has to be like somebody that i like or	2967	A
you know i did not i did not go see Field of Dreams when it was in the theatre because i did not know it was any good and	2967	A
then when it was i i found out it was Kevin Costner when it was on um i guess ABC the other week then i	2967	A
yeah and then i really liked it	2967	A
uh-huh	2967	A
huh	2967	A
yeah	2967	A
it was really and then and then uh Shoeless Joe Jackson really was a player i thought they made him up and then i found out you know after i saw the movie that they they started talking about that scandal and	2967	A
yeah when the when the anniversary came up that was around the time of anniversary and	2967	A
then it was on the news	2967	A
uh-huh	2967	A
uh-huh	2967	A
yeah	2967	A
yeah	2967	A
yeah and i wondered who it was too	2967	A
huh	2967	A
uh-huh	2967	A
uh i don't-	2967	A
what is that Invisible Man	2967	A
uh no huh-uh	2967	A
did they make the movies after that or	2967	A
uh-huh	2967	A
right	2967	A
uh-huh	2967	A
oh yeah	2967	A
okay it was nice-	2967	A
nice talking to you bye-bye	2967	A
all right uh well that's an interesting topic	2997	A
yeah i've got three small children	2997	A
yeah	2997	A
well i basic feeling is that everybody performs some sort of public service no matter what career path they take unless they are just absolute dropouts	2997	A
and uh part of my reaction is that uh some people particularly those that are gifted and talented	2997	A
uh and highly motivated uh ought to get on with their lives and uh and do the thing that they do best	2997	A
you know if somebody wants to become a doctor or a uh dedicated professional and they're serious about it	2997	A
uh i hate to see their their lives put on hold for a year or two while they uh uh they do something that's uh not down their alley	2997	A
yeah	2997	A
um-hum	2997	A
um-hum well i think uh i hate to see things mandated for people because i like to see people have their choice freedom of choice let's not get into that subject uh	2997	A
yeah	2997	A
um-hum	2997	A
yeah	2997	A
um	2997	A
um-hum	2997	A
um-hum	2997	A
yeah	2997	A
um-hum	2997	A
yeah i think one of the reactions i had was when i graduated from college i was all set to uh go into military service and and do my part	2997	A
and uh when it the end of my four years and i got my degree and i started talking to uh some of the recruiters for different companies	2997	A
and uh one of them_1 sat me down and he said hey you know what are you going to do in two years in the military uh where are you going to go and and what's going to happen to you	2997	A
and they persuaded me that uh i could serve my country better by going to work for one of the uh military industrial companies in direct support of uh military operations	2997	A
and so that's where i've been ever since and so i don't regret uh not going into military service	2997	A
yeah but	2997	A
yeah	2997	A
yeah	2997	A
and uh everybody has there uh soapbox i have a lot of people come around to the house uh uh trying to solicit funds for some environmental action or preserve some form of wildlife	2997	A
and i turn them_1 down uh because i i choose to contribute directly in terms of energy and i've been involved in research diving on several occasions to uh	2997	A
uh gain information about the environment and it contributes to the uh body of knowledge so i'd rather put my money in that form directly and i think a lot of people do things like that that uh	2997	A
they have their own applications that get them involved in the public	2997	A
um-hum	2997	A
yeah	2997	A
um-hum	2997	A
yeah	2997	A
yeah well i think an awful lot is available at the present time i have a niece who's with me for the summer	2997	A
and uh she had done volunteer work for the Sierra Club	2997	A
in uh years past	2997	A
and she currently has a summer job with them so she's	2997	A
she's getting paid for what she used to do as a volunteer but she's getting more more actively involved with the uh Sierra Club	2997	A
but that's that's the thing that she wants to do	2997	A
um-hum	2997	A
yeah	2997	A
um-hum	2997	A
yeah	2997	A
yes it is do you have young people	2997	B
yes	2997	B
three small ones okay_1 would you feel like those youngsters could be raised with a balanced life understanding all of the aspects of their lives if they did not perform some kind of public service	2997	B
um-hum	2997	B
um-hum	2997	B
well you're looking at it from a perspective of something equivalent to the draft where you take two years out of your life and	2997	B
and serve as as a a a military- in the military however they didn't say that it would be required- required to be two consecutive years what about the option	2997	B
of requiring these young people to have two years of public service in association perhaps with their education and that they get you know how we have uh life credits in college	2997	B
experience credits why could those not apply in exactly that way you actually are using that as a part of your college education and it's a quote public service course	2997	B
uh-hum	2997	B
well it would be like an elective	2997	B
it would be the equivalent of an elective do you want to serve in the Peace Corps or do you want serve uh	2997	B
you know on a on a some sort of a social agency where you do volunteer work or perhaps you'd like to do reading for the blind for a couple of years in your spare time	2997	B
and it might be uh three hours a week that's what a class is	2997	B
three or four hours a week then they have a balanced view i think of	2997	B
what is out there i know that a lot of young people are raised in a very protected environment mom and dad don't want them_1 exposed to the kinds of things that	2997	B
they had to endure or they had to go through they want a better life for their kids and they do put them in this wonderful little cocoon and then when they get out in the real world and life does give them_1 a good smack they go to their knees	2997	B
because they haven't had the experience in helping people therefore they don't have experience in seeking help or in	2997	B
being helped gracefully uh i- i myself have done a lot of volunteer work but i am very apprehensive about accepting help	2997	B
i'm very independent and i don't care much for that and i raised my children to be very independent	2997	B
and yet they did their share of volunteer work we went to the nursing homes and carried Christmas gifts and we visited sick people those are all good community service behaviors and activities and they don't require a big bite of your life	2997	B
um-hum	2997	B
um-hum	2997	B
um-hum um-hum	2997	B
um-hum	2997	B
um-hum	2997	B
um-hum	2997	B
um-hum	2997	B
defense	2997	B
uh-huh	2997	B
right	2997	B
right but you did serve	2997	B
in in a different respect and that's what i'm saying you don't have to go into the Peace Corps in order to be of of service to the community	2997	B
um-hum	2997	B
um-hum	2997	B
um-hum	2997	B
um-hum	2997	B
um-hum	2997	B
um-hum	2997	B
oh yeah i do a great deal of you know i would rather expend the personal energy than just shell out a few bucks and let my conscience rest i feel like that you	2997	B
you- i don't know the the benefit to you is much of greater value if you are physically or emotionally involved in what you're doing it's- it's no big deal to be emotionally involved in writing a check	2997	B
i mean you know you don't really get involved and you don't really comprehend what you're accomplishing	2997	B
and i think that's important and that's the reason that i think that there should be some provision even if it's not mandatory	2997	B
at least provide the avenue through which young people can do volunteer work even if it is not a two year stint in the Peace Corps uh	2997	B
um-hum	2997	B
um-hum	2997	B
um-hum	2997	B
um-hum	2997	B
um-hum yeah yeah	2997	B
you got to remember though the nature of the person we're when we're involved with here you you can expect someone like that perhaps to be willing to volunteer to get expend the energy to go out and find	2997	B
the area where they match very well	2997	B
but it might be of interest to put in some sort of a formal system like they do the screening system in the military service okay you know what are your interests and what are your aptitudes let's see if we can match you to a job that you prefer	2997	B
particularly with you have the education to deal with it	2997	B
i don't know that may or may not be uh a useful choice but i do know that there are a great deal of young people out there who would say why do i want to go	2997	B
you know out and get mosquito bit and sleep- sleep on a hard ground when i can sit here in this cushy bed and not go out and and uh i can have my music and drive my cars and have fun through the summer	2997	B
and there are a lot of them_1 who just do not have that sense of consciousness and i think maybe something in place might build that sense-	2997	B
gosh i like just about anything we i think the last one we saw was uh Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Part 2	2913	A
well we don't have any kids but we like them_1 anyway	2913	A
well	2913	A
um we're late twenties	2913	A
no	2913	A
oh gosh	2913	A
oh	2913	A
it was it was actually better than the first one i thought	2913	A
what's the last movie you saw	2913	A
oh we were just when when the topic came up we i was asking my husband right quick what's the last movies we saw he said well Ghost and Turtles i really liked it	2913	A
not too awful bad	2913	A
yeah	2913	A
did you see Pretty Woman	2913	A
oh gosh	2913	A
yeah	2913	A
uh-huh	2913	A
yeah	2913	A
uh once in a while when i'm home	2913	A
yeah	2913	A
okay	2913	A
yeah it does	2913	A
yeah	2913	A
i think you'd really like Pretty Woman it was it was really a it made you feel really good it was just a happy movie	2913	A
yeah oh i saw that one	2913	A
i i was disappointed in it just because of how violent it was	2913	A
yeah	2913	A
yeah	2913	A
i don't like that	2913	A
i don't see why they have to do that i mean	2913	A
i mean know- everybody knows that it that the the language is there so they could just ignore it and	2913	A
you know	2913	A
use different words instead i think	2913	A
but i i think lately Pretty Woman's been my favorite i went and bought the video i've probably seen it about fifteen or twenty times	2913	A
that's okay	2913	A
that's okay	2913	A
now	2913	A
now i haven't seen Pretty in Pink that had um	2913	A
does that have Molly Ringwald	2913	A
i think i think Sixteen Candles was the name of it	2913	A
i haven't seen it either	2913	A
i do	2913	A
oh gosh	2913	A
oh	2913	A
hm i don't know	2913	A
but	2913	A
probably know him if i saw him	2913	A
i was just thinking another good one i saw not too long ago was um Sleeping with the Enemy	2913	A
that that's	2913	A
that's Julia Roberts' new movie	2913	A
yeah she's this one you know Pretty Woman was kind of a light comedy	2913	A
and a romance and and this one was	2913	A
a lot more dramatic	2913	A
it- it-	2913	A
well it-	2913	A
it was like uh it was a mystery- it was a mystery she disappeared from her husband- uh husband who was abusing her	2913	A
yeah	2913	A
yeah	2913	A
no it came out in the theater	2913	A
and i think you know around here it's already quit playing but i don't i don't know if it's still playing anywhere else	2913	A
but it was it was it was one of those that kept you on the edge of your seat	2913	A
oh okay because_1 we saw it probably	2913	A
four or five months ago	2913	A
yeah he's uh he was a real psycho in the movie it was it was scary	2913	A
oh yeah boy uh i- i didn't like it no it was i didn't like the way it ended	2913	A
uh-huh	2913	A
might have been Michael Douglas oh that starred in it yeah it was Michael Douglas	2913	A
huh-uh	2913	A
it was i- i it was it was weird it was a different movie from anything i've ever seen	2913	A
yeah	2913	A
yeah that'd be kind of hard for us we've only got one bathroom i don't	2913	A
oh	2913	A
well that wouldn't be too bad	2913	A
did-	2913	A
get around	2913	A
well did you see Fatal Attraction	2913	A
i know it's going to be on on the on CBS Tuesday night and and that's kind of what in a way you know how it kind of bothered you the way it ended and stuff that's kind of how War of the Roses was	2913	A
parts of parts of War of the Roses was funny but then other times it was like it was just deadly serious and it just left you with this kind of uneasy feeling you know	2913	A
i i've heard about that but i don't know what it's about	2913	A
yeah	2913	A
i love Disney movies	2913	A
i mean they're some of the best of that are made	2913	A
oh gosh-	2913	A
oh	2913	A
i don't think so	2913	A
nope i didn't see that	2913	A
so do i and a lot of times we'll go to rent a movie or something and and you're not sure how-	2913	A
whether it'll be any good or not so sometimes we stick with the stuff we've heard more about than	2913	A
yeah now we saw that and i and they're coming out with a sequel to it	2913	A
it was funny	2913	A
and and Working Girl is really good	2913	A

oh well if you like love stories it's sweet oh it's sweet	2913	B

i don't know he looks like a little boy next door	2913	B
but he's sixteen oh it's a cute movie i can't remember his name he kind of looks like Doogie Howser	2913	B
don't know either he's got curly blonde hair he just a little freckly little	2913	B
boy yeah if i could remember the name i know you'd know his name because he's played in a few movies but uh	2913	B

we got one back here a while oh i want to see War of the Roses too have you seen that	2913	B
you didn't	2913	B
i know well the only reason i know why it ended is on Arsenio Hall one night Christopher Reeves	2913	B
told that you know i can't believe they killed them_1 or or or who was it Christopher Reeve or Mike Douglas	2913	B
yeah	2913	B
Christopher Reeve wasn't in it at all	2913	B
okay well Arsenio Hall is the one that jumped up and said that i can't believe they killed them_1 and Christopher Reeve or Mike Douglas went after his throat you dummy so i know that they die but i haven't told my husband we've both been wanting to see it	2913	B
that's what well we was uh teasing about you know splitting our house down the middle	2913	B
they did that didn't they and they marked off routes that they could go or something	2913	B
we've got two bathrooms but well it- might- actually if he takes- my- my house kind of looks like two trailers put together and one bathroom is at the end of- of one side and one's in the middle of the other so we could do it	2913	B
no and he could climb out the window well- and we our whole house has you know every room leads to	2913	B
three rooms so we can you know yeah- well- yeah you can get around you just can't go out the front door honey sorry	2913	B
yeah that's coming back on too	2913	B
uh-huh	2913	B
hm well	2913	B
eerie feeling or i want to see it though i'd like to see that and uh The Never Ending Story came out on Disney this month i think i wanted to see that	2913	B
The Never Ending Story it's a child's movie but oh it's good i enjoyed it	2913	B
yeah i do too and	2913	B
yeah	2913	B
yeah and uh well it's about this little boy who uh i think he's up in a attic or some part of school he got locked in the school and he got scared but he starts dreaming and this	2913	B
oh he's saving the land of uh oh it's been so long since i've seen it	2913	B
all i know is- all's i can really remember is him flying this great big dog this great big huge	2913	B
sheep dog sort of looking thing it flies through the air and he's trying to save the land from some ooze but it's really good i mean it sounds kind- it it had uh Fred Savage in it	2913	B
no no no no did you see that movie with Fred Savage in it though with uh	2913	B
oh he had uh	2913	B
uh oh it was The Princess Bride	2913	B
you didn't see that that was cute that was real that was a good one i- i like i like slapstick comedy	2913	B
yeah	2913	B
well i heard a friend of mine told me she got Naked Gun last night and she said that was hilarious that	2913	B
two and a half	2913	B
it was- yeah i want to see that she said she rented it last night and said it was real good and	2913	B
now i seen that	2913	B
was that with that blonde she pretended to be the boss or something yeah i rented that one night by myself i was home alone did you see Home Alone	2913	B
i no i haven't seen it yet see we got TV-	2913	B
oh they range from	2914	B
from needlepoint to	2914	B
uh anything in the hobby field as far as um needlework is concerned	2914	B
i've had to give it up recently because um i've got problems with uh nerves in my right hand but basically it's anything in that hobby line i'll try anything including making uh earrings	2914	B
i have no love of yard work for hobby work though how about_1 you	2914	B
oh fantastic	2914	B
oh	2914	B
i've been in a uh	2914	B
glider	2914	B
which as a student pilot	2914	B
i loved it immensely	2914	B
as a student pilot yeah	2914	B
uh i was only in one one trip	2914	B
it was something i would have liked to have kept up but we moved out of Colorado so that was you know that ended that point	2914	B
but yeah that i'll try as far as you could say hobby then i'll try anything that's unusual that i've never done once	2914	B
just to find out what it's like the experience oh as	2914	B
but that's not a constant hobby you know like i'll do uh oh i'll pick up normally a petit point or anything in stitchery type of line	2914	B
and if i'm really bored i'll even pick up something and color it	2914	B
but i do a lot of designing also	2914	B
well i've done a petit point which is really extremely hard	2914	B
and uh that was very difficult for me it took me oh i think that almost took me a year and a half to finish that	2914	B
and petit point is like if you've seen	2914	B
regular needlepoint it's one half of that in the stitches	2914	B
and it goes down like real small little tiny it's exactly what it says petit point	2914	B
yes it was tedious i dropped it as i said it took me about a year and a half because_1 it's not something i could continuously do	2914	B
but now i'm into more uh taking something that i like and trying to actually put it onto paper myself	2914	B
which i find more enjoyment that's got a lot of math to it at that point	2914	B
uh this last one i'm trying to do a house there's a house here in Plano actually it's a real estate office	2914	B
but it has	2914	B
it's oh i would say it every section of this real estate office is a different type of a structure	2914	B
it goes from almost um castle looking on one side to a very old fashioned look on the other side and it just varies in each little section of this real estate office	2914	B
and i think they did it because of that purpose it is a real estate office	2914	B
but it fascinates me the way they've done it and it's it looks good it's all done in brick the windows even vary on it	2914	B
and that's it really fascinates me so i've sat across the street from it and i've tried to put it down on the paper now	2914	B
it's on um	2914	B
let's see fifteenth and uh Park	2914	B
well i live right around here	2914	B
but it's not if you drive by it you don't notice it	2914	B
because it's all brick there's no difference in the front except you can see the little difference if you actually stop and take a look at it	2914	B
that's why it fascinates me	2914	B
but uh again you know i'd like to be able to go ahead and take that someday and actually make a house of my own	2914	B
well see you're doing the same thing when you're doing your gazebo you're playing with numbers	2914	B
that's all this is you putting it on paper so you're just playing with numbers	2914	B
it's like i would love to play with work but i don't have the strength in my hands	2914	B
anymore to do anything like that but i've put up uh	2914	B
like um a wall board fixed a bedroom and put in a bath	2914	B
yeah i have a small miter box uh for hobby mitering	2914	B
and it does the same thing what you're saying but i'd like to which i've been trying to find to go into as far as a permanent hobby which because i'm having difficulties with this is to go into uh i'm sure you've seen it is those wood	2914	B
uh	2914	B
oh they're they're wood pictures on the wall but if one move if one part moves it counterparts the other parts	2914	B
and so like it's a continuous counterpart around it	2914	B
and it's all made out of wood	2914	B
and i have as i said i have a miniature uh	2914	B
miter box which is made for hobby works	2914	B
and i've had that for quite a few years now but i haven't really gone into that part i've been thinking about making um	2914	B
oh ladders and everything for my uh pocket parrot because they're hard to find toys for a pocket parrot they make them_1 for parrots and they make them_1 for cockatiels and a pocket parrot's between the two	2914	B
and so i need rings that are exactly between those two sizes so i'm going to i've got some designs for i go into the pet stores but you can say again another hobby i've got is my birds so	2914	B
hum	2914	B
i have a cockatiel and a pocket parrot	2914	B
but um	2914	B
other than that	2914	B
uh Sam uh cockatiel talks he whistles at me and says good morning	2914	B
uh he picked up most of his sayings from the other cockatiel i had the pocket parrot is a very quiet bird it's an extremely tame bird	2914	B
it's uh if you're real gentle with it when you buy it it'll come out and sit on your shoulder with no problem	2914	B
yeah they're a very very tender bird	2914	B
well see when i was oh about i guess about ten years ago fifteen years ago	2914	B
i don't know if it's been that long i took my dog my cat and my bird into the vet at the same time	2914	B
and he was just sitting there he goes Carol you're the only one i know of that does this and i go what's the problem because i never thought about it i had never thought one thing at all about it and of course the dog and the cat and the bird are all out of the cage	2914	B
and uh my- my bird at that time was picking the feathers out from underneath his wing	2914	B
and uh he finally said well you ought to get it a mate but the bird turned around and bit him he was furious he was so mad at me but yeah he had a picture of my birds	2914	B
sitting on top of the cage with one tail inside of a front of a cat's face and the tail of another cat walking underneath the cage	2914	B
so he just loved it he just absolutely adored it	2914	B
well the one large cat that i still have uh he took claw marks and put it down my drapes going after the birds sitting out on a	2914	B
bird rack that we set up outside for birds	2914	B
going after the birds	2914	B
and then he'd get down and jump back up on the table and sit next to a cage that had two cockatiels out on top of the cage i'd get so mad at that cat because_1 i didn't realize what he was doing until i saw these big claw marks going down my	2914	B
drapes from his back claws	2914	B
yeah i didn't think i didn't appreciate it too much i mean it's rather i thought it was rather funny here's a bird doing this and two birds sitting right next to him but	2914	B
i mean the birds were out they weren't in the cage they were out i never left them_1 in so but i thought but i still have that cat in fact i have both cats which are my kids' cats but the birds are in here with the cats they don't care	2914	B
they keep an eye on any cat that walks outside but they don't care about these cats	2914	B
i don't know what it is i've seen	2914	B
i've heard a lot of people that doesn't work that way	2914	B
i mean i've seen that dog my son's dog open up it's mouth and absolutely put it totally around the cat's head	2914	B
and the	2914	B
okay well what are your hobbies	2914	A
hum that sounds interesting	2914	A
well uh my i've got some fairly bizarre but uh i do a lot of flying aerobatics for one	2914	A
which a lot of people don't do and uh woodworking i do- i do enjoy doing landscaping- some landscaping type stuff i build- i like- i enjoy working with wood and stuff like that building decks gazebos those types of things	2914	A
so but uh probably if i had to say my most favorite one was probably be uh flying	2914	A
did you oh you actually tried it before	2914	A
as a student pilot	2914	A
how long did you do it	2914	A
hum	2914	A
hum	2914	A
well needlepoint looks pretty	2914	A
i i think you know if it's done real nice- real you know if it's done right it looks really good	2914	A
hum	2914	A
boy that's tedious	2914	A
hum	2914	A
what type of scenes do you do	2914	A
hum	2914	A
i've been over to Plano quite a few times my brother lives over there and i've yet to see anything like that over there	2914	A
oh okay so it's it's on the other side	2914	A
hum	2914	A
well that's pretty neat though i would- i mean i wish i had that- that much patience to sit down and do something tedious like that but	2914	A
after a while it would just drive me nuts	2914	A
yeah	2914	A
hum	2914	A
i like things- i like i like building furniture probably the best that that sort of thing	2914	A
when i had the equipment and and the place to set it up	2914	A
i like	2914	A
things that are difficult to do i like to see if i can do it	2914	A
back when when i was in college i took lots of wood courses and then i i even did it after i was out of college i continued to do it and i built just about every stick of furniture in my house	2914	A
everything from dining furniture to armoire to the whole nine yards	2914	A
takes a long long time to do all that stuff	2914	A
um-hum	2914	A
hum	2914	A
um-hum	2914	A
birds	2914	A
birds	2914	A
oh those are interesting	2914	A
see which ones talk do do the do they talk	2914	A
hum	2914	A
about the only thing i had when i was growing up was probably a parakeet and canary	2914	A
and uh we could let it out and fly around the house a little bit	2914	A
and uh	2914	A
oh you- they wouldn't really you know didn't really want you to pick them_1 up per se but you know when i did they didn't they didn't give me a lot of trouble	2914	A
boy i bet that was interesting	2914	A
that's unbelievable i would never have thought that you know that they would leave you alone without trying to attack each other	2914	A
um-hum	2914	A
yeah that nice- nice expensive	2914	A
yeah	2914	A
huh	2914	A
well they get used to each other	2914	A
guess they know they have to live together so they may as well make the best of it	2914	A
okay what do you read	2968	B

uh-huh	2968	B
uh-huh	2968	B
now when i worked-	2968	B
huh when i worked at TI i read that more than i read the regular newspaper	2968	B
because_1 i would read that every day because you'd find ten minutes here that you don't have anything to do i know you do being an engineer	2968	B
there are sometimes when you've got ten or fifteen or even	2968	B
an hour off	2968	B
not much not in the area i worked in we had an engineer in there every ten minutes	2968	B
so	2968	B
yeah well it just encouraged me to read it	2968	B
uh-huh	2968	B
yeah	2968	B
well see that's me with the newspaper especially financial page	2968	B
i don't uh	2968	B
i read it so less and i watch so little TV i didn't even know what the deal was with this uh	2968	B
oh i i can't remember his name now him and his wife are getting divorced and he's a tycoon or something what is his name	2968	B
yeah Trump i didn't even know i still don't know what the whole deal was with that	2968	B
yeah immediately so that's all it was he was just having an affair on his wife	2968	B
huh	2968	B
oh that's got to be hard to go from really rich to poor	2968	B
which i'm sure he ain't poor	2968	B
yeah	2968	B
huh	2968	B
well see that's what i said i like i don't watch much TV anymore either	2968	B
but i've got three kids so it's hard to watch TV except for Donald Duck	2968	B
well i've enjoyed talking to you	2968	B
yeah and have a good holiday bye-bye	2968	B
uh well i read everything uh i guess uh what-	2968	A
uh	2968	A
well i like all kinds of in fact i was just reading uh a magazine now an automobile magazine uh	2968	A
i like historical	2968	A
uh books Time magazine	2968	A
newspaper how to how to do it type things uh	2968	A
uh	2968	A

oh no yeah no i'm not into soap soaps and all that stuff i'm uh not into novels at all really other- other than historical things uh	2968	A
uh i'm kind of a	2968	A
a chore person i like to do i'm again i'm i'm fix it person i i read all those kind of things	2968	A
yeah i'll buy car magazines course i'm an engineer i read the engineering magazines and the money magazines and uh	2968	A
well i am reading historical uh not- not a novel but historical book now about uh	2968	A
uh Russia before uh the the Czar not before the Czar during the Czar's time and what it was like and everything	2968	A
oh you mean the ancient astronauts things	2968	A
i've read some of that i i didn't quite- some of that is uh	2968	A
it is very interesting without question i i don't really know that they have the answers in those books that they they make conclusions in them_1 that may or may not be	2968	A
true but they're very interesting that- that they've what they've discovered	2968	A
yeah	2968	A
you are what kind of buff	2968	A
oh okay	2968	A
oh yeah right	2968	A
well i'm kind of a a hobbyist so i i read all those things that uh and being an engineer all those books that would bore everybody else you know how to do things	2968	A
i'm one of those crazy people that reads the directions it always make my wife mad i	2968	A
when she ever there's something i say well have you read the directions no i hate reading the directions i say well engineers we we are the few people in the world that read the directions yeah	2968	A
yeah	2968	A
um-hum	2968	A
yeah	2968	A
oh really	2968	A
oh yeah that	2968	A
oh yeah those are oh interesting oh you like science things	2968	A
uh i haven't gotten them_1 in a long time what is that uh one that's on TV that book uh National Geographic is really a fascinating book uh	2968	A
uh if you ever get those or even-	2968	A
but i haven't gotten them_1 in years uh they- they were kind of expensive i know people just collect them_1 like they're	2968	A
uh they have wonderful pictures- photographs and just amazing photographs that they've done	2968	A
um um-hum	2968	A
yeah	2968	A
it is it is they they they uh the photographers just got fantastic- fantastic pictures in those things uh	2968	A
um-hum	2968	A
yeah	2968	A
oh yeah	2968	A
you know i haven't uh	2968	A
of course it was it all books and things or was it anything- say anything but newspapers i've forgotten what the question was exactly but uh what do you read i guess in general or	2968	A
yeah uh i i glance at all newspapers i do like uh since the read- since the economy is doing so bad i never have read the uh	2968	A
uh financial pages more often than now you know and trying to analyze and look for some good news in in there you know	2968	A
uh to see if the	2968	A
well i've only been more interested because of things are doing so bad and everything i thought well uh see if there's anything in there that uh	2968	A
uh would be see- positive you know you always look for things with this- with this terrible recession that we're in uh to see if there's any good-	2968	A
oh yeah yeah it's uh hopefully uh we'll recover here uh	2968	A
yeah	2968	A
yeah right and he he yeah i know i don't really know if uh any one person knows uh	2968	A
uh what some of the problems are uh	2968	A
but there're there're some there're some interesting things in the paper really	2968	A
yeah	2968	A
it	2968	A
yeah no i glance at it- i i	2968	A
with- with the uh so much uh	2968	A
you sound like you have a family too but with a family and everything there's just so much going on that i uh actually i'm more of a radio-	2968	A
not more of a radio buff but uh it's easier to do when i do some chores or yard work or anything put the radio on and listen to that and	2968	A
oh yeah i do every time i come in uh	2968	A
i'll punch up but they call it T News and all that i i do get uh it gets a little bit of everything even the the last page is uh	2968	A
is sport uh	2968	A
listings and and different things uh and world news you know about	2968	A
you can read it in one minute you know	2968	A
um-hum	2968	A
yeah	2968	A
yeah	2968	A
yeah yeah	2968	A
oh yeah it it's it is uh interesting uh with the computer to read the computer news and all that i i guess that's uh	2968	A
that- that is a source of reading i hadn't thought about that in that respect uh	2968	A
oh yeah yeah it it does have a good uh	2968	A
simple uh you know again you can read it in uh a lot less than ten minutes it's usually you can you- you can page through	2968	A
i don't read everything on some of the stuff's pretty boring i i skip over some of that but uh	2968	A
uh it is	2968	A
yeah	2968	A
yeah yeah well	2968	A
oh yeah uh uh Trump Donald Trump yeah	2968	A
well i guess because he was so rich you know when you're that rich uh you always get into the paper whatever if you have a family problem whatever	2968	A
well he had a young girlfriend he was he's well into his forties	2968	A
and i guess he got a young girlfriend who uh and uh and then every every time you take	2968	A
you you are that rich you just get uh in the the in the news immediately- immediately you know	2968	A
uh which is tough	2968	A
well that and uh his business is going down the tubes so bad you know	2968	A
he was uh uh essentially like you said a tycoon	2968	A
uh Donald Trump and had it- all he was high roller for about ten years and then he is now uh essentially bankrupt you know	2968	A
and so uh he	2968	A
yeah yeah	2968	A
no right uh who knows uh what he's really got but uh	2968	A
he was kind of an arrogant- arrogant guy so i think the newsmen uh enjoyed uh writing about him on his way down you know	2968	A
and his wife was very uh uh seemed to be very smart and actually running some of his business it was uh	2968	A
she was actually somewhat of a business partner of his uh did very well	2968	A
Ivana Trump uh	2968	A
oh they they've been on all the news and everything in the in the papers and uh	2968	A
on Barbara Walters and everything else	2968	A
hum	2968	A
oh yeah i can imagine-	2968	A
right	2968	A
uh uh i know what you mean really uh	2968	A
okay yeah well uh hang in there and good luck with those kids	2968	A
right bye-bye	2968	A
okay	2970	A
well Rome's pretty small but uh we hear a lot about uh New York City there is a lot of crime down there and i am i am afraid to go down there because_1	2970	A
you know i mean you hear about people getting mugged You leave your car for ten minutes and it is stripped when you come back so	2970	A
no i haven't only to the airport	2970	A
no i am i work at for the Air Force so there is a base up here and	2970	A
bases are pretty safe because_1 they check your ID on your way in and	2970	A
right but even so we had a um um at New Years we had some people come in and uh	2970	A
like attack one of the planes because they were protesting uh the presence over in the Persian Gulf	2970	A
so	2970	A
yeah	2970	A
yep	2970	A
that makes it bad for getting out during a fire	2970	A
i don't i don't know it seems to i think it is getting worse because_1 i keep hearing things like i when i was home- i went home my parents live in Boston but i went home and we were watching TV and	2970	A
this thing came on where these a group of like five or six guys went and filmed themselves beating up people in the street and and robbing them and it was really disgusting and my mom was like they should just be all shot right now and	2970	A
i mean you hear-	2970	A
um	2970	A
yeah yeah um they weren't i think they were early twenties they were young men	2970	A
i know and how deprived could they be if they had a camcorder those are a thousand bucks	2970	A
yeah	2970	A
uh-huh	2970	A
yeah	2970	A
i wonder where	2970	A
i do not know i wonder where he gets it you know you must i think TV is bad because_1 they uh show all sorts of violence on	2970	A
yeah they don't they don't talk to their kids and take them out and and aren't there all the time so the kids are off to their own devices a lot	2970	A
oh definitely	2970	A
i think so definitely when you go to a restaurant like kids are running all over the place they	2970	A
yep but	2970	A
right i- i see that too in the Air Force especially- oh yeah a lot of uh especially since a lot of us are engineers where i work	2970	A
i'm in the Air Force and so	2970	A
people outside the Air Force doing engineering get paid a lot more than we do and so all the young engineers are like well i am just going you know get it for all it is worth and that you know and i am like you are the one who signed up if you did not want to do it and	2970	A
i like it so far	2970	A
oh probably not but um they pay for my college so	2970	A
yep	2970	A
it	2970	A
yeah and you never know who is watching either	2970	A
uh-huh	2970	A
right	2970	A
uh-huh this is New Orleans	2970	A
oh i'd hate to be there during Mardi Gras let	2970	A
uh-huh	2970	A
uh-huh	2970	A
i know	2970	A
you can't trust anybody it's it's really scary	2970	A
right	2970	A
right	2970	A
well you you hear about people opening the door and getting blown away or people you know	2970	A
uh-huh	2970	A
yeah	2970	A
uh-huh	2970	A
right	2970	A
yeah i wouldn't want to go by myself	2970	A
uh-huh	2970	A
i think our justice system needs to be stricter i mean because_1 everyone they do it and then they get out in a couple of years it seems like	2970	A
they're booked up yeah	2970	A
right um i do not i do not know because_1 i am not real up on a lot of news things but you know you just hear about that that you know it is a lot of repeat crime	2970	A
and you are like why are they repeating they should have been in there longer or	2970	A
it seems like a lot of it that it is more like in Boston there was a case of uh a couple of kids fifteen year olds they wanted to see what it was like to kill someone so they they picked on this kid who was like new in town and they were like well no one was going to miss him anyway	2970	A
you know and it like ugh that's horrible how can you even think like that	2970	A
yeah	2970	A
right	2970	A
oh for the sneakers yeah	2970	A
yep	2970	A
yep	2970	A
yeah it seems like a crime is turning into a pastime instead of like you know be	2970	A
well i do not know how big a city is Rome i mean you have heard about Dallas and the- the crime here is pretty bad	2970	B
yeah i was going to say	2970	B
uh-huh	2970	B
yeah have you ever been there	2970	B
that is uh probably enough to see um are you in college right now	2970	B
oh okay	2970	B
are base that's interesting- interesting concept are bases safe you know	2970	B
yeah the they- uh minimize the access	2970	B
uh-huh	2970	B
oh no	2970	B
sure oh great that's wonderful yeah well Dallas uh we lived in Minneapolis uh we moved here about ten months ago and	2970	B
Dallas is pretty uh well we live in north Texas- north Dallas which is like a suburb near a suburb called Plano so we are out of the city but it is uh	2970	B
it is bad everywhere in terms of uh you know the handgun situation um the number of rapes the number of muggings just it's it's	2970	B
i wouldn't say it's as bad as New York but it is pretty scary you know people put bars on their windows in certain neighborhoods and you know they call them ornamental grates but they're still bars	2970	B
yeah it really does and if you're a little bit claustrophobic but uh i don't know i mean the jails are crowded i- i i'm not a criminal justice specialist so i don't know what you know what can be done i'm	2970	B
you know	2970	B
uh-huh	2970	B
oh	2970	B
were they teenagers or like that girl in New York that got beat up by you know when she was jogging in Central Park a couple of years ago	2970	B
huh yeah but they so they weren't you know and were they uh were they were they obviously poor or deprived- you know that is really strange- sick	2970	B
yeah unless they stole it and i mean that is one big thing down here i mean they have like uh and they're not all young i mean they're eighteen to twenty four some of the young men and women but	2970	B
i mean you can you can see the Crime Stoppers ads on television or sometimes it's the same people that have been that have been observed and they still can't catch them	2970	B
and you are wondering how you know um we lived in Minneapolis and Wisconsin i mean there was all kind of i- i know i- i i know it is getting worse i do not know what the world is or is not um	2970	B
the in a small town in Wisconsin near Madison um a young boy somehow got a hold of a shotgun and killed his parents and his three brothers and sisters	2970	B
and the child had and he they said that he was twelve years old and he had uh he had not uh displayed any tendencies deviant or disturbed or whatever you know and you are thinking to yourself um i know	2970	B
that and i don't think a lot of parents i mean i don't i don't know how it is in the Air Force base but uh i just don't think a lot of people because of the economy both need to work you know i just don't think a lot of parents are that involved any more	2970	B
right and discipline i do not know how your folks were but i mean i sure knew as heck when i was growing up that uh my parents were	2970	B
the superior and i was the subordinate and you know	2970	B
it was sort of like there were boundaries and i do not think i do not know i think today a lot of parents um are ruled by their kids i i	2970	B
yeah right i mean they're not learning such as well like boundaries i mean i don't i see it in work place too sometimes i do not know how old you are but you sound- a little bit younger than me but i am in my thirties and i	2970	B
i- i see um even people that work with me that are ten years younger that you know they kind of have an attitude that- i hate- i- i hate to say it but it's that's just what it is it is an attitude like the world owes them something	2970	B
do you	2970	B
are you in the Air Force okay	2970	B
sure	2970	B
right	2970	B
right right and the Air Force is one of the bitter better military supposedly military- military experiences i mean	2970	B
pardon me	2970	B
i mean that is are you going to be a career person i'm digressing but i don't talk to many people in the military so i am	2970	B
that's the way to do it i mean and that's you know at least the Air Force is i don't know i just um	2970	B
i am nervous in Dallas i mean i you know i mean i go to like an aerobics class or something and i you know i um seventy women in your average size exercise class in a public um parks and rec building and you are supposed to feel safe but then there are all these	2970	B
it doesn't matter race but you know it's an inter-racial mix and you see these guys standing there watching you jump around in your leotards	2970	B
and i do not even think that way but i mean you just think to yourself	2970	B
you you just i mean nobody can think that that it can't happen to them no matter who they are or where they are at you know	2970	B
i mean did you i do not know i was in the grocery store this morning we um	2970	B
went to New Orleans for four days and came back late last night driving it's about seven hours um and that's a very we had never been there that's a very very neat town to visit uh in terms of the French Quarter and all of the things you hear about but the crime is so bad there	2970	B
i mean in all the tourist brochures you read about what you should or should not do how to carry your wallet um	2970	B
New Orleans yeah	2970	B
i would never yeah you just don't don't even bother it's not worth it uh the when we came back i don't know if you have seen i was in the super market this morning and on the cover of Time magazine there is a girl	2970	B
she is in Boston she is on the east coast somewhere real attractive young girl college freshman i college coed i think she is a freshman	2970	B
she'd been dating a fellow for several weeks and they went back to her dorm room and date rape i mean and it just	2970	B
she- she looked anguished i mean it was really just sad i mean didn't pick it up and read it but i should have but i just looked at the picture and thought what a world	2970	B
i mean i do not yeah i do not have any uh cure	2970	B
no you really can't i mean i they we lease out a really nice two story town home in North Dallas and	2970	B
they have a real big thing here people i mean even dry cleaners knock on the door and are soliciting you know they everybody wants your business kind of thing and my husband is the kind of guy he's	2970	B
he's sometime he was raised on a farm in southern Ohio near Dayton and i think sometimes it is just he and i are very different in terms of that i i mean i basically have started not to trust anybody in general street smarts	2970	B
and uh he opened the door i came downstairs and i was real upset and i probably got more nasty than i should have but i just said Howard you know oh my God i would not i mean	2970	B
oh yeah And it does i mean it is it is not a reason i mean i have been to New York You shouldn't deny yourself going to visit and all that	2970	B
uh but it is not any worse i used to work for a mortgage company that was owned by uh are you from Boston	2970	B
Home Owners Savings and Loan in Boston and i know i never felt	2970	B
i mean i've been to downtown New York City and i've been to downtown Boston and i never felt any safer on Milk Street in Boston staying at the Meridian i didn't pay for but i mean i never felt any safer there than i did in any other city in any other city i have been in you know	2970	B
so i would say one thing do not deny yourself the New York experience- but experience but go with people that you know	2970	B
no uh but i mean it yeah i don't know i mean i i guess i could go on and on about what to do about criminals uh i think the handgun i'm not real big on guns myself so i mean	2970	B
are the New York uh are the New York i do not know how the New York state prison system is but the	2970	B
are they booked up that is a way to put it they are booked up Are they paroling uh like murderers and i mean here it is just a real big deal they parole people that have killed police officers and then they are out doing it again	2970	B
uh-huh	2970	B
uh-huh	2970	B
i know and then you think i mean i have- i mean i can remember i haven't been out of school that long but it has been at least ten years and you think to yourself was it that bad back then	2970	B
or is it just i think that like you said television is it just that more people think there is like excitement in it you know i mean people that may have been close to the edge just go over because_1 they see something or read something	2970	B
uh-huh	2970	B
oh God	2970	B
it- it is yeah isn't it something i mean i i have a i am originally from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and i have a niece and nephew and i just um	2970	B
i mean my ten year old nephew says things that he is aware of that i am just going Michael how did you hear about that	2970	B
you know it is just i think kids get too much too fast and all those sort of things in Atlanta where my inlaws live um they had that thing you know the high top sneakers the Air Jordans et cetera	2970	B
kids killing each other and beating their brains out you know right or the or the jackets the team like the Raiders and the caps you know stealing the hundred dollar jackets um	2970	B
i mean it is i guess it goes from the most petty like that to like what you were saying that they in Boston that is crime where they videoed that is probably one of the most bizarre i have heard of where they videotape themselves	2970	B
yes what what major changes have affected your life	2957	A
you mean yourself or women in general	2957	A
um-hum	2957	A
uh-huh	2957	A
uh-huh	2957	A
uh-huh	2957	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2957	A
that's interesting because that relates to the thing that that strikes me the most and i'm sure you've you've labeled the cause because what strikes me the most in uh the changes in society is the way kids behave	2957	A
and	2957	A
that's right that's right and you know i mean i was thinking it just you know my complaint would would be um that i think that	2957	A
you know the kids in the neighborhood run wild and they they destroy property and they you know steal each other's toys and stuff and there's just no respect for for people or property	2957	A
and i guess you know when you stop to think of it these kids have probably been deprived of a lot of attention that they've needed all their lives	2957	A
oh scary	2957	A
uh	2957	A
but for how many years	2957	A
um-hum	2957	A
oh that's great	2957	A
um-hum	2957	A
right	2957	A
um-hum no i agree a hundred percent	2957	A
hundred percent i guess i was lucky because_1 i was teaching and so i was able to just go to a class and teach when my son was little and so i'd be gone you know an hour and fifteen minutes or something at a stretch	2957	A
and then yeah very soon he was old enough to just go and sort of stay in my office and you know nobody seemed to have a big problem with that so that's an interesting issue though	2957	A
um yeah	2957	A
right i've actually another one that i a question i would have is i guess i'm	2957	A
being you know beyond the age of thinking of this this problem	2957	A
i had an argument recently with my boss i think it was about the need for women to work but i think you put your finger on it when you said that they're not respected if they don't work because it seems to me that	2957	A
a lot of people i know women i know are doing very uh menial jobs in a certain sense certainly financially	2957	A
and i mean when i see the amount of clothes that they buy and and how much it costs them to buy fast food on the way home	2957	A
i'm sure that they're not making quote making money for the family on this	2957	A
and and probably you're right	2957	A
well no even families that don't have child care i mean you know when i think of this one friend who makes probably twenty thousand dollars a year and i'm sure she spends at least that in clothes plus you know fast food every day and out to lunch every day	2957	A
and	2957	A
exactly and i mean you know even though they don't have children they they have relatives and you know the husband would certainly like a lot more attention and and she wouldn't have to hire somebody to clean the house and	2957	A
really sad	2957	A
oh that's true	2957	A
um-hum	2957	A
um-hum so that might be of a positive change in society	2957	A
um-hum um-hum	2957	A
i guess i haven't seen that as much in this area although every now and then you hear about it	2957	A
um	2957	A
but among you know people i know i don't see a great you know there are those people who have have had serious questions all along and you know are sort of pursuing it but	2957	A
um the churches here are growing leaps and bounds and i thought it was more because of the	2957	A
the very transient nature of the area and that people were going basically just as you said as a social to meet people and that	2957	A
but um it's hard to judge	2957	A
just you know the whole the whole environment i find	2957	A
um	2957	A
sort of you know i wonder with with all our chemicals and and that and and the foods we eat and you know young people that i know are getting very serious diseases and	2957	A
you	2957	A
probably	2957	A
well it's just it's maybe it's more unusual now when you know somebody quite young gets certain kinds of cancer and in the past maybe the same percentage got them_1 but we didn't know it or	2957	A
i don't know	2957	A
well i guess we've sort of run dry a little bit it was nice talking to you okay bye-bye	2957	A
well i think that uh women women working is the one that really affects me most strongly right now	2957	B
um	2957	B
well women in general and and also myself but um	2957	B
it used to not really- really make a difference to me	2957	B
um or at least i didn't think so but my mother worked and i kind of now wish that that she hadn't that uh	2957	B
that she had um stayed home and right now i'm kind of stuck because i'd like to have children but i'm not ready to do that because when i do have children i want to stay home	2957	B
so i'm having to uh try to figure out a way	2957	B
to be able to do that	2957	B
and in in our society right now that's really something that's that's um	2957	B
not respected and it's not	2957	B
it's not um	2957	B
it's it's not easy to do at all i mean there's a great deal of sacrifice that has to be made on the part of a family if the if the wife is going to actually be a mother	2957	B
um-hum i think that that they're well they have to be related	2957	B
um-hum	2957	B
um-hum i think that that's probably true	2957	B
i just wish there was a way i know that in in you know in Sweden	2957	B
what they have there it's really their medical plan but it also deals with this subject because if a woman um	2957	B
is working and i think even if she's not and has a child the government subsidizes her to stay home and raise the child	2957	B
i don't i don't know until it and um i'm sure until at least school age and maybe longer and what this does is	2957	B
it allows the government to subsidize her to be the mother of her children rather than to subsidize child care	2957	B
to raise the child for her	2957	B
and i think that that's a real a much much more viable solution really	2957	B
oh yeah that's great	2957	B
um-hum	2957	B
um	2957	B
goodness what else	2957	B
oh there's been so many how do you just you know	2957	B
um-hum	2957	B
yeah um-hum	2957	B
yeah really	2957	B
i don't see how they could be especially not if they have to pay for child care	2957	B
um-hum you're probably right if she sat down and looked at it she'd be like God what am i doing this for you know	2957	B
um-hum	2957	B
um-hum	2957	B
yeah religion has changed too	2957	B
um	2957	B
uh uh some people now it seems like are are turning back toward actually trying to find out what they're in it for instead of just um	2957	B
it it's it some places still it seems like it's a social club	2957	B
you know it's just a place to go to visit uh to wear your nice clothes and and to sit around and talk but um	2957	B
i think a lot of people are really you know searching now to find find out you know who they are and who God is and what all that really means now	2957	B
yeah well it's it's um	2957	B
it's beginning i think	2957	B
um-hum	2957	B
um-hum	2957	B
um-hum	2957	B
yeah	2957	B
um-hum	2957	B
oh yes well i guess that's always happened maybe not as much as now but	2957	B
okay	2957	B
nice to talk to you	2957	B
bye-bye	2957	B
uh well i would like to call myself that yes but i'm sure there's always something new to learn because we have a growing growing uh computer world out- out there	2980	B
no i'm at uh Texas Instruments um-hum	2980	B
oh golly numerous uh application presentations uh memos uh uh spreadsheets um	2980	B
just all kinds of things	2980	B
i don't do any plotting though i don't do any you know i don't do any uh device creations or anything like that	2980	B
like in AutoCAD i don't do those but we have that capability here	2980	B
uh-huh	2980	B
um-hum that's been ongoing for quite a while now is the speech recognition it's uh i don't know how old it is but i know they've been pursuing it for a long time	2980	B
that's right yes a lot of uh glitches to get out of it to work out of it uh-huh	2980	B
oh that's interesting isn't it	2980	B
oh my word	2980	B
um-hum	2980	B
well that's wonderful how are you advancing on your uh endeavors	2980	B
well great that sounds good	2980	B
um-hum	2980	B
yeah	2980	B
well that's wonderful that's wonderful now if we can get everybody together that has got all these uh uh new inputs that they're doing for speech	2980	B
and if- if they could get them_1 together and compare notes they probably would do well to jump a couple hundred feet in that area	2980	B
um-hum	2980	B
well that's good do you have	2980	B
do you have a group that uh you can interface with each other like uh	2980	B
who's interested in speech	2980	B
that wouldn't be a bad idea though do you think that	2980	B
uh-huh	2980	B
um-hum	2980	B
right	2980	B
um	2980	B
um-hum um-hum	2980	B
um-hum um-hum	2980	B
so it's that that soon	2980	B
um-hum	2980	B
it's going to be interesting to uh	2980	B
uh look at	2980	B
i'm not involved in it myself you know but uh just hearing what is going on at TI is very uh fascinating	2980	B
and i don't know that much about it i know that um in the group that i was working in there was	2980	B
an area that was really focused on speech recognition however i'm not in that uh organization any more within TI i'm in uh a different area of TI now working on something totally different	2980	B
oh it's definitely very fascinating	2980	B
uh-huh	2980	B
um-hum	2980	B
oh that's wonderful	2980	B
that's like almost giving them a um evaluation	2980	B
and going into the direction where they're gifted in	2980	B
that's wonderful	2980	B
um um-hum	2980	B
um-hum	2980	B
well you're you sound like you're very current with all that information	2980	B
uh i know it because you have children too and you're also interested in the uh	2980	B
uh voice recognition it's been so long since my my children- my grandchildren are in school now but i don't have to worry about them any more just worry about your children	2980	B
and uh let let the let the parents worry about the about their babies	2980	B
but you just know that their doing well so but i don't have any idea what's going on in the schools today	2980	B
i'm not active in any school other than paying my school taxes	2980	B
are you a computer professional	2980	A
but are you working at the Texas Instruments or are you at home	2980	A
okay	2980	A
uh what's what's your application for PC's	2980	A
oh okay	2980	A
um-hum	2980	A
oh okay	2980	A
well i got involved in uh computers because i have an interest in speech recognition	2980	A
which is probably why i got involved in the TI switchboard project	2980	A
and will probably be pursuing it for a long time to come	2980	A
yeah	2980	A
well i bought a uh PC oh well i bought a series of personal computers of one kind or another but the latest one i bought for the children	2980	A
to use uh for their educational games and and for entertainment games	2980	A
and i soon discovered that it was running faster than the IBM PCAT that i had purchased to do my uh uh	2980	A
postgraduate studies	2980	A
so i've uh i've taken over the children's computer	2980	A
and uh enhanced with uh uh	2980	A
uh Texas Instruments- DSP board	2980	A
and i'm using it for uh speech recognition research at this point	2980	A
well i've gotten to the point where the program will phonetically label a sentence that i speak into the microphone	2980	A
and uh it's it's just now up and running in that mode and i've got to make a lot of improvements and uh improve my models and	2980	A
adjust coefficients and try to improve the performance a little bit but the first results look promising	2980	A
i think we're getting to the point now where	2980	A
uh there's a lot of people who've done research in a lot of individual areas and we're sort of entering the phase now where i think we're starting to pull some of these results together and getting them_1 to work together	2980	A
well not really uh but	2980	A
well my company has has expressed an interest and they've asked me to do a lot of research so	2980	A
i've been traveling around the company country talking to uh different groups i spent uh three or four days in Boston earlier this year talking to MIT and uh Bobrank and	2980	A
and a place named Sonotek uh just to find out what their state of the art is and i see what's out there that can all be brought to bear on the problem	2980	A
and i think the focus of my dissertation is to uh to look at four different uh technologies that have already been researched and	2980	A
see if i can't make them work together in synergy to to get a step ahead	2980	A
and uh so i think that's probably the way things will go in the future they'll- they'll- they'll start pulling together the different aspects of speech recognition i would say that there will be	2980	A
well there'll certainly be a lot of commercial products on the market in the next five years	2980	A
and there'll probably some be some very good systems available by the turn of the century	2980	A
yeah uh there'll probably be some	2980	A
you know reasonable breakthroughs in terms of uh bringing products to market	2980	A
um-hum	2980	A
um-hum	2980	A
yeah	2980	A
yeah i think it's an interesting field and	2980	A
my primary interest is in speech understanding	2980	A
uh so once we get the the basic word recognition or something resembling word recognition	2980	A
uh my interest is in extracting the understanding and in developing uh man machine dialogue type operations like intelligent tutoring systems that uh	2980	A
the tutoring system can sort of gain some insight into what the student knows or doesn't know and modify it's tutoring program accordingly	2980	A
and uh getting the interactive speech is a key part of that	2980	A
but	2980	A
right	2980	A
um-hum	2980	A
well it's it's all of parallels techniques that teachers ordinarily use during the day they they're teaching a grade stool grade school student to	2980	A
add and subtract they they pose problems for them and they see where they make their mistakes in in carrying or uh in borrowing or something like that and they then pose problems which will	2980	A
you know point out the proper procedure and then test them_1 again to see that they've learned that fact	2980	A
and so that's that's where the artificial intelligence comes in is is in -developing that kind of an art in a machine	2980	A
huh	2980	A
right	2980	A
hm	2980	A
are you a Vietnam veteran Dudley	2959	B
no do you have family who were in the Vietnam War	2959	B
okay so he was too old and you're too young right yeah all right do you know some folks who have been there	2959	B
okay	2959	B
okay how did it influence them	2959	B
um-hum	2959	B
um-hum	2959	B
um-hum	2959	B
uh what about long lasting effects on him has he still suffering from those problems	2959	B
um-hum well i've talked with a number of Vietnam veterans and i really i had no one directly related to me involved	2959	B
but uh my sister's husband was in Vietnam and it it really made a completely different man out of him he went to Vietnam one man and came back another not better	2959	B
then uh another friend of mine went and he was in combat but he came back and he said okay that's it that is behind me i am going on with my life much like what Roger Staubach did	2959	B
he was uh he was a Vietnam war veteran and uh	2959	B
yeah that's true	2959	B
right and but uh most of the folks that i have met that were actually on the land or in combat are still still carry a lot of anger	2959	B
they really do and uh i- i- i- i really do not think that we did those young men right i think that uh Desert Storm shows a lot of learning since that time	2959	B
uh	2959	B
yeah that's true yeah	2959	B
um-hum	2959	B
um-hum	2959	B
uh-huh	2959	B
well you know one of the most troublesome things that i have	2959	B
encountered as a result is the incredible influx of southeast Asians into this country since that conflict uh not so much that i say i do not want you here but there is just such a surge	2959	B
of southeast Asians it has affected the culture of this country uh very much	2959	B
yeah yeah yeah well uh the culture's changing look how much more oriental food we have restaurants now for example	2959	B
uh	2959	B
even ten years ago	2959	B
there weren't that many a lot of shops are are operated by uh southeast Asians	2959	B
lot of people have complained in the schools there is a culture change there the southeast Asians seem to be very hungry there seem to be very studious	2959	B
and uh tends to cause our kids to really have to buckle down to keep up with them which is not bad not really uh but it might in the long run you can see where	2959	B
scholarships for example uh even jobs	2959	B
uh jobs that would normally go to an American with a lesser education	2959	B
might be going to to some of these people here and that is all a result of of of Vietnam and and you see a lot of a lot of men that were over there brought families back	2959	B
uh and it concerns me that there is probably a lot of mixed breed youngsters still there and i'd be concerned or interested to find out how they are doing now	2959	B
i know that they're	2959	B
you are talking about POW's or missing in actions	2959	B
native Vietnamese people okay	2959	B
oh i hadn't that hadn't- that hadn't occurred to me	2959	B
that'd be an interesting concept	2959	B
Cambodia	2959	B
um-hum	2959	B
um-hum	2959	B
um-hum	2959	B
um-hum	2959	B
um-hum	2959	B
um-hum	2959	B
well i think the terrain had a lot to do with the the success of Desert Storm as opposed to that in Vietnam	2959	B
you know there is incredible cover in Vietnam and you can't find much cover on in a sand dune	2959	B
that's right	2959	B
um-hum um-hum	2959	B
well	2959	B
um-hum	2959	B
um-hum	2959	B
um-hum	2959	B
what war do you think they found the experience for that	2959	B
don't you think they learned from the mistakes in Vietnam	2959	B
part of it's that part of it's technology but	2959	B
but when when	2959	B
when you get into trouble like that in a place like Vietnam you do tend to analyze the problems that you get into and you say never more and and you overcome those problems and you are prepared next time	2959	B
um-hum	2959	B
right um-hum	2959	B
sure sure sure	2959	B
well i know that from a personal standpoint people	2959	B
was one of the finest assets that we lost we didn't actually physically lose them they did not lose their lives but they lost a whole lot of the life they might have had	2959	B
uh being entirely different people i had dinner Monday night with a Vietnam veteran who is just now beginning to recover from the drug and alcohol struggle that he had	2959	B
that's a long time to suffer	2959	B
um-hum	2959	B
um-hum	2959	B
oh yeah yeah i can't uh	2959	B
oh yeah you bet you bet	2959	B
um-hum	2959	B
yeah well you see that's what the veterans are so angry about now they say well we're going to listen to this and we're going to look at this find out what our mistakes were and we're not gonna make them_1 again but that doesn't undo the ones that were done and that's what makes the veterans angry	2959	B
and i can't blame them_1 i don't know a solution	2959	B
but i sure can't blame them for being angry on the other hand you know you can be angry about something for a very long time or you can say well that is the way it is and go on with your life	2959	B
uh	2959	B
for the most part i wish that it hadn't happened but it did so	2959	B
that's right	2959	B
oh yeah	2959	B
well it has been that way for a very very long time though i can remember when i was in the sixth grade and that was many years ago we were reading about the French struggling with that in southeast Asia	2959	B
so and and and the Asians historically have always had these kinds of wars going on there there has not been a lot of peace in that part of the world	2959	B
i really i don't know it- we should not have maybe gotten involved but if we did we certainly should have supported our people who were there more so supported them_1 when they got home	2959	B
and uh i am afraid that they were treated as castaways for the most part	2959	B
and i- i saw the movie Born On The Fourth Of July and i think it did a good job depicting the temperament of the times	2959	B
um-hum well Dudley have we pretty well discussed the subject well i think so i enjoyed talking to you uh-huh bye-bye	2959	B
uh no	2959	A
uh no my father was uh came in right after world war two	2959	A
i am too young yeah	2959	A
um yes a couple	2959	A
uh the the one guy i worked with down in Austin hated it uh he was a lineman down there and while he was there he caught some kind of a strange disease	2959	A
and uh all his hair fell out and he had like a hundred and five fever for a while and	2959	A
i do not think he was in combat so	2959	A
um-hum	2959	A
um-hum	2959	A
yeah	2959	A
right	2959	A
yeah	2959	A
but he was in the Navy though he was it makes a lot of difference	2959	A
um-hum	2959	A
oh yeah	2959	A
well the armed forces did so much to you know Agent Orange they did so much to their own people all during that time you know and they take- they take a even now uh they take a free hand as far as medicine and	2959	A
uh you know how they treat the war casualties you know if you come back and your leg's blown off you know or or it is hanging by a thread they still can't put it back together now but	2959	A
but what they do afterwards and how they rehabilitate- rehabilitate you	2959	A
um-hum	2959	A
yeah	2959	A
oh yeah	2959	A
it's about- it's about nine or ten percent now	2959	A
um-hum	2959	A
um-hum	2959	A
yeah	2959	A
um-hum	2959	A
yeah that's	2959	A
um-hum	2959	A
well they are probably not doing very well at all because_1 i know there's there's still people even in the Dallas area there are there are still people trying to get some member of their family back from uh Vietnam	2959	A
um uh native- native Vietnamese people	2959	A
yeah they were lost you know when they were little and and they could- never did get back or	2959	A
yeah	2959	A
and uh and uh that's is really a big waste because they didn't they didn't win they didn't regain any of the land that they had it spilled over into uh now i can't even think of the country but	2959	A
yeah Cambodia and to Laos and	2959	A
and all they did is run and hide and they weren't really fighting you know it it would've been the same as Desert Storm if all they had been fighting was North Vietnam	2959	A
but and i am not even sure who was involved more whether it was China or Russia you know they were pouring they were pouring weapons in there and	2959	A
and advising well digging tunnels for them_1 you know and there is no way that they could ever catch them_1	2959	A
yeah that is right	2959	A
um-hum	2959	A
yeah yeah and all they can do is dig in and they you know and then they try to camouflage the top	2959	A
well now even i think even now in in Vietnam they could probably have done a better job	2959	A
because they could they could kill all those plants you know which would devastate the country as far as farming from then on but and the and the Corps of Engineers i think do a better job now like they did in Desert Storm	2959	A
because they had he he dug a bunch of moats and filled them with oil and he set a lot of booby traps all along the way as they went and they had to you know they had to blow them up or	2959	A
or disarm them_1 and then they had to fill in little bridges all the way where he where he'd made those moats	2959	A
uh	2959	A
well- yeah partially uh-huh yeah part of it is technology yeah because all go ahead	2959	A
yeah	2959	A
i think that's one of the reasons that they've they've pretty much avoided getting involved in South America because	2959	A
look what happened when they were looking for Noriega and they lost him for four hours when they were right on top of him you know he probably just went down into a tunnel	2959	A
yeah that is right	2959	A
um-hum	2959	A
yeah and they they really need everybody that's that's stood there it's when in- in Vietnam i think it was much closer contact you stand there with a rifle and blow a a piece of somebody apart	2959	A
or blow their head off and that has to affect you if you are human you know so they had to work all that that anger out and the and the nightmares that come along with it	2959	A
i don't i do not really think that anybody can ever forget- forget that but they can they can reason and and try to adjust to to why they were there	2959	A
right	2959	A
um-hum	2959	A
right	2959	A
yeah and that and that was that was in the in the era when Kennedy was president that they were afraid of everything you know and and and they fought- initially got into it because of Eisenhower	2959	A
and he just he didn't want to be in it any more than than what we started out in August with Desert Storm and then it just blew up into the war	2959	A
French yeah um-hum	2959	A
right	2959	A
um-hum	2959	A
yeah	2959	A
right	2959	A
exactly	2959	A
um-hum	2959	A
yeah more than was apocalypse now	2959	A
yeah i think so yes it was nice talking to you okay bye-bye	2959	A
oh boy this is gonna be tough i'm in Plano	2927	B
exactly	2927	B
i guess the weather hasn't been too different between us	2927	B
what- what part of Dallas are you from	2927	B
oh north Dallas	2927	B
well jeez	2927	B
well then you've been getting quite a bit of rain also	2927	B
how about_1 that how does it compare to the years past	2927	B
uh-huh	2927	B
oh	2927	B
huh well what brought you guys down to Texas then	2927	B
how about_1 that	2927	B
that's great	2927	B
right well	2927	B
definitely i'm sure the winters are more mild here	2927	B
uh-huh	2927	B
sure	2927	B
it seems that progressively i've been down here five years just over five years now that every spring and summer seems to get more and more rainy	2927	B
huh	2927	B
uh-huh right	2927	B
sure	2927	B
right	2927	B
uh-huh	2927	B
true	2927	B
Colorado	2927	B
oh sure i i'm uh i'm very familiar my grandparents and all my relatives are from Wisconsin	2927	B
so i'm uh quite familiar with how it is up there and if you kind of interesting	2927	B
uh the people down here typically don't think it gets above you know fifty degrees	2927	B
and it's always snow you know but uh	2927	B
oh yes	2927	B
um-hum	2927	B
oh sure	2927	B
my parents just live uh thirty miles south of Denver and it can be sunny and	2927	B
and no problem in Denver and they'll be having snow	2927	B
so it's pretty amazing it can be that drastic in just a short distance	2927	B
uh it's getting to be more and more of a possibility	2927	B
it used to be no problem just because it was such a a rugged terrain and with trees everywhere but now as they start to clear more things out	2927	B
um-hum	2927	B
right	2927	B
yeah me neither	2927	B
but	2927	B
sure sure well it's been good talking to you good bye	2927	B
well i'm talking to you from Dallas what part of the country are you in	2927	A
well we can uh complain together or we'll swear we can complain together about the humidity	2927	A
no i don't think so i wouldn't think yeah i- north- far north Dallas yeah about a half a mile from Plano so we're in the	2927	A
yeah it's very very rainy i know oh	2927	A
um i don't know i haven't lived here let's see we moved- lived out of state	2927	A
in Wisconsin and we just we lived here ten years ago and when we first lived here we lived- we were in Garland East Richardson and um doesn't seem like it was quite as humid	2927	A
and i don't know then we went we lived in uh Madison Wisconsin for five years um for my husband's schooling and- graduate schooling and it just it's a lot cleaner up there but um	2927	A
it's a lot colder too so	2927	A
uh his job he came back to start work again for a different company so	2927	A
said here here's a here- here we are again it just seems a little more humid than it i don't ever remember	2927	A
course you know you only remember the good stuff but um	2927	A
i just don't remember the humidity	2927	A
this much rain and this humidity	2927	A
uh yeah they are actually though it was a lot rainier here in the winter uh we came back up August it's just a lot rainier than i remember it all the- through the seasons you know	2927	A
um	2927	A
yeah and i think it's because it's just getting more crowded and more polluted i really do think that's part of it	2927	A
um in in Wisconsin and Minnesota when they get winters it's um the- the winters are bad but not what you hear about it's just like down here when you hear when people here think it's a hundred and six people up north think it's a hundred and sixty down here	2927	A
hundred- i'm making that up you know when it's only like ninety five	2927	A
um it's just like up there when you hear it's forty below it's probably really only five below	2927	A
um and it's so dry that it's	2927	A
it's like going to Arizona- well probably what you Arizona used to be like you know it's just dry and cool so it's not it's not what you think it is	2927	A
um no there've been times though when it gets so frigid that you you can't stand it where did you move here from	2927	A
well there you could talk about that that's that's a strange state for	2927	A
oh there you go okay	2927	A
this is very true	2927	A
yeah right well actually the summers up there we thought were the most beautiful time of the year	2927	A
um in terms of Colorado i know my husband likes to camp and backpack and all the stuff i don't like um but i'd used to go on i worked for a mortgage company in Wisconsin and i did a lot of business in uh	2927	A
um Colorado- well Denver and that's that's probably one of the stranger things when you see the air inversions	2927	A
and then you go into the mountains and it's snowy and cold- uh it just was a very mixed bag in terms of Colorado	2927	A
is that strange	2927	A
yeah and then things like tornadoes- are there tornadoes in Colorado yes or no- i don't	2927	A
yeah	2927	A
the mountains yeah	2927	A
even i mean i'm originally from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and i can tell you that um	2927	A
they've even had in eastern Ohio and then- western Pennsylvania they've even had i'm going to say mini tornadoes for lack of a better word and and that's just a part of the country that it's rolling hillside	2927	A
that was unheard of you know twenty years ago	2927	A
um so i don't know what's happening if it's you know we are	2927	A
the greenhouse is- i don't really know	2927	A
it just you know	2927	A
it's definitely not as um	2927	A
i know i associate the pollution with weather in general so i guess one thing we do miss is that's a smaller town and it was- it was just- it just seemed a little bit more pleasant in terms of the atmosphere you know	2927	A
you too okay bye-bye	2927	A
well yeah i feel much the same way i've uh two kids right now one is two and a half and one's nine months and uh	2989	B
that age of course everything you do they're trying to learn to do and so uh it's important for you to spend time doing the things that you want them to learn you know that that they need to learn at the age you know	2989	B
reading and uh reading and playing nice with others and that sort of thing	2989	B
right uh-huh	2989	B
right uh-huh	2989	B
yeah it certainly does because_1 uh you know the things in the books seem so dead to the kids and you know unless they've actually been there or whatever because_1 i remember our family	2989	B
well we went- we went everywhere and uh	2989	B
uh seeing New England and uh being on Plymouth Rock and stuff like that was uh	2989	B
really made the whole thing more uh visual and you could uh read the things in the history books and understand what they said when it was like we need food we need to raise food quickly because_1 this- this place gets very cold very soon	2989	B
right because_1 if uh kids don't look up to you or or can't- can't feel they can spend time with you they're going to find someone else and uh	2989	B
you know nowadays there's a lot of people out there that you don't want your kid to emulating or whatever	2989	B
yeah that is nice	2989	B
yeah well it's um	2989	B
well it's uh	2989	B
uh ten o'clock here in Falls Church Virginia so that- the only reason i'm home is because_1 i'm home with a cold and the wife says well you need something to do talk to the guy on the phone	2989	B
yeah	2989	B
right yeah i'm uh electrical engineer by trade	2989	B
uh here in Virginia likewise we uh	2989	B
we do some projects every now and then we like to get support from uh other other companies as well so	2989	B
oh	2989	B
yep	2989	B
okay right bye-bye	2989	B
Wayne i've uh feel very strongly about parents doing things with their children and making time available even sometimes when time isn't available how do you feel about it	2989	A
yeah	2989	A
yeah	2989	A
yeah we went through this with our children and now with our grandchildren and i've always tried to do things with them uh	2989	A
like when you're at the little league helping out even though i'm not a good athlete myself i was able to help the coach in in just controlling the kids if nothing else	2989	A
and we've always uh oh tried to take our children and now now at this age our grandchildren	2989	A
to see and do things that otherwise they might not be able to i think that's just part of their overall educational process is to get out and see and do things	2989	A
yeah yeah so it's uh we have uh lived several places around the the US and we have where we've lived we've taken them to see and do things of interest and of historical significance in the area	2989	A
like when we lived in Tennessee we we took them to Washington DC to see all the capitol and and things like that when they were small	2989	A
and that just uh it helps i think the children to when they're learning in school to say well i've been there and i've seen that	2989	A
yeah yeah so uh that's the type	2989	A
yeah	2989	A
yes	2989	A
yeah	2989	A
yeah	2989	A
yeah we've uh	2989	A
gone through that uh i remember my parents didn't do all those type things and so i made a special effort with my children to do things like that and even now with my grandchildren i feel it's a very important thing to be done	2989	A
yeah	2989	A
yeah well i can remember one of the things i'm most proud of is uh when my son was i think it was in the sixth grade	2989	A
they had to write uh a little brief autobiography of themselves and about what they had done and what they wanted to do and	2989	A
i was very proud when my son wrote that he wanted to uh have a family and be able to help coach little league and do things like his dad had done with him	2989	A
a real- a real point of pride with me	2989	A
yeah	2989	A
excuse me we sound like we both have colds	2989	A
oh oh	2989	A
oh well you're kind-	2989	A
yeah well i'm sitting here on the ninth floor of an office building on the north side of Dallas Texas so we're- we're kind of far apart here	2989	A
we've uh this is a very interesting program i i've heard about here on this and when i signed up for it it uh looked like it could be uh make a real contribution in in participating and uh	2989	A
yeah	2989	A
yeah	2989	A
yeah i'm an accountant presently working as a contractor liquidating a	2989	A
again this is our home area we've lived here about seventeen years and it's uh	2989	A
we enjoy living here it's where we originally started out and we've lived up north for a while in Chicago and over in Tennessee so wound up back about two hundred miles away from where we started out	2989	A
well uh that's about all i can think to talk about right now it's been a pleasure talking with you	2989	A
thank you bye	2989	A
well uh it seems to me that uh that i don't know whether the jury system uh i i shouldn't say i don't know i don't feel very	2962	A
uh stronger that the jury system should be changed it seems to have worked uh uh time immemorial and when uh difficult decisions uh are made uh uh uh they generally prove out to be right by things that occur later on	2962	A
uh i know in some cases now in some states depending on the criminal code	2962	A
and uh a unanimous verdict isn't required and indeed some juries are no longer twelve people they're down to as little small as six people in i think in petty in in uh in uh minor felonies	2962	A
and uh and misdemeanor trials	2962	A
um	2962	A
i think that the judges should be left to do most of the sentencing simply because	2962	A
uh there's always uh there's there's always a jury that might be swayed uh by the moment uh to either be too lenient or too vengeful i guess	2962	A
yeah	2962	A
but i mean isn't that uh is that a reflection then of what's really happening in the real world if if if they keep giving everybody	2962	A
hundred year sentences and the people in various states it doesn't seem that people want to be taxed to build more prisons or even in for that matter	2962	A
uh repair the uh the lack of judges and and and other uh	2962	A
yeah you know that might be it i mean they they certainly	2962	A
i don't i don't know how it is in Virginia but in Florida now uh uh uh at eighteen years someone was just sentenced to eighteen years i heard on Today	2962	A
uh without any specific recommendation for uh uh uh uh uh uh	2962	A
uh waving the normal uh procedures and the eighteen years will uh translate into something like uh four point seven if every if the if the prisoner is a model prisoner and indeed the present overcrowding conditions uh	2962	A
prevail plus i guess there was some credit for time this guy had already spent in jail waiting for trial	2962	A
so uh yeah you might be right about that i i i do not know it just seems to me that only about uh from what i read only about ninety percent of the cases- only about ten percent of the cases come for trial anyway	2962	A
and uh only about uh four- four- four or five percent of uh in the in the very end or less than	2962	A
less than half the trials that go to uh uh less than half the cases that go to trial uh end up with- with uh with the jury actually making the verdict	2962	A
that most of it's plea bargained uh half way through or or uh most of the cases are plea bargained anyway	2962	A
but uh uh how do you feel about the about the jury system itself do you you think that should be changed or do do you know in Virginia whether it's if they have smaller juries or	2962	A
yeah	2962	A
yeah well i guess we do	2962	A
yeah i guess we always focus on criminal trials with with the jury but	2962	A
i know you have a right to ask for a jury in in any sort of a case that even where damages are	2962	A
are are uh are- are the results of some sort of a uh an action that you're bringing against someone else you can ask for that to be heard before a jury takes a heck of a long time i guess to get there	2962	A
in some states i i i don't know uh i should imagine Virginia from what i read uh uh is like every other state it it's faced with uh	2962	A
uh enormous costs to maintain the jury system and the prison system and the entire trial system because i guess everywhere i read that there's a shortage of judges	2962	A
not that they won't appoint them_1 but there's no budget for them i guess or	2962	A
and the courthouse that goes with them and the bailiffs and the clerk uh or clerks	2962	A
so it seems uh no i i i don't think i'd change it the more i verbalize it i i don't think i'd want to change the system	2962	A
i don't know what we'd replace it with	2962	A
yes	2962	A
uh and yet there are there are so many there are so many people in prison i mean the prison population uh as far as i i uh you know my impression of it is that it's that it's doubled in the last ten years and tripled in the last twenty	2962	A
i mean it so so i guess our population has grown some too but there there definitely is uh uh you know to me the one of the worst things that could ever happen uh from what i read and see and understand i mean i don't think i could handle prison	2962	A
i mean it was very difficult	2962	A
well there must be a a a a a very great degree of that but	2962	A
but there again i i don't know if the the jury system itself uh comes in to play there i would think that one of the things that sort of bothers me is the ability of course that it's a constitutional right that the press	2962	A
must have here is the the interviewing of jurors after the trial i mean that it seems to me that	2962	A
that that when a jury makes a decision they shouldn't be asked uh before television cameras and newspaper reporters how they reached that decision i mean i don't	2962	A
i imagine there's a certain certain right of the press to have	2962	A
the ability to ask that but i i would think i if i did anything i'd protect the juror from	2962	A
from any sort of an inquisition after	2962	A
yeah yeah	2962	A
oh yeah yeah well i do a lot of business up in Washington i was there during the during the trial actually yeah	2962	A
yeah yeah yeah	2962	A
oh i felt that way i felt i felt	2962	A
no but	2962	A
yeah i always balanced in the in the situation i remember the jurors uh	2962	A
i thought to myself how did how did they only i think they only found- uh found him guilty on one count which was uh not even which was a class something felony which was not even punishable	2962	A
uh uh to the degree that they thought it but i don't know maybe when you're there in the room- in the courtroom yourself and you're sitting there and you've got to make a judgment on somebody	2962	A
and the prosecutors do a lousy job or maybe the evidence was as sensational as the media presented it i mean i i'm not making excuses for	2962	A
that might be it	2962	A
but i think i'm getting a call coming in	2962	A
all right nice talking with you thank you	2962	A
um-hum	2962	B
um-hum	2962	B
yeah on the other hand uh attorney uh uh justices are more apt to uh understand you know the crime- the prison crowding problems and things like that and have that sway their decisions one way or the other	2962	B
you know	2962	B
uh	2962	B
yeah i think that's what's happening i think uh the judges	2962	B
are trying to save the people from having to the cost of new prisons they're	2962	B
there saying oh well you know the the people can't afford it	2962	B
right	2962	B
right	2962	B
right	2962	B
with a conviction	2962	B
oh okay	2962	B
right	2962	B
um i don't know exactly what the size of the juries i know one of my friends was uh uh brought up for jury duty for and he only heard very you know {piddly} type cases	2962	B
most of it was uh	2962	B
robberies or things like that you know it wasn't any serious crimes so apparently even for the smallest crimes they give the person the you know any felony anyways they- they give the person the option for a jury	2962	B
um-hum	2962	B
uh-huh	2962	B
right	2962	B
right	2962	B
huh	2962	B
yeah whatever	2962	B
right uh i don't think i would either	2962	B
yeah i know it uh does seem like the the	2962	B
the the purpose of getting people in jail so that you know the the i can't think of the word i'm looking for anyways the deterrent	2962	B
for people to to commit the crime- uh to not to commit the crime is sort of gone away people have i don't know they just don't care any more the benefit i guess of crime outweighs what the deterrent is you know people that	2962	B
hum	2962	B
yeah well i'd be interested in finding out what the uh	2962	B
percentage of drug related type things are and uh	2962	B
yeah	2962	B
huh	2962	B
right	2962	B
um	2962	B
well i know uh on the other hand though when uh after the Barry trial up here you know that was a big local trial as well as national	2962	B
they want the guy to i don't know i mean just because you feel like he was being kicked on which he certainly was	2962	B
you know i think uh no doubt in my mind the federal government picked him out and selected him to be prosecuted	2962	B
but it doesn't matter the guy was obviously guilty	2962	B
one one count	2962	B
yeah	2962	B
right	2962	B
well yeah i think we're getting	2962	B
okay	2962	B
well it's been nice talking to you um-hum bye-bye	2962	B
have you ever uh organized a family reunion	2954	A
uh-huh	2954	A
um-hum	2954	A
how many people usually show up	2954	A
oh it is not that big	2954	A
because_1	2954	A
um	2954	A
we've had sort of	2954	A
weekends like that too but i never thought of it really as a reunion	2954	A
i sort of think of a reunion with my uh	2954	A
all the extended family	2954	A
yeah that would be hard for us because most of the family is out in California and some is in New York and North Carolina and it gets	2954	A
kind of hard to get everybody- get everybody organized	2954	A
uh is there someone do you all just sort of chip in and help out with stuff when you are there or	2954	A
um-hum	2954	A
so he doesn't live there though	2954	A
vacation home	2954	A
yeah it sounds nice	2954	A
um are there kids that are there too or mostly adults	2954	A
uh-huh	2954	A
um-hum	2954	A
um-hum are you all located in Texas	2954	A
um-hum but	2954	A
yeah	2954	A
do it that to me is you know	2954	A
Dallas i know of Houston i know of and that is about it	2954	A
in Texas the rest of it is sort of a big void to me	2954	A
but uh	2954	A
you know we have uh	2954	A
well we all got together it was about two years ago for i was i'd graduated from college and um	2954	A
i was going to live in France for a year and so my parents invited it wasn't just family it was friends too	2954	A
but um we all got together for just a party	2954	A
and that was kind of fun	2954	A
nice to have everybody be together at once and things like that	2954	A
well	2954	A
not quite French but uh	2954	A
it was sort of a reunion before leaving it was fun it was on um	2954	A
New Year's Day so it was almost a celebration of the new year too at the same time	2954	A
that was kind of fun	2954	A
but um	2954	A
who was it a friend of mine had a big family reunion a couple of years ago and you know everybody flew in from all over the place for the weekend and it really sounded like it was fun	2954	A
but	2954	A
i am not quite sure what i would do i think it'd be fun to like rent a big	2954	A
mansion or house someplace	2954	A
and have everybody meet someplace where they do not really know	2954	A
and have different areas to explore and things like that so that'd be kind of fun	2954	A
yep	2954	A
where nobody lives	2954	A
but at least that way it is at nobody's house so nobody one no one person is responsible for everything	2954	A
yep	2954	A
that's for sure the cleaning up can be a mess	2954	A
but um do you have horses or anything at your dad's farm	2954	A
does your- does your dad have horses there	2954	A
uh-huh	2954	A
i see so it's so he really does use it as a vacation home it is not like a farm that he has somebody else run for him or something like that	2954	A
um-hum	2954	A
well that sounds nice do people actually pick the fruit and things	2954	A
um-hum	2954	A
yeah i used	2954	A
we used to go pick wild blackberries at my friend's property but we never got enough i used to make jam but i never had enough to really make you know more than a jar or something	2954	A
so it wasn't so worth it	2954	A
um-hum	2954	A
that sounds is does he have a lot of land to go walking around and things there	2954	A
well that is pretty big	2954	A
i do not know how they do scale down there you know here it would be a huge amount of land	2954	A
yeah because_1 the person's house here that has a lot of space is three or four acres as opposed to	2954	A
tens of acres	2954	A
um-hum	2954	A
um-hum	2954	A
uh-huh	2954	A
yeah i think my dad put some we have a little pond at ours at his vacation home too	2954	A
and yeah- i mean really little and they were having problems with too many goldfish because_1 we had put some goldfish in and there were too many little goldfish and so the big ones never got bigger	2954	A
and uh somebody suggested to get a bass	2954	A
and so they went fishing and caught a bass near some place and put it in there and never saw it again	2954	A
no so we do not know if it is living or	2954	A
yep	2954	A
we still have lots of little goldfish they propagate pretty well those little fish	2954	A
this	2954	A
yeah because_1 we started we have got hundreds in there now and we started with i think ten or twenty little feeder fish that i picked up for a dollar you know many- no matter how many it was for a dollar	2954	A
and	2954	A
and some of them_1 are probably	2954	A
eight inches long but he wants your really big ones you know the ones that get to be like a foot and a half long	2954	A
and	2954	A
it	2954	A
oh okay	2954	A
well we we'd want to put some small ones in so they do not eat the big guys the goldfish too but yeah we could see i do not know if yellow catfish live up this way but catfish do i think	2954	A
um-hum	2954	A
so that you mean- well we could try it that is a good idea	2954	A
he's he was trying to catch them_1 you know using little uh	2954	A
i forget there's little uh nets you can use to catch fish to use as feeder fish and things like that minnow nets or something my father was taking those and trying to catch the goldfish and it was really funny because uh	2954	A
one time he left the net in the pond and he like would put some tuna fish or things in the middle of it to attract the fish	2954	A
and uh he left it in the middle of the pond and that night he came out and the trap was gone and it was a raccoon that had taken it	2954	A
so it was really funny and you could see that you know you could see where the trap the trap was dragged and things like that	2954	A
and so	2954	A
but do you guys have fishing competitions while you are there	2954	A
uh	2954	A
when they're feeding	2954	A
uh-huh	2954	A
what do you feed them_1	2954	A
really	2954	A
i mean it's especially made for catfish	2954	A
uh-huh	2954	A
that's funny	2954	A
um-hum	2954	A
uh-huh	2954	A
i have never seen catfish you know except in	2954	A
filleted- filleted on a plate i think maybe i think i have seen once or twice in like the museum	2954	A
but i've never seen them_1 just alive someplace that would be fun to see	2954	A
um-hum	2954	A
uh-huh	2954	A
how big do they get	2954	A
okay but how long in feet	2954	A
do you know	2954	A
that's pretty big though	2954	A
yeah	2954	A
uh-huh	2954	A
um-hum	2954	A
uh-huh	2954	A
um-hum	2954	A
yeah that sounds amazing i'll have to see them sometime	2954	A
but all righty	2954	A
nice talking to you too uh enjoy your uh weekend	2954	A

uh-huh	2954	B
yeah yeah	2954	B
yeah and	2954	B
and uh and most of it you know you just spend time on maybe ten acres of it	2954	B
and uh because_1 that's where the ponds are and	2954	B
where everybody fishes	2954	B
we kind of have a an informal contest	2954	B
my uncle uh put some bass in uh his pond a few years ago well he put some crappie too but the bass we have not been able to catch any of the adult bass yet so	2954	B
they're in there but	2954	B
they're real spooky	2954	B
uh-huh	2954	B
oh yeah	2954	B
um-hum	2954	B
never saw the bass	2954	B
oh	2954	B
oh it is probably in there just burping goldfish	2954	B
yeah	2954	B
yeah they really do	2954	B
um-hum	2954	B
oh yeah	2954	B
they have- there's a uh	2954	B
you might put some like some yellow catfish in there i do not know if they'd live very well up in New York but	2954	B
they get huge	2954	B
and uh they routinely use them for bait for uh goldfish for bait for yellow catfish	2954	B
um-hum	2954	B
yeah they live in the Mississippi River all the way through Minnesota and up into Canada	2954	B
um-hum	2954	B
um-hum	2954	B
uh	2954	B
uh-huh	2954	B
right	2954	B
um-hum	2954	B
yeah that's what happens	2954	B
yeah and uh	2954	B
we feed the catfish they feed the catfish like uh	2954	B
every couple of weeks	2954	B
and uh and sometimes that's the best time to catch them_1	2954	B
yeah because they'll just they will just come after anything then	2954	B
and you could catch a couple anyway during that time	2954	B
uh mixed Purina uh it is uh cat food uh catfish food	2954	B
yeah but	2954	B
yeah well i do not know how much different it is from dog food but you know it's um it looks like Purina High Pro	2954	B
but they come up to the top and it is the best time to take pictures because they come up to the top and you can see their whiskers come through the water and	2954	B
and they're the catfish- the big catfish just kind of vacuum the top of the water	2954	B
um-hum	2954	B
well they are really funny fish when you catch them they make a kind of a a burping growling sound at you	2954	B
and they try to hit you with their tails	2954	B
oh well the channel catfish get up to uh i think the world record is fifty something- pounds	2954	B
um that that is only about three and a half feet long	2954	B
yeah they get real fat	2954	B
um	2954	B
from the time they they stay slender until they get to be uh eighteen inches long and then they start to widen out	2954	B
uh my daughter we were up there one time and my daughter was fishing and i think that was when she was three and she caught a catfish by accident she was fishing for sunfish and she said here and she handed me her rod and reel	2954	B
and and uh you know	2954	B
it it was just pulling drag out	2954	B
and it swimmed wherever it wanted to	2954	B
okay it was nice talking to you	2954	B
okay bye-bye	2954	B
yeah have a nice Memorial weekend	2954	B
oh well my husband and i have gotten into some some problems with credit cards we don't handle them very well	2917	B
we we tend to run them up to the maximum and then ask for more	2917	B
they they're they're really bad for us um matter of fact we've gotten rid of all of our credit cards except for a MasterCard and a Visa	2917	B
then and we pretty much keep those {maxed} out	2917	B
yeah we had credit- i had probably twenty credit cards	2917	B
um for i had i had an American Express American Express Gold an Optima all the different department stores um	2917	B
two Visas two MasterCards	2917	B
i mean i had any time anybody would	2917	B
you know send me an application you know preapproved or whatever i went i took it and it really ended up getting us in some real serious trouble	2917	B
um	2917	B
because see the more the more credit cards you have the more people offer them to you	2917	B
um and the more you use them the more the more they send them to you	2917	B
exactly and the American Express was probably the worst- the worst	2917	B
um because the with the Gold card i can't remember how much it was because i didn't even have it very long before i gave it up	2917	B
but i know the Green card was like thirty five forty five dollars a year	2917	B
um	2917	B
which was a lot because i mean you had to pay it in full every month	2917	B
uh-huh	2917	B
um-hum yeah i had a Discover and that was one of the ones in the group that i ended up um closing	2917	B
um	2917	B
it really wasn't my choice though i mean i ended up having i ended up actually losing my credit cards um i ended up going through a credit counseling service	2917	B
um because my husband and i just don't handle credit very well	2917	B
and um when when you do that they automatically once you start with their service they close your accounts out	2917	B
so i'm still paying on all these accounts but my accounts are closed	2917	B
so and i would prefer to keep it that way once we once we're paid off	2917	B
um	2917	B
i would prefer just to have one MasterCard and one Visa and that's it	2917	B
i think that's a really good way to handle it because that way if you if you paid off every month you never have to worry about well	2917	B
how much do i have to pay these guys you know this month you know this you buy what you can afford i mean if you handle it just like you would like a check or cash	2917	B
um it's a lot easier to keep it in check	2917	B
yeah	2917	B
um-hum	2917	B
yeah and i and i think at this at this point in time with the economy the way it is	2917	B
um	2917	B
i think that um it's going to get even worse	2917	B
um	2917	B
i'm i'm glad that we're starting to pay our debts off- off now	2917	B
um	2917	B
you know we started- we started- i mean we started this last year	2917	B
and we probably still have about another year to go before we're completely out of the hole	2917	B
but i think this they way the whole economy's is going right now it's just not good to be in debt	2917	B
um-hum	2917	B
yeah	2917	B
well when- when it's you when you're getting rid of the whole credit card cycle and if you really get into the mind set	2917	B
i got really good at juggling money and basically robbing Peter to pay Paul and i and i it was scary because i was so good at it	2917	B
and i thought this this is not right i mean this has got to stop because eventually it'd end up catching up at and catching up with me and it hit me in the face	2917	B
um	2917	B
i yeah i have i've learned a lot from it um i've learned that credit cards are extremely dangerous in my hand	2917	B
and my husband's too because he's he's the same way i am	2917	B
i don't i don't think that	2917	B
well when we- when we buy on credit we just don't have a concept of how much money we're spending	2917	B
until the bill comes in	2917	B
and all- then all of a sudden you look at the bill and you go oh my gosh i spent this much	2917	B
yeah we pretty much use them for for emergency type things like um	2917	B
transmission fell out on our car	2917	B
and that paid for a new transmission	2917	B
um and and things like that um	2917	B
and we try- we try not to use them for you know	2917	B
incidental type things like you know gas and stuff like that	2917	B
yeah	2917	B
yeah	2917	B
i've i've gotten i've gotten a lot more away from from credit cards and i- i pay by check a lot more now	2917	B
i- i admire you for for having that um	2917	B
uh mind set for not not even getting you know past that thirty days i- i would that's ideally the where where i would like to be	2917	B
um-hum	2917	B
i can imagine	2917	B
yeah	2917	B
oh yeah	2917	B
um-hum	2917	B
you think about what you can buy for sixty dollars	2917	B
yeah yeah	2917	B
i- i think about all all the money that that we've spent on interest	2917	B
on all of our credit cards and it's just incredible	2917	B
we've never been able to take it off our income tax i'm i'm fairly newly married i've only been married um less than two years	2917	B
and before that	2917	B
i never owned a home or anything so i never had any deductions	2917	B
so really it was always just money	2917	B
thrown away	2917	B
and i never really thought about it because	2917	B
uh	2917	B
yeah i was so good at it that it just kind of got stuck in the back of my mind and just never	2917	B
um became a real problem until all of a sudden it came an insurmountable problem	2917	B
yeah	2917	B
most most people don't like to talk about money they feel uncomfortable i think	2917	B
you know because_1 i mean i guess for a lot of people it is very personal	2917	B
yeah	2917	B
but i- i think the the average American is probably	2917	B
pretty heavily in debt	2917	B
not not including like a mortgage i mean a mortgage is an understandable debt	2917	B
um because_1 that's you have you have to have a roof over your head	2917	B
and i would much rather own my own home than than	2917	B
be renting it like we're doing i mean we're basically you know kind of throwing seven hundred dollars a month away	2917	B
we're renting a house	2917	B
but	2917	B
but you know right now with the way our credit card situation is there's nobody in the world that's going to	2917	B
give us a mortgage on a house	2917	B
yeah	2917	B
yeah it's it's going to it's going to take quite a while um hopefully within five years we'll be in our own home	2917	B
but um i'm not really counting on it real soon	2917	B
yeah	2917	B
hi what do you do with your credit cards	2917	A
oh jeez	2917	A
oh i was going to say that that sounds like like pretty many but i see what you meant you had them for each of the individual stores	2917	A
um-hum um-hum	2917	A
oh gee	2917	A
oh sure	2917	A
um-hum um-hum	2917	A
but each of these had an annual fee also right	2917	A
um-hum	2917	A
yeah i'm forty five	2917	A
right i i	2917	A
exactly you know i that's it i really resented the fact that they were charging me for cards so i sent back all of mine except the ones that were free	2917	A
and um then then i also limited it to one of each	2917	A
one MasterCard and one one Visa and here most of the stores will accept those and actually i then got a Discover card since they pay you back	2917	A
uh	2917	A
oh	2917	A
um-hum um-hum	2917	A
um-hum yeah	2917	A
oh i see	2917	A
yeah	2917	A
yeah	2917	A
um-hum	2917	A
yeah yeah actually i pay off my cards every month only once in my life have i not paid	2917	A
um-hum	2917	A
right and	2917	A
um-hum um-hum	2917	A
well and also in a sense they're giving you a loan for a month so that	2917	A
you know if i were smarter i would have that same amount in savings and get the interest which i don't do but	2917	A
but yeah the	2917	A
the thought of adding you know X percent to to the price of what i buy i just i can't accept	2917	A
um-hum	2917	A
um-hum um-hum	2917	A
um-hum	2917	A
that's right that's right	2917	A
yeah yeah that i would that would be a very scary feeling for me to know that i was you know juggling payments to different people	2917	A
i guess because i never experienced it and it's not because you know i'm rich or anything it's just uh a mental concept that i have	2917	A
yeah that i just	2917	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2917	A
right right	2917	A
but it sounds like you know you you learned from it and you're coming out of it all right	2917	A
um-hum	2917	A
um-hum um-hum	2917	A
um-hum	2917	A
um-hum	2917	A
um-hum	2917	A
um-hum but now the fact that you still have two cards are you do you use them more judiciously	2917	A
uh yeah	2917	A
um-hum	2917	A
purchases	2917	A
um-hum um-hum	2917	A
clothing sales sales i find are a pain	2917	A
um-hum	2917	A
well it sounds good you know like i said it sounds like you're you've really got it under control	2917	A
um-hum	2917	A
um-hum um-hum	2917	A
yeah and like i said once once it it happened i couldn't because my son's tuition came due and i guess i had you know not really counted on it quite	2917	A
at that point but um yeah i didn't like it at all i was very uncomfortable so you know and and i mean it was	2917	A
i thought a lot sixty dollars interest or something for for just a couple of months and i'm going jeez that's outrageous but in in you know retrospect it wasn't all that much i mean a lot of people pay a lot more and	2917	A
and you know but still i mean i figured i didn't need those items if it cost me sixty dollars more to have them	2917	A
exactly groceries for a week yeah	2917	A
um-hum	2917	A
but now did you use to not feel so badly because you could take it off your income tax	2917	A
um-hum	2917	A
right right	2917	A
thrown away yeah jeez	2917	A
you were good at it	2917	A
um-hum	2917	A
yeah i suspect that you know thinking about it and looking at my friends and the number of credit cards that they use and you know the amount that i know they buy i guess probably a lot of them are	2917	A
in a similar situation and you know just don't talk about it	2917	A
um-hum um-hum um-hum	2917	A
very personal	2917	A
um-hum	2917	A
yeah and especially if you if you don't feel you're handling it quite right or that somebody might make fun of you or that it would be	2917	A
um-hum	2917	A
um-hum	2917	A
right	2917	A
um-hum	2917	A
um-hum	2917	A
right right	2917	A
but but once i suppose you you prove yourself by paying this off next year you'll be in very good shape	2917	A
um-hum	2917	A
um-hum	2917	A
um-hum um-hum so that's that's been an even harder lesson then if it affected	2917	A
all right so uh what about automobiles	2912	B
uh-huh	2912	B
you should live in Texas	2912	B
uh-huh	2912	B
uh oh you're in trouble	2912	B
you don't have a	2912	B
Yosemite Sam mud flap back off or anything like that	2912	B
uh-huh	2912	B
yeah	2912	B
oh well probably- that's probably a little more sound investment	2912	B
perhaps you should just uh dispel that thought	2912	B
but you still like your truck though	2912	B
uh-huh	2912	B
right	2912	B
yeah do you feel that	2912	B
uh you're the always the guy that gets called when someone moves or something	2912	B
uh-huh	2912	B
yeah	2912	B
yeah that's uh it just seems that uh i don't know if i'd ever want to own one because	2912	B
i know i've used guys with pickup trucks two or three times and and they you know what are you doing this weekend well i'm helping a guy move you know and it just seems like they're always getting the call	2912	B
well i have a eighty five Mercury Cougar and i've had it since well eighty six actually so it was still fairly	2912	B
you know it was a new style when it came out and uh my wife drives and eighty seven Topaz- or an wait an eighty eighty seven Topaz yeah that's right and so we're a Mercury family i guess	2912	B
um not so much on her part but i don't know my dad always bought Ford and Mercury products so and i like the looks of the Cougar	2912	B
yeah thanks and uh except for i got a some Texas hail storm damage it's a little golf ball action so i've got-	2912	B
driving- driving around a with a Chinese checker board basically	2912	B
i got that about a year and a half ago actually two years ago this May and i just totaled out the car	2912	B
and uh	2912	B
so it paid for itself and i'm basically driving uh almost a free car so	2912	B
yeah we haven't had a trouble with either of them_1 yet uh her Topaz uh	2912	B
uh my Cougar's got like eighty some thousand miles on it it's made trips because_1 we're both from Indiana and she moved down here first she she pardon	2912	B
uh yeah	2912	B
yeah i've made the trip probably ten times because_1 i was still going to school and she was down here and so it's	2912	B
just racks up you know about sixteen hundred miles each time	2912	B
and- and we just started going in Carla's car the Topaz and it seems to make the trip pretty well it's getting around thirty five forty miles per gallon	2912	B
yeah it is especially we- we were weighting it down a little bit it get it you know on the	2912	B
it averaged out around thirty five or forty- forty	2912	B
probably uh the Cougar i got it just for its looks	2912	B
and uh the the Mercury brand and uh Carla wanted a	2912	B
a car that got good gas mileage a little something to get around town and uh dependable and uh	2912	B
uh it it it's kind of a sportier model than most Topazes it's got the the stripping on the side and it came with uh i think Eagle tires	2912	B
some guy had some salesman had decked it out and uh	2912	B
so it it looked pretty sharp	2912	B
no no we we just got a new puppy but uh	2912	B
it's close enough	2912	B
oh so you don't- you don't have children or	2912	B
oh okay	2912	B
yeah	2912	B
that's funny uh see that's true i never thought of that and	2912	B
you know oh it's a good child- and you know loading up the kids you know we haven't crossed that yet so	2912	B
have you seen these new station wagons they look pretty sharp	2912	B
uh i don't know what it was i just saw it going down and mom and the kids were in there and it looked like a pretty sleek looking car	2912	B
yeah yeah	2912	B
okay_1	2912	B
no more of the the panel station wagons anymore	2912	B
i know they do look pretty sharp	2912	B
uh-huh	2912	B
so you you bought an Isuzu so you're not a a the buy American crowd or	2912	B
uh-huh	2912	B
uh-huh	2912	B
uh-huh	2912	B
yeah	2912	B
oh man	2912	B
that	2912	B
no kidding	2912	B
uh-huh	2912	B
well i drive a pick up truck	2912	A
and uh	2912	A
that's probably true it it's a small pickup truck though it's one of those Isuzu uh space cab types with a sunroof so it's actually not a real pickup truck you know it's uh it's got nice bucket seats so it's very comfortable and uh	2912	A
it has uh with the space cab in the back i can carry some storage but i have to admit Fred i i've never had a gun rack back there so i probably wouldn't fit in Texas	2912	A
no- no no no nothing like that it my it's pretty pretty i think uh	2912	A
my truck sort of puts me as a uh as- as a Baltimore Baltimore suburbanite i think is more uh you know i uh when i bought the truck i was going to buy a boat	2912	A
and i needed something that would be able to haul a small boat but then i i um i because_1 i wanted to try water skiing and enjoying some water sports and things and that's one reason why i bought it but then right after i bought the truck i broke my foot	2912	A
and i and the doctor said because of the type of physical therapy i got no sideward movement you know for a couple of months and that meant the whole	2912	A
season- uh water skiing you know uh season was over so i thought well okay and then by the the next year i was thinking about doing it again but i invested the money in a house	2912	A
you know so	2912	A
little more sound investment yes so so then i still have this pickup truck and then i think well now maybe i'll you know go by the boat again and of course then i broke my foot again uh so the thought-	2912	A
yeah that so that's so i'm not ever going going to own a boat	2912	A
yeah	2912	A
oh yeah i love my truck in fact uh well my wife and i contemplate selling both of us owned pickup trucks actually when we got married so we and now we're a two pickup truck family	2912	A
uh hers in- in some ways is is a little more convenient and then mine's convenient other ways so it's hard to decide she has a a cap on the back and and uh she has um	2912	A
uh roof racks so we were able to carry things on the roof and able to put things in the back of her truck without them ever worrying about them_1 them getting wet or whatever	2912	A
but with mine see i have a space cab so you can put like luggage immediately behind the seats and i also have bucket seats	2912	A
and air conditioning so each one has its good points and each one has its bad points in a two truck family yeah uh what	2912	A
i think family um i do a little bit but surprisingly i have uh two of my brothers since i bought my Isuzu pickup two of my brothers have bought uh Isuzu Troopers	2912	A
which actually you know can open the back and just take out your backseat and you can haul washers and dryers and almost anything in them so i think um i used to be	2912	A
the one that was called but now everybody owns one themselves you know i do have some friends every once in a while that'll ask me and i'll i'll of course do that you know that doesn't matter	2912	A
yeah it's for- for a friend you'd do it anyway so it doesn't really matter	2912	A
uh-huh	2912	A
yeah that's true what type of car do you drive Fred	2912	A
uh-huh	2912	A
yeah uh-huh	2912	A
uh-huh	2912	A
yeah	2912	A
yeah they're nice looking i like them_1	2912	A
oh really	2912	A
oh gee	2912	A
um-hum	2912	A
yeah well that's see that's what i'm hoping to stop paying truck payments soon you know that's i think that's payments are important what you so but your wife drives a Mercury Topaz they're nice too	2912	A
um-hum	2912	A
um-hum	2912	A
yeah so you've gone	2912	A
yeah back to visit family	2912	A
have you driven back to visit family	2912	A
in Indiana	2912	A
uh-huh	2912	A
uh-huh	2912	A
yeah	2912	A
oh that's really good yeah	2912	A
um-hum	2912	A
yeah is uh gas mileage an important reason why you buy the cars you do	2912	A
um-hum	2912	A
um-hum	2912	A
um-hum	2912	A
yeah	2912	A
yeah	2912	A
well i i take it you don't have you don't have kids then	2912	A
because if you had if you had kids you wouldn't say anything about sportier looking you'd be saying things like it has a good backseat	2912	A
uh the car seat fits in very easily and we can seat belt it in securely it's that's that's a big difference in conversations there yeah	2912	A
no we well we're uh just recently married in December	2912	A
uh but that's we we laugh now my wife says we should sell my truck and i say we should sell hers	2912	A
and i said well the reason why we should sell yours Laura is because_1 see mine has the space cab and it actually has little drop seats in the space area with seat belts i said and we can seat buckle in a car seat there	2912	A
so we should get rid of yours because the three of us won't be able to go on trips i said but we can go on trips in mine you know we can travel anywhere with my truck so that's uh you know we laugh- i laugh about that um-hum	2912	A
yeah	2912	A
i know- we haven't either but	2912	A
well what- the Ford ones	2912	A
yeah i think uh i think Ford was one of the first ones to step into that new um that new almost shuttle space shuttle like appearance and i think they've done they've really come on strong with some of that um	2912	A
uh wind resistance and energy saving and uh uh developments i think that that's their station wagon i think those are Fords but i do i like those	2912	A
yeah yeah now now the station wagon looks sleek it looks yeah	2912	A
and uh and hopefully i think uh you know it's supposed to get better gas mileage and um i think that's that's becoming an important thing too my wife and i've been discussing is you know looking for a car when we do get rid of one of the trucks we'll probably look for a car that gets good gas mileage	2912	A
just because um	2912	A
it it just has become such an important thing i think for the environment and for the economy and everything you know to start to pay attention to that more and more	2912	A
no i think i think the reason why i i bought the Isuzu is because you know i looked almost all the small trucks are made by Japanese anyway	2912	A
there's only a couple of them_1 like i looked the first place i went were the were Dodge Chrysler Plymouth and you know i went to a number of them and i priced them_1 all out and i was just the the i was almost going to buy a um a Chrysler which was actually a Mitsubishi truck	2912	A
but the salesman insulted me um the guy the salesman you know they always do that deal with you where they say well i got to go talk to my manager well here the manager's actually the guy that owns the place and in this small town we live on he's always on TV	2912	A
and he comes out of his office and i asked him for i- i i said well you know it was like maybe eighty three hundred dollars for this truck	2912	A
and i said well i i'd like it for eight thousand dollars i said for eight thousand dollars i'll sell- you know i'll write out the down payment now and you know because_1 i can get financing- i can get financing through my credit	2912	A
because_1 i'd checked about financing and everything you know i said i'll for eight thousand dollars i'll take it you know because_1 it was oh sort of marked down you know and the and the guy came out of the back and insulted me he said	2912	A
he said you want a truck for under eight thousand dollars go back to the used lot it's behind the building and he walked away	2912	A
i guess it was a sales technique he thought he was going to pressure me into giving up that three hundred dollars that i asked for i don't know and i said i said i looked at the salesman i said i'm i'm sorry your boss just insulted me i can't it's against my pride to buy a truck here now	2912	A
and guy- and i felt really bad i walked out and the guy	2912	A
called me at home the next couple of days it was terrible but you know i walked out i got in to my brother was actually with me shopping for a car and we drove down the street	2912	A
and he said why don't you just look in here and we went into the Isuzu dealer because_1 my brother always had this love for an Isuzu Trooper he wanted one you know	2912	A
and we walked in and here there was a demonstrator model on sale like ninety six hundred dollars with everything standard-	2912	A
yeah i was just wondering how did this get on my list how how did this subject get on my list oh well i'm not sure um	2961	B
well uh my children are grown now but i used care child care services uh for a number of years and i	2961	B
i don't know if i had it to do it over again maybe i would be a little more selective and really you know find out more about them_1 i think the main thing was that i needed someone to take care of my children and i and i generally used some place that was either	2961	B
you know uh close to where i lived or close to where i worked and i really never had any- had any real problems and i always felt like that they did a good job and um but i don't have small children now so	2961	B
uh i don't know if it would be different now you know i hear i hear i know a lot of uh mothers or uh people that i work with and they are you know putting their children in different places	2961	B
um	2961	B
so you	2961	B
yeah uh i suppose uh depends- it depends on what kind of program they have especially for summer summer programs	2961	B
um	2961	B
whether or not you know a lot of it is uh when they're in school and you know their after school thing you'd hope that they would have time for studying but most of the time they don't they just play	2961	B
but uh i think Summer time i'll i i know i was talking to one lady she's just changing her daughter to a different uh	2961	B
child care center for the Summer because they have so much more structured time and they offer different classes like her daughter's going to be taking gymnastics and she said if she had left her where that she was	2961	B
uh previously that a lot of time would you know just be free time for them to do whatever they wanted do and a lot of times they get bored so	2961	B
um-hum	2961	B
and i guess the ratio of of workers to children you know would be something to consider uh especially if they're little bitty children that would be a i would- i i would hate to leave an uh a real small baby you know	2961	B
uh before say before	2961	B
three or four years old anything anyone younger- younger than that i'd just kind of feel kind of uncomfortable about leaving the child but	2961	B
yeah but i did it so i mean but but i look back on some of the things that i did with my kids and i shudder	2961	B
um-hum	2961	B
that's true that's true	2961	B
so basically i think that that when they do that that person really feels a need to get out of the house and you know even if their the money is going mostly to child care they're not really having much to take home	2961	B
it's something a filling- fulfilling another- another need i suppose than staying home with with children all the time but that's a tough deal to do too too you know but uh it'd be nice to	2961	B
to work you know	2961	B
i don't know i don't know a good solution to that but but it's it's tough to be i started- i started to say stuck at home with children all the time and never getting out that that's just probably not a real good way to put it	2961	B
but some people you know they their their life and children can be a full time job and you don't have time for anything else so you	2961	B
so i would say maybe you know a day or two a week to get out to go do something else not necessarily go back to work or something but	2961	B
i don't know	2961	B
um-hum	2961	B
um-hum	2961	B
oh	2961	B
oh really	2961	B
uh-huh	2961	B
yeah i tell you it's uh	2961	B
yeah maybe it's something before you start having children you know maybe there's a lot of stuff- but but if- if	2961	B
but it's great it's great having kids and then	2961	B
uh yeah i think everybody ought to ought to try it	2961	B
yeah yeah she'll probably- she'll probably spend a lot more time finding the right place uh	2961	B
i don't know i i tend to think if they're licensed then they're you know	2961	B
i don't know i you know you- you can feel- you can get a feel from it too if your child is too small you can't but if you- if they're old enough to to know you know they'll they'll let you know if they're unhappy or if- or if someone isn't treating them well or	2961	B
i'll tell you one thing is that my of course i'm i'm a single parent and so i guess and um	2961	B
my my son was five and my daughter was two	2961	B
and i had uh they had to go in child care	2961	B
but uh but i think they were more uh well i uh	2961	B
my sister who had two boys and she did not work and she-	2961	B
and she had a real difficult time when the when time for them to go to school they did not uh want to leave her and my children who were so used to being out and	2961	B
uh learning how to get along with other children and taking directions and stuff like that they just went very smoothly off into school you know without a problem so	2961	B
i think even if you don't leave them_1 full time but have them_1 you know preschool or mother's day out or couple things a couple of days a week or something like that i think it's always good	2961	B
um-hum	2961	B
so	2961	B
you do	2961	B
oh	2961	B
oh what age	2961	B
um-hum	2961	B
um do they pay have uh their attention span is it do do you have a hard time holding their attention	2961	B
um-hum	2961	B
did you say uh your karate class is all boys or mixed-	2961	B
is that right	2961	B
why why would a parent want their child to take karate or is it the child wants to take it uh	2961	B
hm	2961	B
do you know something about how to take care of kids	2961	A
it's what	2961	A
i i don't know i've got mine	2961	A
well yeah i i don't have kids yet um i won't for a couple uh for at least two or three years and my wife is planning on probably taking care of them at that point um	2961	A
yeah	2961	A
that's actually yeah what i've been i'm thinking of the child care center because_1 they have like licensing procedures and	2961	A
and stuff like that that seems to me you know good and i mean it is a state license to seemingly more often than not that means that they're good and they have lots of activities and people who know how to take care of the kids	2961	A
and some	2961	A
um-hum	2961	A
with somebody else yeah oh i agree	2961	A
and	2961	A
i wonder actually i wonder about costs because_1 most people i know who who have kids you know uh	2961	A
one parent doesn't work a part of the time you know only works part time and takes care of the kid part time and then it turns out that that person's salary just winds up going to paying	2961	A
the people who who who take care of the kids	2961	A
you know that which- which amazes me um i i you know it never occurred to me how expensive that sort of thing can be	2961	A
yeah	2961	A
yeah that	2961	A
yeah i don't i don't you know i just yeah it it just strange because people do i mean in that sense it probably is pretty good to go out and just who cares if it if if all your salary goes to pay somebody	2961	A
you sort of get away for a while too we have i don't i don't um it's strange it's funny that i should get this particular we should be on this topic now because uh because we have even though we have no kids we have people staying with us	2961	A
um for the for the for the for the the weekend and they have a six a six year old son and a three month old son	2961	A
so i'm just sort of seeing what all the hassles are you know of you know like last night we we we the six year old decided he wanted to go camping in the back yard	2961	A
so we pitched a tent in the dark yard actually and his father and	2961	A
and the little boy and i all went out and had you know a a boy's- a boys' night out	2961	A
in the back yard and about quarter of one he woke up half crying and he couldn't sleep and this and that i mean we- we wanted to bring him inside	2961	A
so when about a one o'clock in the morning we all got up and sort of wandered inside so i'm think all the benefits of taking care of kids or all the fun part of taking care of kids i guess	2961	A
yeah we plan on a couple of years and i just like it's just like child care will become very important to my life then	2961	A
you know	2961	A
yeah that that that that's probably true although i i don't like you say i don't know if i'd put a kid there who's less than you know uh four years old or something	2961	A
yeah probably just to make friends and and stuff like that	2961	A
yeah i if it's just like i say this is a very foreign topic for me so	2961	A
one of those things i have to learn about i do i work with kids a lot	2961	A
i i i do work with kids a lot i uh i	2961	A
i do uh um i teach a karate class twice a week with with with kids	2961	A
um they're four to seven actually there's one at i work mostly with four to seven and then eight to twelve i i'm i'm the class so i i help out in this class and uh	2961	A
and it's really um weird because_1 i'm not you know the first when i first started doing it i i can	2961	A
put it this way it it it's helped me gain lots of respect for people who can work with lots large numbers of kids	2961	A
because when i first started like- i had no idea how to how to handle a five- five year old kid	2961	A
with- especially when there are ten of them floating around and you're supposed to be running around teaching them things and	2961	A
of course	2961	A
uh i i do but i'm finding there's there's uh another person there who has good- he has got absolutely no training from what i know but he's just wonderful with kids and he seems to know how to hold their attention you know he keeps them	2961	A
he does lots of you know he's he's he's fast moving with them they'll do this exercise they'll do that they'll do this they'll do that he keeps them moving quick enough that you know when they stop losing attention they start you know they're the all of a sudden they're switched	2961	A
and you know there're a couple in there who actually have um	2961	A
who i think have attention deficit disorders or they have very very low attention and those are harder to work with but i you know but i i i i uh the regular ones you know the normal kids you can just let them_1 go a little bit and	2961	A
and and he sort of he's real good at keeping them in line i'm learning from him how to do these sort of things just just by watching him	2961	A
no it's it's boys and girls	2961	A
it it it it's mixed there are uh there are um more boys than girls but there are a number of number of girls in there who actually uh do some good stuff and beat up a lot of the little girls i mean i mean a lot of the little boys too	2961	A
um in some case actually a lot of parents send their kids or just bring their kids because	2961	A
because of the sort of discipline you know and it it's not we don't you know say get down and do a hundred push ups for me now you little guy but um it teaches we we we focus very highly on you know on on on issues of respect and self-discipline	2961	A
and self-confidence we have a lot of students- kids who come in very shy you know and unsure of themselves and and you can see them come you know week by week that they come more and more out of their shells and start to become you know more sociable and more sure of themselves instead of more sure footed	2961	A
you know um and the parents love it actually they find you know we we we there are rules like the kids aren't allowed kids have to bring their report card in every after every quarter or whenever- or whenever they get their report cards they have to bring them in to make sure that they're keeping up with their grades	2961	A
okay i work for a temporary service and so our benefits are a lot more limited than what you would have if you worked a regular full time job	2933	A
we have to work a certain number of hours and then we get holiday pay and vacation pay and they if you	2933	A
um i could if i wanted to i'd i'm not right now	2933	A
um i have been	2933	A
yeah you like you have to work twelve hundred hours um within a year to get holiday pay and fifteen hundred hours within a year to get vacation pay so if you're not working enough hours to get that much time in in a year	2933	A
then you don't get the benefit	2933	A
yeah yeah you don't get anything at all	2933	A
uh-huh	2933	A
right yeah my husband has good benefits too or i probably wouldn't be able to do the temporary work	2933	A
i think medical is probably one of the most important things	2933	A
to have	2933	A
wow	2933	A
um-hum	2933	A
yeah those must be pretty good benefits i've heard that usually they average about thirty percent of your salary so it sounds like maybe his company's a little bit better	2933	A
right yeah	2933	A
uh no fortunately we still have the it's just regular traveler's insurance that my husband has so we can go anywhere	2933	A
i guess that's good i don't know uh i can't decide	2933	A
oh yeah	2933	A
uh-huh	2933	A
really	2933	A
yeah my husband works for a psych hospital and i know that they sometimes have to discharge people before they're really ready because their insurance	2933	A
won't let them_1 stay any longer it frustrates him because they'll just be getting somebody to the point where they can really make some progress and then they're gone	2933	A
yeah really	2933	A
right yeah	2933	A
yeah do you uh	2933	A
does your husband's company have any of the new like a cafeteria plan where he gets to pick and chose any of his benefits	2933	A
right	2933	A
yeah that's one thing i wish that we had was like a 401K plan or one of those things were they matched what you could save those are really good deals	2933	A
yeah	2933	A
that or retire i don't think we can plan on social security taking care of us so	2933	A
yeah with what they say about how the population's changing i think attitudes'll have to change to go along with that	2933	A
and that'll probably change the insurance benefits too as people get older and still work and	2933	A
they'll need more health care	2933	A
so	2933	A
yeah	2933	A
does that just supplement like Medicare- Medicare or	2933	A
yeah	2933	A
yeah that's good see i my husband been self-employed and he's worked for uh like a small companies and now he's in a little bit bigger company so we've seen a little bit of every kind of benefit you can have	2933	A
right	2933	A
yeah when we when he was self- self-employed and we had to get our own insurance	2933	A
to get maternity benefits was just ridiculous i mean you could- you might as well have saved the money you paid every month and paid your own hospital bill at the end of the year or something	2933	A
right	2933	A
yeah yeah it's scary	2933	A
well it was good talking to you	2933	A
you too bye	2933	A
um-hum	2933	B
um-hum um-hum	2933	B
so do you you say you work for a temporary but do you work full time hours doing that	2933	B
um-hum they	2933	B
but do they uh determine your benefits on whether or not you do work those hours or	2933	B
then they uh adjust it accordingly	2933	B
my uh husband works for a a large oil company and	2933	B
they uh and in the past has worked for a computer company and a bank so we've always uh	2933	B
always had access to to good	2933	B
benefits as far as insurance and and usually some dental and	2933	B
life insurance and that kind of thing you know and	2933	B
yeah exactly	2933	B
i know uh here sometime back you know they had- had had given him a printout you know of uh	2933	B
money that the company had paid into stock in his name and how much he'd paid and	2933	B
um the medical benefits and whatnot that uh he was entitled to and they estimated those benefits at about forty percent of his salary	2933	B
even including vacation like you said and paid holidays and	2933	B
and uh all of those things now some of those you look at and you say well i'm not going to need that or use that benefit but i guess it's there knowing that it could be used if you	2933	B
so chose	2933	B
yeah	2933	B
yeah i uh we've always been dealt fairly with that way	2933	B
and i would certainly you know	2933	B
caution any young person going into you know looking at jobs to make sure that they truly know what those benefits are and	2933	B
how they're going to match up and it might be wise to take a lower salary or hourly wage	2933	B
if you knew that uh long term the	2933	B
you were going to get more of a profit sharing or you know or just you know	2933	B
whatever you know the differences in the	2933	B
you know in the benefits we belong to an HMO through my husband's work is do you is that the kind of medical	2933	B
you have	2933	B
um-hum	2933	B
well we uh	2933	B
we have five children so it's been good for us to uh to have the HMO for the most part	2933	B
we're in a different one now than we used to be and it's required some adjustment but i think it in the end it will all come out in the wash their uh mental health benefits are very very low	2933	B
and anything that is elective of in any way could possibly be conceived as elective is you know not covered so	2933	B
if you have those kinds of services that while the general public may see them as elective you don't see them as elective	2933	B
then uh	2933	B
you know	2933	B
uh you know you may not get the coverage that's you might have	2933	B
uh-huh	2933	B
that's right that's right	2933	B
and i know that that is a is a concern and if those people aren't willing to	2933	B
go to outpatient you know therapy or something then that benefit is	2933	B
what what was paid is almost wasted	2933	B
and uh well i mean i guess you can't ever totally say that but	2933	B
need	2933	B
well yes i guess so you know uh	2933	B
but not uh not really	2933	B
you know there're there are some options in in every area whether it's medical or uh you know insurance or you know as a stock you know savings	2933	B
kind of plan that's subsidized by the company and that kind of thing so	2933	B
um-hum yeah yeah	2933	B
yeah we have been so grateful for that over the years because we uh	2933	B
uh that that's what our kids are going to go to college on i guess so	2933	B
you know it's good that	2933	B
no i don't think so i think there're going to be too many of us our age for any way that that system can possibly	2933	B
even barely lessen the load we just better be those of us who can try to do something anything to put away for	2933	B
hopefully we won't have such a attitude	2933	B
in our country about elderly people not being able to work and not being smart enough to	2933	B
lend a hand by the time we get there too	2933	B
yeah	2933	B
exactly so it's going to we're going to see a lot of changes in the next while	2933	B
i would think so don't you think yeah	2933	B
i know uh my mother-in-law has had to get individual insurance the last couple of years and she's seventy two	2933	B
and uh it's just been so difficult to get uh you know to get anything	2933	B
but uh	2933	B
yeah yeah uh-huh uh-huh	2933	B
like that so	2933	B
but	2933	B
you know i would say that overall we've been very luck and are very happy you know if if i had to	2933	B
you know	2933	B
um-hum	2933	B
yeah yeah i i work for part-time for a man who's self-employed	2933	B
and gosh you know he and his family- he doesn't do anything for me you know because i have what i need through my husband but uh it sure is rough for him it's providing for his family	2933	B
oh i know it	2933	B
yeah	2933	B
but you never know if you could have had that catastrophic thing happen to you know you or your baby where you'd need	2933	B
need somebody to jump in and take over those payments	2933	B
yeah it sure is well i appreciate getting to visit with you	2933	B
take care bye now	2933	B
well where what what's good in Washington DC to eat	2973	B
well you have a lot to thank your husband for noodles	2973	B
i live in a great place- i live in Berkeley California in what they call the gourmet ghetto it's uh	2973	B
it's it's it's got every well it's it's a very uh polyglot community you know got every every kind of ethnic background you can think of but	2973	B
just up the street is one of one of one of only two five star restaurants on the east coast less than a block i mean on the West Coast i think there's only like four in the US but	2973	B
uh well no it's French actually	2973	B
it she uh yeah yeah the the name of it is Chez Penny you may have heard of it but they uh they they they specialize in flower salads actually	2973	B
and they got you know	2973	B
well actually it's like thirty five dollars for the meal and that's you know and each night is a different that- that- there's never the same meal twice	2973	B
they	2973	B
yeah and you go in you know and of course it's booked for months on end	2973	B
but they also have a um a uh i understand a buffet or something that you know people can just walk in	2973	B
you know combination this is like during the day	2973	B
oh good	2973	B
oh no no no i'm one of those people that as long as it's good it really doesn't matter	2973	B
oh extremely yeah i was one of those kids that would go into a menu go into a restaurant when i was a kid and and and would not order unless i had never had it before	2973	B
well it's oh i was a i was a picky eater when i was real young but then i got to the point where i discovered that you know	2973	B
there was something other than than Twinkies in the world	2973	B
oh that's great	2973	B
oh i know i know i- i used to live back in North Carolina and i remember going to up to to Richmond James River and we'd get and and flounder you don't we don't get flounder out here on the West Coast	2973	B
yeah that's that's true that's true	2973	B
yeah it really is a lot of work but it's it's good really is	2973	B
uh yeah Baltimore Baltimore i saw a movie about Baltimore recently Abalon that's right	2973	B
uh-huh	2973	B
huh	2973	B
sure	2973	B
yes well uh uh of of course without two two sons it's- it's- it's also easier to go out isn't it i mean	2973	B
really you know i mean	2973	B
well uh basically it it's it's it's it's good food and and uh price comes into it some you know not not	2973	B
yeah well- that's what's really great about where i live here it's in in an area that's within you know four or five blocks there must be forty restaurants i'm not kidding it's just uh	2973	B
it's in you know it's just just down from the from um University of California Berkeley and uh and it's	2973	B
and that- that's what's good about it is that the- the- the- the prices are extremely reasonable and the competition is so keen that the food really is good so you know you	2973	B
one- one more time what was the name of that restaurant in Baltimore the German	2973	B
Hausners i'll	2973	B
have to remember that well Linda it's been a pleasure talking to you	2973	B
all right you have a good one bye-bye	2973	B
well i think we're very fortunate because um in the past twenty years Washington has really developed a a good number of quality restaurants um	2973	A
mostly although you have your normal continental we've gotten the excellent- excellent ethnic restaurants um we have Ethiopian restaurants we have Latin American restaurants	2973	A
um you know besides the normal range of French and Italian and things like that so uh we try to experience-	2973	A
because i am Italian background and my husband is Chinese we really try to uh experience quite a bit of difference in cooking styles	2973	A
oh God yeah but	2973	A
uh-huh	2973	A
um-hum	2973	A
oh my	2973	A
well what	2973	A
uh-huh is it continental	2973	A
it- it is French uh-huh	2973	A
uh-huh	2973	A
and i'm sure it's quite i'm sure it's quite pricey	2973	A
oh	2973	A
so it's a price fixed and you go in for the menu that they have	2973	A
yeah yeah	2973	A
oh that's interesting uh-huh	2973	A
what kind of food do you like	2973	A
any specific- any specific time	2973	A
and and you're adventuresome	2973	A
um-hum	2973	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2973	A
well we're very fortunate we have we have two sons and ever since they were even- even very little they we very adventuresome i mean they tried frogs legs an and they tried rabbit and all sorts of things so uh	2973	A
we've never had to have the problem of picky eaters	2973	A
and	2973	A
um-hum	2973	A
oh well they they've been they've been adventuresome since they were i mean even preschoolers they'll they tried anything	2973	A
yeah so um it's been fun- it's been great and uh of course in the area of Maryland where we are of course crabs are one of our big delicacies	2973	A
and	2973	A
uh-huh uh-huh	2973	A
oh i know but you get some other kinds of fish that are just wonderful i know that you have abalone out there	2973	A
and fresh i- there's nothing to rely- i mean fresh abalone is wonderful	2973	A
yes yes but uh you know Baltimore also is a wonderful eating city	2973	A
i'm	2973	A
okay- okay and Baltimore's got some great dining areas it's got little ethnic communities	2973	A
little pockets of ethnicity in the city and it's absolutely marvelous the it's sort of one of these underrated cities and they're some great restaurants there	2973	A
um it there are mostly um besides the little ethnic things you've got your great seafood places and there's one great German restaurant there called Hausners	2973	A
the owners of which um traveled all over the world and this place is room after room of art so that you feel you're in a museum except it's completely over done	2973	A
and it's it's a real place to bring people for something to talk about and it's a very German restaurant they've got the whole gamut of German dishes	2973	A
so uh when we go out i guess we look as you said you like to try when you were young something different we try to go out for either two things something to make it a festive occasion	2973	A
and to try something very unusual or else we go back to a few of our uh for Chinese restaurants we usually follow the chef	2973	A
if we know the chef's in a restaurant and what their specialties are so there are certain Chinese restaurants this is something i learned from my husband where you only eat certain things	2973	A
and uh other things that they don't produce in you know in quality but other aspect- other Chinese restaurants you would eat other things so uh	2973	A
yes	2973	A
so uh what's what's your major consideration when you go out to dinner	2973	A
um-hum	2973	A
yeah which would so it's fun to find good food for a reasonable price too	2973	A
um-hum	2973	A
oh that's	2973	A
oh well how tempting	2973	A
um-hum	2973	A
yeah	2973	A
yeah	2973	A
we have to we have to drive any restaurant where we're not in walking area of any even a store so we do have to drive but within- you know within a um	2973	A
fifteen twenty minute drive we have a whole span of of restaurants that we can chose from and unless you go into downtown Washington and the elegant areas	2973	A
uh even the some of the areas in Washington- you can get very reasonable and very tasty meals and uh	2973	A
Hausners	2973	A
Hausners H A U S N E R S um-hum	2973	A
yeah if you ever get out there	2973	A
well i enjoyed talking with you too all right bye-bye	2973	A
i know they have a waiting list and a quota on immigration now	2909	A
yeah um well i know that they're they're real cautious about letting Middle Eastern people into the country now because of all the terrorism	2909	A
what do-	2909	A
what- what	2909	A
what all do you know about it	2909	A
yeah	2909	A
um-hum	2909	A
that's right	2909	A
um-hum	2909	A
there i don't think there's much of much of one because i'm sure all the people from Cuba have been released from that camp that they were in	2909	A
and uh most of them it's just like Australia most of them were criminals from Cuba and i think that was just an attempt that that Fidel Castro to undermine you know	2909	A
the United States to some extent so he just released and got rid of all his criminals and sent them_1 to us	2909	A
and it's almost the same thing in in uh from Asia because	2909	A
a lot of- a lot of them was put out of business in Vietnam after the war and	2909	A
um-hum	2909	A
right	2909	A
um-hum	2909	A
um-hum	2909	A
yeah and uh a lot of the Mexican people just cross the border during the daytime to come over here and work	2909	A
and they have green cards and uh then like you said a lot of i run into people every day that can't speak English	2909	A
and uh	2909	A
and and most of them you know are working in janitorial positions so	2909	A
so i i don't know you like you said i don't know how much how much they're taking from the work force you know	2909	A
um-hum	2909	A
hm	2909	A
um-hum	2909	A
um-hum	2909	A
well that's i yeah i took Spanish in school and that's you know one reason that i did it is because	2909	A
because_1 whenever you travel anywhere near the border you know there more and more people speak Spanish	2909	A
well yeah well it's basically on the well i think it's mostly concentrated toward the borders and uh it's more um the immigration is tied in with uh drug trafficking so	2909	A
they have to watch out who comes in and and they're always finding drugs on you know on the most um innocent looking kind of	2909	A
i forgot what they found but a dog found it the other day you know on on the border	2909	A
um-hum	2909	A
that's right yeah	2909	A
yeah-	2909	A
yeah and one of the one of the things that really gets to me uh about the Mexicans is that um once they have children over here their children are American citizens then	2909	A
yeah and then they'll ship the parents back and that leaves the children without any parents so	2909	A
and they you know and they and and they just follow the rule no matter you you know	2909	A
so that doesn't seem fair to the children	2909	A
right	2909	A
um-hum	2909	A
yeah and then they granted them_1 amnesty if they could prove when was that and it was in the eighties sometime if they if they could prove they'd been here five years	2909	A
and uh a lot of them_1 had been you know some of them_1 some of them_1 moved back and forth but uh	2909	A
most of them_1 don't ever want to go back to Mexico especially the way it was then	2909	A
um-hum	2909	A
i think most you know like especially the celebrities and everything they just have a	2909	A
uh well they have to get a green card if they're going to do any kind of work you know in the movies and	2909	A
and such but most of them_1 have temporary visas	2909	A
as long it's like well it's- it's a kind of a	2909	A
a bad a bad example but when Rafael Septien	2909	A
took the job with the Cowboys they had to offer his job to any other applicant that could do it	2909	A
yeah	2909	A
so that you know and that's the thing with the jobs	2909	A
and of course no one beat him out so you know	2909	A
he just ruined his own career so	2909	A
yeah	2909	A
um-hum	2909	A
yeah i think so	2909	A
because there are other uh job- uh uh job opportunities in Europe that there aren't here and	2909	A
you know even um like orchestra- orchestra players can find a job sometimes in Europe when they can't find one here and um i'm a trumpet player	2909	A
uh no i uh i don't anymore i just went to school and i was a music major for a while	2909	A
but i had a trumpet teacher that played in the Mexico City Symphony so so he had to have a work visa there	2909	A
and of course they had a lot of musicians from from other countries and uh in the Mexico City Symphony	2909	A
but i think um like three out of the four	2909	A
other people in the trumpet section are from Mexico now	2909	A
but i think the conductor i don't know or one of the conductors is is from another country	2909	A
it's like any other symphony	2909	A
you know and then and Eduardo Mana's from Mexico so	2909	A
so he had to you know-	2909	A
i've lost track i don't really know i i do have some opinions but go ahead	2909	B
uh	2909	B
okay i hadn't thought about that uh	2909	B
uh well i just have an opinion now i didn't think i i thought the terrorism thing was overstated i mean there was nothing over here in fact even	2909	B
this is not our subject i guess but uh	2909	B
or maybe it is or isn't i suppose	2909	B
my wife when she talked about the Middle East and everyone's afraid you know of how the war was going to go and everything i said- i said i told her no it's just not going to happen there's not going to be any terrorism over here and there wasn't you know	2909	B
they- they just didn't have an organization but uh	2909	B
i i concerned- i'm concerned that we're letting too many that we don't have enough controls i think that uh	2909	B
the Asian gangsters that we've let in here and if and the guys from uh Cuba you know there there's a lot of criminals down in Florida that we've let in from Cuba that Fidel pushed off on us and uh	2909	B
and- and the last you know out of all the Asians we brought in there there's a tremendous criminal element that we let in from from Asia and i think that there's got to be some sort of controls over that i mean this Asia mafia thing is getting out of hand	2909	B
i- i don't i don't i didn't know what i don't even know what our controls are i don't even know what uh	2909	B
uh we- if we have any guidelines at all uh on on immigration um	2909	B
i always thought that we did but i don't i don't i don't i don't know what they are right now	2909	B
yeah	2909	B
yeah	2909	B
yeah the	2909	B
yeah	2909	B
because_1 we	2909	B
i i do have some sympathy with uh you know of course we have this big Mexican problem- not a problem but i think that we need to do something with uh the immigration of back and across- forth across	2909	B
Mexico uh	2909	B
i	2909	B
uh i'm sympathetic- i don't know what the answer is i guess i'm sympathetic certainly with that that that they they want to come over here and they i guess hundreds of thousands come over every year to work	2909	B
and if- if they have- if they have jobs you know i i hear the story about they're taking away American jobs but i don't know	2909	B
uh i don't know how many American jobs they are really taking away i'm so i i'm sympathetic but i don't have an answer i don't uh	2909	B
i think that we should have good relations with with Mexico that's not really exactly immigration it is and it isn't uh i i don't know to what degree we owe	2909	B
the people who come across before they're citizens owe the children education and all that uh	2909	B
although the idea- their education is an answer to a lot of problems in the world so	2909	B
i guess it's what they their the Mexican kids get a	2909	B
good education along the way maybe that's a benefit to everybody you know	2909	B
um-hum	2909	B
oh yeah	2909	B
yeah	2909	B
and that	2909	B
yeah i never thought that they were much i do cringe when i hear some of the problems we've had	2909	B
uh um uh	2909	B
of course you mentioned the language i i feel so bad that we here in Texas or certainly the southern part of the United States uh	2909	B
California Texas and all that just- why our kids don't speak fluid Spanish uh	2909	B
by junior high you know um as well as us you know	2909	B
so that we could wouldn't have a language barrier certainly now that is a shame that we	2909	B
uh have this tremendous border of Mexico and then- in Europe you know they they speak their French and all and they try they go out of their way to try to speak their their neighbor's language so they can understand we we certainly- we don't really even make an effort	2909	B
to speak Spanish and i feel bad about that	2909	B
uh go ahead	2909	B
yeah	2909	B
yeah	2909	B
i guess it's never too late i i do have some Spanish books and i've always uh every year i say i'm going to try to speak uh some newcomers language you know	2909	B
i don't know if it's costing us any money or how much money they're putting into it uh that's always a factor i mean how much my wife says they how much the federal government is putting into	2909	B
immigration	2909	B
yeah	2909	B
oh yeah	2909	B
oh yeah i i think that certainly is a problem uh	2909	B
i guess our immigration history that's a great subject uh they didn't say to talk about that but that is	2909	B
i mean uh on Ellis Island they you know they're redoing that and going to make it a museum a national museum	2909	B
now that certainly was interesting since all of us had	2909	B
uh ancestors that came over that way or not all but i guess uh i guess if you go back far enough you came over on a	2909	B
uh	2909	B
a boat originally you know but uh	2909	B
a lot of us have parents grandparents my grandparents came over in	2909	B
about eighteen ninety or something like that and i'm sure they came over	2909	B
you know through Ellis Island you know	2909	B
so uh we all immigrants in one way or or another well we certainly are coming from Europe you know or not	2909	B
oh yeah that- those were laws are unusual you know	2909	B
yeah that i don't understand i mean uh whose rule is that you know	2909	B
yeah sometimes common sense should take over rather than yeah that's a law doesn't sound like it makes any sense at all	2909	B
that you would do it that way	2909	B
you would think they could at least get a a a visa or something until they uh got citizenship i'm sure they want to	2909	B
oh yeah	2909	B
i heard something about that yeah	2909	B
yeah	2909	B
yeah	2909	B
oh no	2909	B
oh no i i could see uh	2909	B
you can see why	2909	B
i don't know how much immigration we have from Europe and everything what the controls are	2909	B
yeah	2909	B
yeah	2909	B
i guess you can get work visas pretty easily uh	2909	B
yeah	2909	B
oh really	2909	B
yeah	2909	B
yeah	2909	B
oh well yeah	2909	B
yeah well it's- it's still interesting after all this time that we're probably one of the	2909	B
one of the few countries that people are still you know desperately trying to immigrate to	2909	B
uh although i guess Europe now that the Communism is falling apart that maybe there'll be	2909	B
won't be that much of a rush to get out of all the Communist Communist- countries uh	2909	B
i guess Poland now is- now a non Communist so	2909	B
maybe not maybe immigration from Europe to here will slowly- you know slowly	2909	B
uh change maybe it'll be even out like trade you know so many people will	2909	B
immigrate here in- in the twentieth at at the year two thousand	2909	B
so many of the people who will go back overseas you know maybe it'll average out i don't know	2909	B
it doesn't has doesn't seem so far but	2909	B
um-hum	2909	B
um-hum	2909	B
are you a teacher	2909	B
oh really yeah	2909	B
yeah	2909	B
oh	2909	B
um-hum	2909	B
um-hum	2909	B
oh really	2909	B
um-hum	2909	B
yeah	2909	B
well do you watch much TV	2960	B
your kids how many kids do you have	2960	B
oh goodness i have got two	2960	B
that's about all i want	2960	B
yeah they do they're still babies	2960	B
oh well we have only get two channels we do not have cable but i am not crazy about TV much it just	2960	B
well it kind of is an idiot box now Sesame Street is a good program because uh i do have that on videotape and i will let him watch that every once in a while and he has learned to count to twenty from that so	2960	B
yeah	2960	B
uh-huh	2960	B
okay	2960	B
right	2960	B
right but they also have a lot easier time disciplining their kids than real people do	2960	B
yeah	2960	B
oh i love Quantum Leap	2960	B
yes that is a good show	2960	B
uh-huh	2960	B
uh-huh	2960	B
right he always got to change history is what it is	2960	B
usually yeah that it is so good i was glad when they put that back on this channel because_1 like i said we only get two channels because we do not get cable	2960	B
and still my little boy he watches videotapes he won't hum this is terrible i do not like him sitting in front of the TV all day	2960	B
well	2960	B
it but it is a not really a good baby sitter	2960	B
it's really not he needs to get outside and play and he's four years old and he just does not like to go out there by his self	2960	B
and i'll let him watch the TV when i am wanting to get my house work done	2960	B
but other than that i do not like him glued to the TV all the time	2960	B
huh	2960	B
uh-huh	2960	B
well we made the mistake- right we made the mistake of getting Robocop and that is one of the worst oh i do not let him watch it anymore because just- the pieces l	2960	B
like especially where they kill somebody it is just not good i mean it is just real violent i mean	2960	B
uh-huh	2960	B
uh-huh	2960	B
you would see somebody get shot they would just fall down	2960	B
yeah	2960	B
so graphic	2960	B
today it's it's really graphic they try to make it too realistic	2960	B
and	2960	B
yeah	2960	B
now he is watching Honey I Shrunk The Kids right now	2960	B
it is cute and that little Roger Rabbit on before that that is cute and they have got the He Man uh	2960	B
Masters Of The Universe the movie	2960	B
that is a real cute show	2960	B
He Man	2960	B
yeah good versus evil huh	2960	B
oh well it sounds like we have the same tapes for our kids anyway	2960	B
yeah	2960	B
uh-huh	2960	B
yeah	2960	B
yeah they do have like those parental control things on the uh remote controls you know where you can block out what channels you do not want them to watch	2960	B
uh-huh	2960	B
well my my uh stepfather and them have my stepfather my father-in-law and them have that	2960	B
and uh	2960	B
they do not have any kids but they was told how to use that but still when the kids get older they learn how to break through that parental control	2960	B
huh	2960	B
i think all you have to do is push a couple buttons	2960	B
so it's it's i'm hoping that he will grow up not really caring much for those movies because	2960	B
now we have got a lot of western tapes Josey Wells now he loves to watch Josey Wells	2960	B
yeah Clint Eastwood and like The Man From Showy River we've oh my husband likes westerns and he also likes Star Trek now Star Trek are good movies good shows	2960	B
the uh series we have got a lot of those	2960	B
uh-huh The Next Generation yeah my little boy is crazy about Captain Kirk and my little girl has Mister Spock's ears	2960	B
and i told my husband he cursed my kids they were both born with pointy ears	2960	B
not real pointy my little boy grew out of it	2960	B
no	2960	B
uh-huh	2960	B
Kirk Douglas	2960	B
oh Michael Landon	2960	B
oh now there yeah	2960	B
like Highway to Heaven	2960	B
<b_aside> here are some cookies Kyle <e_aside>	2960	B
yeah i liked Highway To Heaven and i	2960	B
and i thought that was kind of neat though but i loved Little House On The Prairie especially when Melissa Gilbert grew up she was kind of like my	2960	B
idol when i was growing up because i am twenty seven so it is you know she is about the same age as i am i wanted to be just like her because she is so cute	2960	B
yeah and well i liked it but there that is about the only uh	2960	B
show i have seen where every time they sit down at the table they pray before they eat and i thought that was real neat	2960	B
because there is not a lot of shows that do that	2960	B
and uh	2960	B
they have this little cartoon that's on Sunday mornings	2960	B
with Jot	2960	B
i remember him in school but i do not it is just this little dot with arms and feet and little eyes and his parents are there they have it like before one of the church things uh you know church that comes on	2960	B
and it is a just this little dot and he will go out and get himself into trouble and come home and the parents will tell him that there is a verse in the Bible that will help him with that and it is just	2960	B
well it's usually we go to church on Sundays but we will miss every once in a while and i will let Kyle watch that and he just well i even like Jot i mean i it is funny	2960	B
it is on channel well let us see you're in Plano	2960	B
uh it's twelve or ten down here	2960	B
oh well this is of the mornings uh around nine or ten i think it is before one of the i think it is before the First Baptist in Sherman airs i think that is the one that	2960	B
it uh comes on before but it's real cute well he's bouncing around and his name is Jot and then he has got a friend named Cat	2960	B
and i think the dog is the only one that's not a	2960	B
a dot but it is real cute and like i say they they	2960	B
teach him stuff from the Bible and i think it is just a real cute show i'm trying to get my little boy into reading uh like church books and things we have got like Noah's Ark and	2960	B
oh Lord is My Shepherd- we have got about eight or twelve books for him just little Bible stories and they're he is he is getting to where he likes them	2960	B
we got him a little Jesus doll	2960	B
uh about a year ago and he has always kept that	2960	B
he likes it	2960	B
uh-huh	2960	B
uh-huh	2960	B
so it's a uh Christian songs	2960	B
oh that sounds fun	2960	B
that's sound good- well	2960	B
yeah	2960	B
well i watch in the evening with my kids	2960	A
i have four children	2960	A
well	2960	A
yeah it keeps you busy doesn't it	2960	A
uh my children like to watch Sesame Street i watch with them every once in a while but that is not my favorite programs	2960	A
uh-huh	2960	A
uh-huh	2960	A
yeah it can be very educational there are shows that- that i like uh i like good family shows uh though uh i let my kids watch things like Little House On The Prairie	2960	A
and the Cosby Show is uh is uh kind of unrealistic as a family unless you live in upper class and have money	2960	A
i think that sometimes the things they show on there though uh the problems that their kids get into are are good to uh show that they do have problems anyway	2960	A
uh	2960	A
yeah i mean like i said real life is not that easy	2960	A
and uh	2960	A
i watch a show that i like it for entertainment uh it is called the Quantum Leap	2960	A
i watch that show every time and uh	2960	A
i i like uh	2960	A
how the how he has to help with the people that he that he becomes	2960	A
um	2960	A
because it is not a show that he just becomes these people and then he lives there for a while and then he is gone he has to do something positive to help them	2960	A
so i	2960	A
yeah yeah	2960	A
it	2960	A
me too me too	2960	A
uh-huh	2960	A
no that's not terrible i do not think that's terrible at all	2960	A
well	2960	A
uh-huh	2960	A
well i do not think it's it's healthy all the time either	2960	A
uh and my kids like to to go play with their friends and so i guess i do not mind too much when they do watch a little bit now i there are shows i do not have cable either	2960	A
and there are shows that i really put my foot down on	2960	A
if there starts to be a lot of violence i do not go for that	2960	A
i will not let them watch that if there is a lot of language or	2960	A
uh-huh	2960	A
well it you know today i watched and it is like they show bloody you know things and they show it in slow motion and	2960	A
and everything like that and before in a western or something in the in the olden days	2960	A
yeah and they were gone and and it wasn't uh not like today uh	2960	A
uh-huh	2960	A
yeah too much realism i think sometimes	2960	A
i don't	2960	A
oh that is a fun show oh i really like that one	2960	A
uh-huh	2960	A
the cartoon or the	2960	A
oh uh-huh	2960	A
that has good moral values too	2960	A
uh-huh well uh i think uh	2960	A
yeah yeah	2960	A
yeah at least we have the same ideas	2960	A
yeah language too and- language and violence and sexual you- you know things i i get kind of uh saying i am sorry kids this is and i i think it is important that i see	2960	A
what they're watching	2960	A
if	2960	A
you mean in cable oh i do not know because i do not have that but	2960	A
uh-huh	2960	A
oh do they	2960	A
they're too smart	2960	A
uh-huh	2960	A
uh-huh	2960	A
i think that is a good show too yeah uh-huh	2960	A
uh-huh	2960	A
uh i think not even the old one but the new one too i like both of those	2960	A
uh-huh	2960	A
yeah	2960	A
oh	2960	A
yeah	2960	A
oh well	2960	A
oh that is not a problem anyway but it is fun to you know seeing the show anyway uh now i like uh everything Michael- oh no not Michael Douglas um	2960	A
oh i can't think of his name	2960	A
no the the man right now who is having uh who has done	2960	A
uh Bonanza and then he did Little House On The Prairie Michael Landon there you go Michael Landon i have always liked and thought he did good shows	2960	A
uh-huh	2960	A
yeah yeah	2960	A
uh-huh	2960	A
yeah i and i liked that show because it it portrayed i thought really well uh pioneer kind of days	2960	A
you know but	2960	A
uh-huh	2960	A
yeah	2960	A
i	2960	A
now what is that	2960	A
uh-huh	2960	A
oh i have not seen that	2960	A
uh-huh	2960	A
what channel is it on	2960	A
uh-huh	2960	A
well i will look and and see yeah we go to church on Sunday about one o'clock is when our meetings start and uh	2960	A
it is in the morning	2960	A
okay	2960	A
well we'll look	2960	A
uh-huh	2960	A
uh-huh	2960	A
yeah	2960	A
well i really like now we get channel fifty five	2960	A
although we do not have cable we do get channel fifty five and that is a uh like a	2960	A
a song they sing songs on there but they're uh worship through music kind of things but they are up to date uh and some of them are like	2960	A
uh videos like music videos that go along with the songs about church and Jesus and and i	2960	A
yeah the Christian- it's called the Christian music station or something like that	2960	A
and uh i really like that uh i turn that on on Sunday mornings and i do not you know and so my kids don't uh i have an	2960	A
well	2953	B
oh my goodness now see we think of classic rock that they you know have on all the easy listening stations now as our heart and soul i mean it was	2953	B
that's a really good question because that was everything from the Rolling Stones to the Beatles i mean we were there	2953	B
yeah i was-	2953	B
well i was i was in seventh grade when the Beatles came out i fourteen years old Woodstock	2953	B
well i wanted to go i was in Chicago and i guess i was close to eighteen or something i- i it was like i think the summer between my uh	2953	B
high school and college somewhere around in there i can't quite remember the year and um	2953	B
uh yeah	2953	B
we couldn't we couldn't get it together to drive i mean you know we'd never driven outside of you know ten miles out of town at that time and here we were all hep to go to Woodstock you know	2953	B
i really do you	2953	B
it would have been incredible i- i think of um you know all the social changes that were going on around that time	2953	B
and and the sixties as being so revolutionary in a lot of ways in terms of raising people's consciousness everything from well i mean i remember we had the first Earth Day back then you know we got out of school at at uh the university and we celebrated Earth Day	2953	B
yeah planted trees and stuff and we didn't realize you know the implications of all that then and a lot of the stuff that goes on today	2953	B
well	2953	B
well you do you'll you- i mean there was- there was no name to it it was everything that was started in the sixties you had you had to fight for racial equality	2953	B
and busting themselves- it was like just a continuum you know everything sort of had a seed in the sixties and women's rights i mean things for women were totally different for you by that time	2953	B
just assume	2953	B
yeah	2953	B
yeah well we learned that from Kramer versus Kramer didn't we	2953	B
it seems unfair	2953	B
but it see men are coming into their own now too	2953	B
yeah	2953	B
well are you married and do you have children	2953	B
two kids and and how does your husband respond to all the new social um changes	2953	B
well see bless his heart you know um	2953	B
they're going to be back in style any day now	2953	B
oh	2953	B
yeah	2953	B
oh well see that that's the spirit of the sixties and whether we are talking about the rain forests i tell you you know the situation you have right now and and all of our generations is what to do with the children because both	2953	B
mother and father have to work now	2953	B
oh okay	2953	B
that's	2953	B
that's see that is your commitment you do not know what you are changing when you do something like that you don't understand the total commitment it takes to be a parent	2953	B
ah	2953	B
uh-huh	2953	B
that one person that you could always count on being there	2953	B
well	2953	B
they definitely do	2953	B
they definitely do i	2953	B
uh well see i if i had some i would i- i haven't i had an unfortunate thing happen and i'm you know and it is not going to happen that way but my my uh friends are having babies right and left so i get to see the different ways that they	2953	B
um all raise them and and one gal she started a business in her home and she she hired an au pair which is a college kid to come in and take care of her two boys while she works in the other end of the house	2953	B
and the guy lives in with her you know i mean you know it is a family sort of unit sort of thing and the	2953	B
and so	2953	B
so that is a different way and then my other girlfriend just you know tears her hair out and goes at it you know twenty four hours a day watching both kids all the time and i think there is a point where you just have to get away	2953	B
and it's good for the kid and it is good for you to develop you know your interest so you do not stop growing at the same time	2953	B
yeah	2953	B
yeah	2953	B
do you have any um do you have your mom or anybody around you that helps you	2953	B
yeah	2953	B
um-hum	2953	B
oh	2953	B
right	2953	B
well that's	2953	B
well see and and that is uh the sort of the thing of the nineties is women working out of their own home	2953	B
right	2953	B
and i think you know the more we try to you know shape that the more input we have into	2953	B
what that whole system is going to look like because that's that's our choice now too that's that's our cause	2953	B
yeah	2953	B
um-hum	2953	B
oh	2953	B
being there all the time yeah	2953	B
yeah see the the the economic situation on the whole thing and then uh well it's see we do have things that we're concerned about here this generation i don't know	2953	B
social change is always going to go on but i think we have taken a big leap in the last you know twenty thirty years and um nothing is the same	2953	B
well	2953	B
and you know just being very very politically astute about how to shape and mold the future and and um you know um did we make the right choices we do not know we will never know	2953	B
i mean you know i- i think we made a wrong choice when i look at the children of today yeah i think we made some big wrong choices and i think business got in the way i think the greed of the eighties got	2953	B
okay	2953	A
well what kind of music did you all listen to	2953	A
uh-huh	2953	A
no now well then you was in the uh	2953	A
or i am sorry i am going to make you sound like you're eighty something	2953	A
okay Woodstock	2953	A
what was yeah what was you doing during Woodstock	2953	A
um-hum	2953	A
you would have had a ball	2953	A
i- i kind of liked would have liked to have been there	2953	A
yeah	2953	A
don't you wish you'd been able to though	2953	A
oh that would have been such a great memory	2953	A
yeah	2953	A
yeah	2953	A
you went and planted a tree or something	2953	A
well	2953	A
well- growing up with	2953	A
when i grew up it just wasn't	2953	A
we did not have any causes	2953	A
to me it didn't doesn't seem like we've got	2953	A
much you know what i mean	2953	A
well i do remember demonstrations over busting	2953	A
yeah well right by the time i was born even now	2953	A
you know women's rights uh we just	2953	A
we are totally equal now there is not really a lot to fight for- now i saw something on TV last night	2953	A
on Twenty Twenty you know men uh fathers or daddies now wait a minute daddies are people too it's about a lot of men you know all right	2953	A
going through divorces the judge will usually	2953	A
uh give custody to the mother ninety seven percent of the time because_1 they go through the female and	2953	A
yeah something like that but it does seem	2953	A
you know	2953	A
yeah it really does	2953	A
yeah they are well i thought about that i thought well now men you know have to fight to be equal	2953	A
and i think that's only right though really he one guy said the judge looked at him and said well now mister so and so he says i've	2953	A
have never seen uh calves follow a bull they always follow the heifer that is why i always he said that is why i always give custody to the mama	2953	A
and he said well he said does that mean you are going to shoot them_1 if they break a leg and you know butcher them_1 if they get fat he said my kids are not cattle	2953	A
you know but that that is the way most people feel that women should get custody	2953	A
yeah i am married and i've got two kids	2953	A
my husband is not a conformist at all he is still back there in the seventies	2953	A
well i mean he is still wearing bell bottoms jeans- not bell bottoms but flared pants and	2953	A
and he well i don't like them_1 but you know to him	2953	A
yeah any day now well he just you know he is he is his own person he you know he does stay with it as far as music and stuff goes but he wears what clothes he wants to which we are both that way	2953	A
if something is out of style i don't really care if i like it i'm gonna wear it	2953	A
but uh my husband is not a conformist at all	2953	A
uh-huh	2953	A
well uh we are trying to keep away from that my husband works for the railroad we have got it real tight but i've got a four month old baby and i do not want to work i want to tend to her i want to raise my kids	2953	A
um-hum	2953	A
well	2953	A
right well when he grew up he grew up with his we both grew up with single mothers	2953	A
and my mom had six kids	2953	A
so she had to work and you know i was raised by my sisters and stuff and i can i can't see the difference but i know that it would have been better had mom been able to stay home with us	2953	A
right	2953	A
right and my husband was the same way and we just	2953	A
i want to raise my kids i do not want a day care or an aunt or anybody else raising them_1	2953	A
i want to be there to make sure that	2953	A
well they need guidance and they do need parental guidance	2953	A
twenty four hours a day	2953	A
do you stay home with yours	2953	A
uh-huh	2953	A
they raise them_1	2953	A
well but see now	2953	A
yeah	2953	A
<b_aside> okay sweetie let mommy talk <e_aside>	2953	A
well i think that's neat	2953	A
right	2953	A
um-hum well i know the family is really going through changes but now we're trying to go back to about the sixties when the parents you know when the mother was staying at home	2953	A
or that what do they call it the nuclear family yeah but uh	2953	A
um well my family's in Kentucky now my- my one of my sisters is down here her husband happened to get a job at TI they moved out here but well- his family lives here and my husband was in the service when i met him	2953	A
and so we we've been all over- <b_aside> okay Kyle <e_aside> he got a sunburn in the kitchen so i keep having to scratch his back	2953	A
the uh	2953	A
i would love to get a business going out of my home	2953	A
outside of i mean going	2953	A
yeah i'd would work at home if i could	2953	A
yeah that's the trend	2953	A
yeah they are bringing offices i mean just- i mean big businesses into their homes bringing their computers home and working from there	2953	A
well- i think for- i think one that would be uh	2953	A
it's uh	2953	A
kids could see their parents you know how hard they work	2953	A
they would understand more when uh we first moved down here i was working i was working a twelve hour shift	2953	A
it was three and four days a week	2953	A
and uh oh my little boy just	2953	A
he went wild you know i mean because	2953	A
because_1 he had been used to me	2953	A
being there all the time yeah	2953	A
and he's just now well when i got pregnant i went ahead and quit work	2953	A
and decided just to stay at home and it was costing too much at home than more at home than i was bringing in so	2953	A
uh-huh	2953	A
no it seems like it's totally different of course	2953	A
i do not have much to compare it to to me our causes don't seem as important as you all's were do you know what i mean	2953	A
you you what	2953	A
we passed them on to us	2953	A
no	2953	A
okay yeah	2953	A
well not really uh	2919	B
i uh am of an age where i could have very well served in the military during the Vietnam era and i did not	2919	B
huh do what	2919	B
i'm will be forty nine in August	2919	B
right uh	2919	B
during that time i was in college and uh and also had some minor health problems that did keep me out of the out of the military or or help to keep me out anyway	2919	B
but uh i'm not opposed to military service at all	2919	B
uh	2919	B
yeah	2919	B
um-hum	2919	B
right i guess uh uh i've had- i have had some thoughts in the past that uh this this service should not be uh performed for for areas that we don't need the service you know uh it's if it's uh	2919	B
if it's voluntary service but it's being furnished by the government it should be to take the place of things that the government's doing already	2919	B
should right	2919	B
so uh you know the the the voluntary service in the medical you know	2919	B
oh okay yeah then then then i guess that's you know uh-huh	2919	B
uh at- at any rate i guess my idea is that that	2919	B
if we're going to replace if we're going to to institute this national service policy that that service policy should replace some other area	2919	B
where we're spending money uh you know uh you know eliminate- eliminate some bureaucrats and let the let these national- this national service take care of their job	2919	B
right and uh	2919	B
right yeah	2919	B
yeah	2919	B
um-hum	2919	B
yeah	2919	B
right	2919	B
yeah i agree uh it- and and it would uh would be nice if we could get some uh some multiple use out of this you know maybe uh	2919	B
have the the military which is you know is- is- is a a a real drain financially on the country have the people that are in the military serve some other function you know instead- instead of just military uh	2919	B
right uh	2919	B
right	2919	B
yeah i have seen uh you know i'm not really that you know that familiar with it i am aware that that that Vista and uh	2919	B
um-hum	2919	B
right	2919	B
right it's well i guess uh in- in in looking at that one reason that the army corps of engineers is that uh the military schools	2919	B
do have probably among the top engineering schools in the country uh	2919	B
right	2919	B
but uh but if- if the government's going to uh to provide the service then government you know government trained people are are logical to do that uh	2919	B
um-hum	2919	B
right	2919	B
right right yeah	2919	B
well and it-	2919	B
right it	2919	B
yeah uh yeah i guess uh basically i'm you know i'm in favor of uh of the idea but	2919	B
i think that uh like you said a lot of thought needs to go into it just uh the financing and and the the uh the yeah	2919	B
but uh	2919	B
but uh you know medical service and uh aid- aid you know or or assistance for families and uh	2919	B
oh even uh even uh running the uh the prison system might be a you know	2919	B
a a an area that could run could taken- be taken care of	2919	B
right uh there's any number of things that the government's involved in	2919	B
that uh	2919	B
that this service could take care of	2919	B
yeah	2919	B
well i think that's my call waiting line ringing whoever that is -will probably call back	2919	B
um-hum	2919	B
right	2919	B
yeah	2919	B
right and uh just to see what uh what all could be done yeah it's uh nice talking to you too okay bye-bye	2919	B
have you had any thoughts on this	2919	A
um-hum	2919	A
how old are you if i can ask	2919	A
how old are you	2919	A
okay so we're about the same age	2919	A
um-hum	2919	A
um-hum	2919	A
yeah i think this is also a a broader scope i think uh they're talking about uh just service in general and um	2919	A
i i did a lot of this sort of thing in in college in the summers um i worked uh in uh Mexico doing community service for- uh for two summers while i was in college and you know it was an incredibly worthwhile experience	2919	A
so in theory i'm am favor of this but on the other hand i'm an economist	2919	A
and uh just like uh well the military has a tremendous uh you know responsibility for security and everything but there's also an equally tremendous budget	2919	A
so i guess on the other hand as as- as as good as this idea is it's got to be paid for	2919	A
uh even though it's uh you know it it's it's never quite voluntary people have to be paid if they're asked to serve for a year in any capacity	2919	A
so uh you know uh uh the idea's great where does the money come from	2919	A
and-	2919	A
um-hum	2919	A
it should it- it should or shouldn't it should um-hum	2919	A
but i don't think it was- it was voluntary i think it was just the required- year of required service there was nothing about voluntary	2919	A
that's why as an economist my my my ears perked up	2919	A
um-hum	2919	A
uh-huh	2919	A
and doing it at a less expensive rate then	2919	A
uh-huh	2919	A
of course you'll probably get another whole layer of bureaucracy running it	2919	A
so i- i- i you know on the one hand my immediate reaction to it was oh it's wonderful you know i think people do owe their country something whether it	2919	A
they serve in the military or for those who for- for one reason or other can't want to serve in another area and have talents in another area-	2919	A
great but then who pays and if they have to and they don't go into the labor- the other labor force you're losing money in terms of taxing	2919	A
from other jobs i mean so there's it's not it's not a real cut and dry	2919	A
thing	2919	A
um-hum	2919	A
um-hum um-hum	2919	A
um-hum	2919	A
and just marching around waiting for a war	2919	A
yeah uh we did have something similar to a volunteer thing with uh which was volunteer- although volunteer there was a minimum payment uh like Vista which was a domestic Peace Corps some time back	2919	A
and probably coming from Texas you may have bumped into some of that	2919	A
oh	2919	A
yeah and i know the army- what's the army has a corps of engineers	2919	A
which uh could probably be one of those areas that uh could be uh privatized or civilianized or whatever some of the areas there you know for domestic use	2919	A
um-hum	2919	A
um-hum	2919	A
but of course there are many private engineering schools that are absolutely superb	2919	A
yeah they made	2919	A
um-hum	2919	A
yeah and of course back during the depression when the government started doing things like uh CCC the Civilian Conservation Corps	2919	A
so i uh you know there's a bit of a history of people serving the government and it doesn't have to be as the military you know if you go in just as a as an enlistee uh the wage isn't anything great	2919	A
so if if you're asking for a year of service it doesn't have to be a wage comparable to the uh	2919	A
if it's a required year it doesn't have to be a wage comparable to the private sector so it could be you know a wage enough to for have someone to live on to eat and if uh if in fact	2919	A
so i guess that it a lot of thinking would have to be done if it were implemented	2919	A
um-hum	2919	A
how it's administered and how you know uh just the who uh who who would be exempted because i'm sure there would be exemptions to it	2919	A
uh	2919	A
um-hum	2919	A
um-hum or even or even doing paperwork for a police systems you know	2919	A
um-hum yeah	2919	A
homeless homeless and all	2919	A
i think they're going to cut us off	2919	A
oh oh	2919	A
yeah but i think you know in terms of the the the crime- pressing problems in the United States today that in terms of the homeless in terms of the state of the the state of the prisons	2919	A
um there're there're probably a lot of things that could be done uh on a volunteer basis so maybe they should do pilot projects to try it out to see how it works	2919	A
yeah well listen it was good talking with you	2919	A
okay bye-bye	2919	A
i don't think i've ever met anybody that thought they were paying too little taxes	2916	A
so so i assume that we're going to agree that we all pay too much taxes	2916	A
but then the question is are we getting what we pay for and and i think we don't	2916	A
i think we pay far too much for bureaucrats and pork barrel projects	2916	A
right well i lived in Texas for a long time so i was really hit hard by the nine percent California tacked on to the government's	2916	A
yeah	2916	A
i know Texas uh just raised their sales tax again because_1 uh i was visiting in Houston over Christmas with my mother and uh uh i went- bought a few things and i think your sales tax is higher than ours now	2916	A
yeah	2916	A
well i really do believe that there are huge quantities of money wasted on unnecessary- unnecessary uh bureaucracy and on just flat stupid things	2916	A
we have-	2916	A
we have uh hundreds of thousands of dollars going to uh people to supervise people who supervise people who supervise people and when it all comes out they don't do much supervising anyway	2916	A
well actually as a matter of fact that sort of research i think is worth spending some money on because the uh	2916	A
basic research really is what's made our country uh get to where it is in its ability to compete	2916	A
no	2916	A
well i you- i don't mind spending on defense for things that work but i mind having people- uh uh people spend money to create five thousand pages of documentation to order something	2916	A
this is crazy	2916	A
yeah	2916	A
exactly	2916	A
yeah i think the six hundred dollar toilet seat is probably a legitimate expenditure given what the government requires of the manufacturer the manufacturer's probably not making very much profit on that	2916	A
but the- probably five hundred dollars of that toilet seat is going to uh ridiculous kinds of of paper work and supervision	2916	A
um are are you familiar with the Grace Commission	2916	A
well i don't remember exactly when- when that started but it was back in the early eighties i think uh	2916	A
Peter Grace of WJ Grace and Company was uh appointed by i believe Reagan to um	2916	A
create a commission to investigate government purchasing and expenditures and see if there wasn't a way to save money	2916	A
and he came- uh he and his group of course he didn't do it but he got people to do it came up with a a whole book's worth	2916	A
of recommendations for making the government run more like a business and he said that you know the the kinds of things the government does even in renting space would drive a business bankrupt	2916	A
and uh people purchase things because of the rules that require them to buy certain kinds of things in certain ways	2916	A
that are totally irrational they buy more than they need or less than they need or many times as much as they need in little quantities when they ought to be able to um	2916	A
you know deal like a business and uh get things in quantity that will uh you- give them_1 a discount	2916	A
they ought to pay their bills on time one thing the government does is is stretch out the payments	2916	A
so that they end up paying penalties for things that the government could have paid for the minute it was due and taken the five percent uh credit for early payment	2916	A
it just astonishes me that we have not put more of that into practice	2916	A
and everytime-	2916	A
right	2916	A
and everytime the uh Congress changes and people move offices they redecorate the whole office they spend half a million dollars on the Speaker of the House to renovate an office that had been	2916	A
redone less than three years earlier	2916	A
and then they come up with these crazy projects to do things like spend seven hundred thousand dollars to make Lawrence Welk's birth place a shrine	2916	A
and i can think of a whole lot better things to do with seven hundred thousand dollars	2916	A
well i don't think it does much good but i write my Congressman all the time i've got a congressman who is very concerned about uh uh irrational expenses and who is a real fiscal conservative	2916	A
and and so one of the things i do is donate money to his campaigns and uh write to him when i see things that outrage me	2916	A
and uh i don't know that it's going to help any but if he got uh if if a lot of Congressmen get that kind of input from their constituents maybe they'll do a little something	2916	A
yeah	2916	A
yeah	2916	A
well i'm in favor of spending money on a strong defense but not of wasting it and some of the things that we do uh like have	2916	A
three different kinds of incompatible computer equipment for the three services it's just dumb	2916	A
there's no reason why we shouldn't have somebody take a look at uh all of the things that the various services use and make them_1 interchangeable	2916	A
oh	2916	A
oh yeah	2916	A
um-hum	2916	A
um	2916	A
well that's good but that's that's small comfort because it doesn't bring you any income until you sell it	2916	A
now we don't have uh property taxes going up as much as you all do because we had proposition thirteen that says uh once you have had your house appraised then they can only raise the taxes	2916	A
i believe it's two percent or maybe it's three percent a year uh until you sell and then it's reevaluated	2916	A
uh and that's that helps people on fixed incomes and older people who have houses that have gone up in value a lot but who don't want to move out of them_1	2916	A
well the prices are so high i don't see how they can keep going up	2916	A
yeah	2916	A
well i'm in Silicon Valley and they uh the the reason that the prices have gone up so high is that there just isn't anymore land left to build on most of the	2916	A
surrounding land is all uh in preserves of one sort or other and it can't be developed so there's very little property that hasn't already been built on	2916	A
and one of the problems our city is having is that uh with	2916	A
all of the environmental requirements and the {antidevelopment} people taking over the city council we've driven out some corporations which were paying a lot of our taxes	2916	A
and so now they're going to have to assess us because they we've driven out the businesses that were paying the freight	2916	A
yeah for instance we have the Stamford Shopping Center which was uh paying oh i think it was about a quarter of our	2916	A
uh city budget because of the sales taxes that were collected there and in this recession a lot of those businesses have had poorer receipts and so their sales taxes have dropped and we're about a million dollars below budget	2916	A
primarily because of the sales tax drop off and that uh and also Hewlett Packard was uh headquartered- headquartered here and so everything that they sold the sales taxes uh were paid-	2916	A
okay	2916	B
right	2916	B
well	2916	B
i i agree i agree	2916	B
right-	2916	B
absolutely i fortunately we don't have state income tax i know you guys do and	2916	B
and it's heading that way though	2916	B
oh gosh	2916	B
well i think in within the next few years we're going to have it here they're trying	2916	B
yes i know we're just taxed	2916	B
uh-huh	2916	B
i do too	2916	B
i do too i know there are	2916	B
yes	2916	B
you know and	2916	B
i know it or uh	2916	B
uh who cares about the sex life of a tsetse fly and why do we have to have you know	2916	B
right	2916	B
yes right	2916	B
right and you know those companies that that say they you know the	2916	B
uh seven hundred dollar six thousand dollar toilet seat in reality it probably really does cost that because of all the paper work the government requires that you have to go through to make that toilet seat to sell it to them_1 it probably does cost six thousand dollars	2916	B
yeah	2916	B
right	2916	B
uh-huh um-hum um-hum i know absolutely-	2916	B
no what is it	2916	B
uh	2916	B
um-hum	2916	B
um-hum um-hum	2916	B
right	2916	B
right	2916	B
yep	2916	B
um-hum	2916	B
right	2916	B
right	2916	B
right i know that	2916	B
i know it i know it just mind- boggles your mind when you think- think- and it's it's scary to think that these guys are up there running- running our government that that approve of all this stuff	2916	B
um-hum	2916	B
i know it isn't that sick isn't that that's our tax dollars-	2916	B
i don't either	2916	B
i know it but you know what can you do there's really i don't even- i really don't what know what we can do about it uh the ways to- other than	2916	B
responsible	2916	B
um-hum um-hum	2916	B
that's good	2916	B
uh-huh well that's good	2916	B
um-hum something be done maybe yeah that's a key is maybe i know i uh i	2916	B
donate to work we have uh a thing to you can donate but of course what we're donating our uh political party that we're donating is	2916	B
whoever is is for the defense department you know of course our defense budget that's who our money- our money goes to we really don't have any say so	2916	B
i wouldn't either	2916	B
yes yes that's dumb	2916	B
absolutely i just- what's wrong with that i	2916	B
that's right	2916	B
yeah yes i know	2916	B
i can't understand but	2916	B
i know our company- my property tax goes up all the time i'm right at DFW airport so we're we-	2916	B
we should be getting a tax break because we get all the town i live in gets all of the uh revenue from DFW because_1 it's in our city limits but	2916	B
it doesn't all it's they're just building these great big fancy homes and uh uh taxes are just going up and up but course my property- the value of my home's going up too so that doesn't hurt that's always good	2916	B
you got	2916	B
enough's enough	2916	B
that's great	2916	B
oh okay well that's a good idea	2916	B
sure	2916	B
yeah i keep reading where they say in in now Los Angeles area where the	2916	B
the property thing is just going to bust one of these days you know or and San Francisco too i think the prices- prices of real estate is so high	2916	B
no i don't and they say that it's going to come you know a lot of companies are moving out of California because they can't afford people can't afford to live there to work there so they're moving i know Silicon Valley they say is just	2916	B
oh are you	2916	B
oh	2916	B
oh okay um-hum	2916	B
oh okay	2916	B
um-hum	2916	B
yeah	2916	B
oh okay	2916	B
yeah	2916	B
now that's a shame	2916	B
uh-huh	2916	B
uh-huh	2916	B
oh okay	2916	B
um-hum	2916	B
where are you from Tina	2945	B
um-hum	2945	B
yeah uh-huh i have i have two children i have a seven year old and a three year old	2945	B
and uh so i try to spend as much time as possible with them	2945	B
well um	2945	B
we-	2945	B
we do a lot of things with them you know Taylor- Taylor my youngest is or my oldest is in school and so she has a lot of school programs and things like that	2945	B
how- was it a big change in your life to uh have a child	2945	B
uh-huh	2945	B
uh-huh	2945	B
oh uh-huh what do you do during those those days	2945	B
yeah well you said you said you worked a couple days a month though what do what do you do	2945	B
oh are you	2945	B
uh-huh	2945	B
yeah	2945	B
yeah	2945	B
yeah i understand that yeah	2945	B
they really grow up quick especially at that early age	2945	B
but my my wife was uh she worked part time when my oldest was was little and now she's staying home all the time but uh that worked out really well because it's a big transition i think to have children	2945	B
you know to go from you know nothing you know if you want to do something every night that's fine but when you have children it doesn't work that way anymore so	2945	B
yeah yeah	2945	B
yeah i agree with you i	2945	B
i i think that	2945	B
my wife leaned that way and i'm really glad she did and you know i'm glad she's staying home but you know i know there are some days when she wishes- she wishes she was back at work but	2945	B
yeah	2945	B
yeah well see that's that's why i'm glad my wife did too because_1 she worked either two to three- three days a week and that got her out of the house and yet she'd get to spend you know	2945	B
three or four days with yeah yeah and so	2945	B
yeah i do to i agree but then when you start having two of them it's you know a little bit tougher	2945	B
because you've got to make a little more money to make that payoff and stuff	2945	B
are are you from the Maryland area	2945	B
really	2945	B
um uh i'm in Dallas Texas	2945	B
yeah	2945	B
so uh i'm i've lived here like eight years or so my wife's from Fort Worth	2945	B
but	2945	B
yeah i work for Texas Instruments	2945	B
yeah that explains it doesn't it	2945	B
yeah yeah	2945	B
yeah	2945	B
what's your husband do	2945	B
uh-huh	2945	B
oh	2945	B
oh yeah i'm sure it does	2945	B
uh-huh	2945	B
yeah	2945	B
yeah what uh my wife did some teaching at like uh	2945	B
like a private tutoring place	2945	B
a Sylvan Learning Center this year and so that that got me to spend- to be able to spend more time with the kids at night and stuff you know	2945	B
because_1 normally if if they need something they just go to mom	2945	B
no matter what it is i mean i could- i'm perfectly capable of doing it for them but	2945	B
it's so much easier to go to mom i guess they get used to it	2945	B
so but you know we'd go to the library and do things like that yeah	2945	B
but	2945	B
oh yeah	2945	B
uh-huh	2945	B
yeah	2945	B
uh-huh	2945	B
yeah	2945	B
uh-huh it really does because i think you you know you grow closer was your uh was your husband i mean naturally a child i mean had- had he been around children or	2945	B
oh	2945	B
uh-huh	2945	B
yeah	2945	B
yeah	2945	B
yeah	2945	B
yeah yeah	2945	B
yeah i understand	2945	B
um you know it's it's hard because you know then	2945	B
you're not getting to spend as much time with at home i mean your husband is not getting to spend as much time at home as he'd want to	2945	B
so yeah that that's a tough situation but then then again you know some you got to do what you got to do	2945	B
you know to get along too so	2945	B
uh-huh well- well like i said my wife normally feels that way there are days when uh i come home and she says here take these kids i'm getting out	2945	B
so she's she's had about enough during those days	2945	B
but but for the most part i you know i've really feel like that's led the way that you know what just like what you said with the cost of living and everything i think a lot of people can't afford to get by on just one salary an	2945	B
and won't	2945	B
and so i think that's led- tended to lead to a decline in in families and family values especially	2945	B
and i really think that that's one of the problems the nation's facing that you know we need to do something about but i don't know what	2945	B
yeah	2945	B
yeah would would you have said that a couple of years ago	2945	B
do you think	2945	B
uh-huh	2945	B
uh-huh	2945	B
it's amazing how your whole focus on life changes after you've had a child	2945	B
uh-huh	2945	B
well you know in the next year or so you'll see so many instances where you know he'll mimic something that you've done and you see you know everything i'm doing he's learning from	2945	B
and and you think if i wasn't here he'd be learning that from a babysitter or from a day care	2945	B
you know they- that's how they're developing their patterns and i think a lot of people either don't care or don't realize it you know that's	2945	B
yeah	2945	B
yeah eventually	2945	B
yeah it's true	2945	B
yeah	2945	B
yeah plus plus i think it becomes part of you- part of you too i mean you get to stay home i mean it's not just for him but it's also for you because you're both kind of bonding together there too i think	2945	B
so	2945	B
well it's been nice talking to you	2945	B
okay good luck okay good bye	2945	B
um i'm from Maryland and um i have one son who's	2945	A
months- almost sixteen months old are are you married or	2945	A
you are	2945	A
oh	2945	A
that's good uh what kind of things do you do	2945	A
oh	2945	A
oh yeah	2945	A
um yeah it's really nice uh my husband uh um- is- is working most- you know most of the time he's working long hours but uh	2945	A
i'm staying home	2945	A
uh i'm just working a couple days a month and um	2945	A
um we- we spend a lot of time at the playground and we go to the zoo and we go and we watch-	2945	A
yeah yeah	2945	A
i'm a nurse	2945	A
so yeah so it's it's it's real easy to work out my schedule you know to uh get in to to still	2945	A
stay in with that an and to have enough time to spend with Matthew he	2945	A
he's uh just now really starting to to get interested in a lot of things so um	2945	A
yeah	2945	A
oh yeah	2945	A
that's right and i think a lot of people are um are turning to	2945	A
well i think i think a lot of people are realizing that but still there are so many people that are you know have their careers first and it's uh i think it's really hurting the	2945	A
the kids you know but	2945	A
i know	2945	A
that's why i like to to work- to work a couple days i think it's uh	2945	A
it gives me a break	2945	A
most of the time at home yeah	2945	A
uh we had started out like that and um i think that was	2945	A
really ideal uh	2945	A
it's	2945	A
yeah	2945	A
yeah yeah	2945	A
it's difficult but	2945	A
uh-huh i'm i've i've lived here forever so	2945	A
yeah i'm in i live in Germantown and uh are you where are you from	2945	A
in Dallas oh	2945	A
oh uh	2945	A
okay oh so that explains well um i don't know i uh	2945	A
we we do a lot of things on the weekends together the family but uh	2945	A
but as far as during the week it's it's usually uh you know just my son and i and we're	2945	A
uh he he works for Coca-Cola	2945	A
so he uh	2945	A
he manages a plant out here an and it takes a lot of time	2945	A
but um	2945	A
it you know we take walks and go to the library and try to fill our day with things like that but um	2945	A
oh	2945	A
oh	2945	A
yeah	2945	A
right	2945	A
that's good	2945	A
that's good i know my husband was real uh in the beginning when he uh he was transferred to a a larger plant and he um	2945	A
he works about an hour and a half away from here from our home and uh so it takes him a little bit of time and	2945	A
i'm not able to work during the week uh because of that he was i was working in the evening and he was coming home and i i could go to work but uh	2945	A
their relationship uh when i was able to work in the evenings uh really grew he you know just the time that they were spending together	2945	A
i think it it really it really helped to have that time together	2945	A
uh oh yeah he has uh he has seven other brothers and sisters and they have	2945	A
we have thirteen grand well his parents have thirteen grandchildren	2945	A
so it's uh	2945	A
you know there's a lot of kids in the family and and he really enjoys it but uh right now it's kind of a difficult time but	2945	A
and and the cost of living here is just so tremendously you know outrageous um	2945	A
it's difficult uh to do it any other way	2945	A
yeah	2945	A
that's right	2945	A
yeah	2945	A
yeah yeah at least i i just consider myself blessed that i can stay home it uh	2945	A
i know	2945	A
i know	2945	A
yeah	2945	A
yeah	2945	A
oh yeah it has	2945	A
i believe that too and i think uh	2945	A
the kids are where they need to you know they need to really focus on the children in the world- in this	2945	A
country	2945	A
no i didn't i didn't even really think about it that much i mean you know i knew- i was aware vaguely aware of it but um i didn't it wasn't really that important to me and uh	2945	A
oh it it really does i just the whole uh	2945	A
you know seeing how you really are creating- are are forming this you know the mind	2945	A
that's right	2945	A
yeah	2945	A
or or they just put it in the back of their mind and let it slide i	2945	A
i've seen a lot of people just say well you know he'll learn everything when he gets into	2945	A
uh you know	2945	A
but it um	2945	A
i i know even just this first year that i've been with uh my son here- here um he's i can just see how much	2945	A
of of a difference it makes staying home with him instead of uh	2945	A
yeah	2945	A
that's true	2945	A
yeah	2945	A
yeah	2945	A
that's true	2945	A
well it's nice talking to you too	2945	A
okay bye bye	2945	A
okay	2911	B
yes i do	2911	B
uh i'm a data manager at a manufacturing company that makes landing gear	2911	B
yes they do very good uh comparable i used to work for TI and i used to work for Martin Marietta and they are comparable to them um as good or better	2911	B
what do do you work	2911	B
oh okay	2911	B
uh-huh	2911	B
really	2911	B
well i uh my insurance is is very reasonable where i work and course the	2911	B
uh-huh	2911	B
oh is it really	2911	B
well i i chose an HMO and mine only runs five dollars a uh five dollars a month	2911	B
oh i see	2911	B
okay well i pay five dollars a month for my medical and then we have a retirement uh	2911	B
benefits package- a profit sharing type of thing they match our uh we can put in up to fifteen percent and they'll match uh sixteen six percent one hundred percent you know so that is that's better than most companies do	2911	B
plus plus they you know we have bonds we have a credit union it's a fairly it's not a real large company well it is it's part of a large company it's a subsidiary of a large company and	2911	B
we have three different- that's my call's waiting they'll just have to call back uh we have uh	2911	B
uh we're part of a	2911	B
company in we have a company in California and a company in Canada and this company here and uh so we have about five hundred employees at each place	2911	B
uh so it's that's about fifteen hundred all together then we but we're a a subsidiary of a of a larger company so we have all the benefits that all the big large companies have	2911	B
i don't know any that we don't have	2911	B
oh uh-huh	2911	B
yeah	2911	B
that's all right	2911	B
oh uh-huh	2911	B
i worked for TI for seventeen years and then i moved to Florida and worked at Martin Marietta in Orlando for four years and then i got	2911	B
i was- no i'm in Texas uh i left Martin Marietta for this company here in Fort Worth it's i'm in Grapevine right now but	2911	B
i work in Fort Worth and they just offered me such a fantastic deal i i just couldn't turn it down there wasn't any way i could turn it down they	2911	B
they moved me and they paid for every i mean they paid for everything my license my driver's license my- all my utilities at my home plus you know paying to move my furniture and	2911	B
my license tags everything i just you know and plus a huge salary increase and i thought God i'd be stupid if i don't take this and i wanted to come back to Texas anyway so	2911	B
and like i say they have all those same benefits that Martin Marietta and TI had so um	2911	B
i've	2911	B
i'm a data manager	2911	B
and it	2911	B
oh did- no this is a lot of people think that it has something to do with computers and it really doesn't- i mean i do have a computer but it it really doesn't have anything to do with computers it's	2911	B
data that uh is generated like reports test reports financial reports- all kinds of reports that	2911	B
that uh a project would generate uh now it's my job to see that	2911	B
contractually- contractually these people you know deliver them_1 on time and i have to make sure that they they do get delivered and that's that's what my job is and it's that's that kind of data instead of	2911	B
yeah uh-huh	2911	B
i was a a configuration manager at at TI which was	2911	B
similar- well it was uh similar but wasn't i mean i it was uh	2911	B
doing uh it was a little bit more technical configuration management- management it's a little bit more technical than what i'm doing now	2911	B
and i liked it but it was a	2911	B
it was a job that i always felt like i didn't have control of you know what i mean i never felt like i'd mastered that job and when i moved to Florida i moved down there as a configuration manager	2911	B
and stayed there from uh stayed at that job for quite a while until i	2911	B
got an opportunity to go into data management which i and i've been in that ever since and love it i mean that's just my cup of tea the configuration manager was	2911	B
oh i do too and i really did i'd sit there and you know when people asked me what i did i never could really tell them_1 what i did because_1 i didn't know because_1 i you know i was doing the job	2911	B
and i was getting good raises and my boss even goes you even got non periodic raises but i really just felt so control- out of control	2911	B
so but anyway i'm	2911	B
and i like i say i've always been with a company that's had a lot of benefits so uh and and- when you get older now i know when you're younger my daughter just doesn't realize it but	2911	B
i wish i had when i was younger thought about retirement but you know you think oh that's twenty years away from now who's going to worry about it well i	2911	B
that's good that's smart i wish i could talk my daughter into realizing that she works at TI also	2911	B
and she needs yeah	2911	B
no she works- at the Expressway site uh SC Building	2911	B
and	2911	B
uh	2911	B
uh-huh	2911	B
yeah	2911	B
i know isn't that a shame	2911	B
right	2911	B
see well i was uh	2911	B
forty five before i got my degree i uh started back when i was it took me nine years i was about thirty something before i even went back to school or even started college	2911	B
and i was forty five when i finally graduated	2911	B
uh-huh	2911	B
uh-huh	2911	B
oh yeah	2911	B
yeah	2911	B
really	2911	B
yeah	2911	B
um-hum	2911	B
yeah i stayed home with my kid i think i guess the longest i ever stayed home was eight years i stayed home with my kids and uh my son went ahead and graduated from college and my daughter has quite a few hours but she	2911	B
bless her she and her husband are you know kind of struggling he's a policeman	2911	B
they're both having and she works a second job too so she really doesn't have time i guess- if she wanted to make time she could but and eventually i think she'll go back when it really means something to her but right now that's not foremost and her she likes being with her little girl	2911	B
oh i know it i know it	2911	B
um-hum	2911	B
yes	2911	B
um-hum	2911	B
knowing that she was always there when we got home from school my mother was there and what i did when my kids were growing up since i had to work i worked nights i was home i was sleepy but i was home when they got home from school	2911	B
yeah	2911	B
uh-huh	2911	B
uh-huh	2911	B
school	2911	B
yeah	2911	B
oh is he	2911	B
your your husband works for the railroad you say	2911	B
oh now do- do they have pretty good benefits there besides uh	2911	B
is it	2911	B
sure oh yeah absolutely-	2911	B
uh-huh	2911	B
uh-huh	2911	B
yeah	2911	B
oh once i did	2911	B
well yeah that'll add up fast fast fast absolutely yeah you're smart in doing that i would never quit that	2911	B
well i've started uh	2911	B
that's right that i went the other day and had them_1 start taking some money out of my uh	2911	B
savings- my checking at work to- in to put into savings account plus i buy a two hundred dollar a month a bond a month so they'll- and they'll stack up faster than you realize	2911	B
uh-huh	2911	B
uh do you work	2911	A
what do you do	2911	A
oh well do they have good job benefits	2911	A
huh	2911	A
uh-huh	2911	A
no i don't	2911	A
uh i said my husband works on the railroad they've got	2911	A
a lot of benefits but it's expensive	2911	A
this uh the insurance is a kick in the tail every month	2911	A
um-hum	2911	A
it would	2911	A
well the insurance is good we only have to pay like a hundred dollar deductible per year it's just it's uh	2911	A
it's like a hundred dollars a month	2911	A
yeah well i mean well that's just	2911	A
well this is uh like retirement benefits and it's a bunch of different benefits in one it's not just	2911	A
it's not just medical insurance	2911	A
that's great	2911	A
yeah that's good	2911	A
um-hum	2911	A
whoops i'm sorry	2911	A
i'm sorry	2911	A
they do	2911	A
i don't know a lot about benefits most of the jobs that i've had you know were-	2911	A
i don't have a degree i quit college when i first got pregnant with my little boy	2911	A
i plan on going back just i want to wait for my kids to grow up now	2911	A
and uh	2911	A
uh i'm sorry so all i've had was mainly fast food jobs and i worked at a toy store and i worked at TI for a while but it was for Manpower so	2911	A
i liked working at TI	2911	A
oh you're in Florida	2911	A
oh okay	2911	A
well that's great	2911	A
what did you say you did again a computer- a data-	2911	A
huh	2911	A
well i took data processing in college	2911	A
instead of computer data well that sounds great though what did you do at TI	2911	A
right	2911	A
right	2911	A
oh i hate to feel out of control of anything	2911	A
yeah	2911	A
you played it by ear	2911	A
hum	2911	A
um-hum	2911	A
well me and my husband are we've talked about it we're having six dollars a day taken out of his check for retirement	2911	A
well that's	2911	A
at the TI in Sherman or	2911	A
okay well uh	2911	A
um that's about the only thing we're doing for retirement now when i worked i wanted to go to TI i was wanting to become a TIer that way i could get some benefits because most the jobs around here you can't get benefits	2911	A
especially if you well if you don't have a	2911	A
degree or something	2911	A
but i'll go back to school one of these days and i will get me a	2911	A
um-hum	2911	A
well i was eighteen and i went and got my GED i quit the high school i just couldn't stand it and then course i hated it two years after i quit i wish i'd never done it	2911	A
but then i i went and got my GED and i went to school and then i i loved college i was making a three point oh average i wasn't having hardly any problems- except for with my computer class i did have problems there but uh	2911	A
now i was then i was old enough to know you know well i'm paying for it i've got to	2911	A
you know do something with it but then i wanted to stay home with the babies so	2911	A
well we're having a hard time right now too but it's just who if the kid if kids don't have direction if their mother ain't home directing them through the day kids are growing up wild nowadays	2911	A
my mom had to work and i i can feel the difference um a lot of	2911	A
well my husband had somebody to push him his mother was able to stay home with him more and you know he got his life straight at an early age which i'm not a i never- i never went wild or anything but	2911	A
i still don't know what i want to be when i grow up and i'm twenty seven years old	2911	A
yeah	2911	A
um-hum	2911	A
um-hum	2911	A
yeah that's what's important isn't it you have to- while i'm when they start going to school now my baby's just three months old and i'm not having any more so	2911	A
i'm going to be there for them at least until they're in the second well until the baby starts	2911	A
preschool- uh kindergarten not preschool	2911	A
which it don't take long it seems like just yesterday that my little boy was born and he's fixing to go to school next year	2911	A
yeah they're all growing up	2911	A
yeah he sure does	2911	A
yeah their medical and dental is real good and uh like i said they do make it easy for you to that's where a lot of our money is going is toward his retirement but i want- we'll like that once you know we get older	2911	A
and we'll need it and like i said that's six dollars a day and oh i haven't really sat down and figured it out but i guess it'd be pretty easy three times six is what eighteen	2911	A
yeah so it's a hundred and eighty a month	2911	A
yeah	2911	A
no well it's it's like this we don't see it so we don't really miss it	2911	A
uh-huh	2911	A
yeah now i wish they had that bond here i know that they had that at TI for the TI-	2911	A
okay Ray what do you think about taxes	2920	A
um-hum yeah i agree	2920	A
oh really	2920	A
hum-um	2920	A
um-hum	2920	A
uh-huh yeah	2920	A
yeah	2920	A
uh-huh	2920	A
oh so you've got you have- you have a little graft and corruption huh	2920	A
yeah	2920	A
um	2920	A
yeah you know the waste you know that's i think uh	2920	A
i- i think that's a big problem uh uh i don't do you think you get some good services for your taxes do you have a good school district do you have	2920	A
um-hum	2920	A
yeah	2920	A
um-hum	2920	A
um-hum	2920	A
yeah around fifty percent	2920	A
yeah	2920	A
yeah that's that's pretty much i think nationwide it's	2920	A
you know the average is about seventy five percent uh complete school you know twenty five percent dropout rate throughout the country	2920	A
for school districts i'm not sure how they figure that out if they do per pupil or if they look at just averages per school district and things like that	2920	A
but some schools i- i don't know see i- i live in a small community and um	2920	A
we don't pay much in taxes i don't uh this sets	2920	A
this is a farming community and the farmers control your property taxes basically and and in a sense you services	2920	A
we have uh probably what's considered the third worst	2920	A
maybe the fourth worst school district in uh	2920	A
in the in the state	2920	A
other than the city of Baltimore itself probably you know which is always i guess a low is a low streak so actually i think for the return on my taxes for my for- my	2920	A
my uh state taxes that go to my school district and my services or whatever i think i get a pretty good return	2920	A
but my employment tax you know the federal i don't think i get a good federal	2920	A
return at all i think locally i think property taxes on my house were twelve hundred dollars	2920	A
and that was that included state and local taxes so that was school district and snow plowing which isn't probably anything like that you have and that included my water and sewer	2920	A
um but i didn't think that was too bad	2920	A
do you own a lot of property just a or a small lot	2920	A
um-hum	2920	A
yeah	2920	A
um-hum	2920	A
yeah	2920	A
oh do you	2920	A
see we don't do that	2920	A
um-hum	2920	A
the uh everything on top of that	2920	A
yeah see i- i	2920	A
yeah	2920	A
um-hum	2920	A
right	2920	A
yeah	2920	A
you mean you have a full-time fire department	2920	A
is that what you have now though in your town	2920	A
oh	2920	A
how many about how my goodness see that's see that's down here um being a member of we have we have a couple full-time firemen but basically	2920	A
you know they well- train the guys and they run the show and they live in the firehouse and you know and then most everybody else is volunteer	2920	A
so there's like a core of like each station has like two or four full-time then everybody else is a volunteer	2920	A
yeah	2920	A
um	2920	A
yeah oh that just federal taxes just	2920	A
more and more and more and less and less services you know	2920	A
um-hum	2920	A
right	2920	A
um-hum	2920	A
yeah such it's just out of hand i agree- you know the the whole idea like around here um	2920	A
you know after Desert Storm or whatever we have a plant here that feeds one of the military contracts that should be cut you know that they advised on cutting	2920	A
but because of Desert Storm now they said well we can't cut it so they put it back in action now granted everybody around here was happy because it keeps two or three hundred people employed	2920	A
but you know if we don't cut some of these nationwide you know some of these expenses just have to be cut if we don't need such a large army and we don't need if the military comes out and says we don't need all these planes	2920	A
then why does Congress say tough take them anyway	2920	A
you know	2920	A
yeah	2920	A
right	2920	A
um-hum	2920	A
right	2920	A
with a one thousand dollar {antitank} weapon	2920	A
yeah	2920	A
and you know a million dollars do you know how many people that would feed and clothe and get off the welfare rolls and get and keep in school and you know if we uh i just	2920	A
in some ways i just don't	2920	A
um-hum	2920	A
that's right oh i agree with you a hundred percent you know our direction has really	2920	A
you know solar energy	2920	A
uh you know there's been some recent great discoveries in solar energy surprisingly because there's there's no money invested in it	2920	A
yeah a big thing	2920	A
uh-huh	2920	A
yeah	2920	A
a flexible solar material that it can be woven over top of something it could be it could be put on the top of airplanes to help power the plane	2920	A
you know it uh it just it could be put on the top of automobiles to	2920	A
right	2920	A
uh they just keep yeah it that just	2920	A
um-hum	2920	A
yeah	2920	A
hum-um	2920	A
um-hum	2920	A
right	2920	A
and highways	2920	A
see that's a big problem we have um i'm originally from Pennsylvania and the biggest problem we have in Pennsylvania is that almost every bridge	2920	A
that in Pennsylvania was built during the Eisenhower administration	2920	A
uh within was in the City of Pittsburgh	2920	A
and there are- yeah because see they Eisenhower put through money for uh though it probably didn't affect Boston it went the- uh a highway from New Jersey west	2920	A
i'm not sure what it was but it was uh Eisenhower i guess thought that you should be able to move tanks across the country	2920	A
okay	2920	B
um	2920	B
too high obviously	2920	B
but my	2920	B
property taxes have been going up repeatedly	2920	B
uh over the last uh	2920	B
well this is going to be the seventh year in a row that they've increased	2920	B
so	2920	B
um and they're always saying if you know if they don't raise taxes then they're going to have to lay off on uh the teachers they're going to have to lay of uh firemen they're going to have to lay off the police officers	2920	B
but yet they don't talk anything about the administration about cutting back on that end of it	2920	B
they just they've they're in the middle of an expose now on	2920	B
the state and the City of Providence	2920	B
uh public works departments	2920	B
and they've had TV cameras going around uh they wait at	2920	B
some of the yards	2920	B
and they follow the trucks as they come out uh at random	2920	B
just to see what they do during the course of the day	2920	B
and there's not much that's going on i'll tell you i mean they're going to gin mills and and spending half a day in there drinking or they're going to other people's homes and doing work	2920	B
uh i think that's	2920	B
in any	2920	B
city or town i think i don't think there's any that are free from graft and corruption	2920	B
uh if they could eliminate something like that	2920	B
yeah	2920	B
um	2920	B
i thought we always did i grew up in a town it was it's a small town	2920	B
it's in Rhode Island actually i live in Rhode Island i work in Massachusetts	2920	B
um	2920	B
but	2920	B
about uh six seven months ago they had a breakdown of all school systems and	2920	B
how many children actually	2920	B
once they once they get into the school system how many actually graduate	2920	B
and i was kind of shocked at the amount of dropout in our town	2920	B
uh not quite	2920	B
but	2920	B
it was up there it was the forty percentile range	2920	B
yeah that's	2920	B
yeah	2920	B
um-hum	2920	B
yeah mine are right now they're two thousand dollars just a little over two thousand	2920	B
no uh a third of an acre	2920	B
and uh it's a colonial house that we have it's a saltbox it's uh twelve years old	2920	B
the uh	2920	B
plus the plus the personal property tax we get taxed on our automobiles	2920	B
yeah	2920	B
and then the the town also has a fire tax	2920	B
so we get a fire tax added to	2920	B
yep	2920	B
and it's the bulk of it's going for the school system	2920	B
but we had uh	2920	B
when i when i got out of school i- i went up and i worked in a	2920	B
in a missile plant up in uh Buffalo	2920	B
and up there	2920	B
they had like all our fire departments were volunteers	2920	B
they had uh the best of equipment and and the best of training a	2920	B
and it didn't really	2920	B
no full-time	2920	B
yes yes we've got all full-time fire departments	2920	B
oh okay and then you have call	2920	B
yeah	2920	B
yeah we got volunteer i mean uh we used to have volunteer up here	2920	B
and now they're all paid	2920	B
which is you know i don't know we can	2920	B
there's a lot of things that can be done uh the federal taxes are out of sight because of	2920	B
that's it they just keep	2920	B
they don't cut anything	2920	B
and it just feeds on itself and i don't think there's anything that anyone can do anymore	2920	B
it's just grown to such proportions	2920	B
oh yeah	2920	B
yeah	2920	B
well it's like the	2920	B
the tanks now everyone's after the tanks they're the you know like the the Mach One is it the Mach One Abrams	2920	B
um i don't know how much it costs let's let's round figure just say a million dollars	2920	B
now for a million dollars	2920	B
you can produce probably	2920	B
a thousand handheld {antitank} weapons	2920	B
rockets	2920	B
and you give them to a thousand peasants	2920	B
you don't even have to train them_1	2920	B
and out of one of those thousands one of them_1 is going to hit now you take out a million dollar tank with a with a	2920	B
you know	2920	B
right but they're but they're still going with the with the mechanized it's like the it's like the old days when they had the cavalry they didn't want to give up their horses to go for Jeeps or whatever they were doing then	2920	B
right	2920	B
yep	2920	B
and	2920	B
you talk to them and you talk to like the big aircraft companies and all they say well if they didn't spend the money and they didn't then they're overruns and if it didn't cost a hundred dollars for a hammer uh you would put a lot of people out of work	2920	B
but those people you put out of work you could you could	2920	B
{rechannel} their energies into making a rapid transit system in this country	2920	B
that's right	2920	B
no um in fact in fact TI just announced uh some breakthroughs in solar energy	2920	B
you know some flex	2920	B
yep	2920	B
yep	2920	B
yep	2920	B
it's being channeled into special action groups by special action groups and they just keep the taxes keep going	2920	B
just for those just for those groups and we've got like the the uh Groton Connecticut	2920	B
where they make the subs	2920	B
and we've got a division in uh in uh Quansett	2920	B
that does it that does the same thing	2920	B
so when they announced the contract up here for that latest	2920	B
uh sub i guess uh Newport News	2920	B
said they were going to sue the government because of you know blah blah this and blah blah that whatever it was but it's generating jobs up here for us but it's really it's really not if you look at the whole you know it's generating jobs for a few people	2920	B
if they channeled their energies if they go back to like when Roosevelt put put in the C C C camps and they built border ways for the reservoirs and you know highways and bridges and yeah um	2920	B
oh okay	2920	B
is that right	2920	B
was it	2920	B
was it funded by by special bonds or	2920	B
okay	2901	A
is yours	2901	A
is it is it brick or	2901	A
okay_1	2901	A
yeah our neighborhood everything is a little bit different	2901	A
i mean you they're they're all custom built homes and used in just about every other one is a different builder so every one has its own unique design and and characteristics	2901	A
um-hum	2901	A
well i've been through one of those too	2901	A
um-hum	2901	A
that's good	2901	A
Northwest Hills	2901	A
no i'm not really familiar with the area i'm i come to Austin very seldom	2901	A
that's about it	2901	A
so and and i couldn't even tell you where she lives i know she lives off Congress somewhere	2901	A
um	2901	A
but	2901	A
uh between twenty four and thirty one	2901	A
and uh	2901	A
most of them_1 are probably ninety percent brick	2901	A
and whatever little bit of wood trim and everything else	2901	A
so even up to on the second story- uh second story the brick goes all the way up there's not much siding	2901	A
yeah	2901	A
yeah we have a two story and it's uh	2901	A
i can't think- we don't have i i don't think we have more than maybe just on one side there's just a little bit of siding but not- i mean it's very little	2901	A
stained glass	2901	A
or frosted uh yeah uh-huh	2901	A
yeah uh in fact ours we have stained glass in ours	2901	A
and uh quite a few of them_1 on our street have what they call a frosted glass which is kind of like a bevelled etched glass	2901	A
yeah so uh yeah it's kind of a mixture and then we have some that are just solid wood with just a just a regular normal small window in the middle of it	2901	A
uh so there's a variety there	2901	A
it it's very very nice we we're real proud we of course we've uh we've waited a lot of years for it	2901	A
uh we moved- to- have made several moves and and been able to appreciate uh the equity	2901	A
it takes a while of course both both of us were divorced too so i know i know what that's like	2901	A
to have to step down a little bit and then then kind of build your way back up	2901	A
no i don't	2901	A
well maybe you can go back	2901	A
oh	2901	A
well of course that's the best way to do it	2901	A
don't burn any bridges	2901	A
well i you know i hope that you can uh get back into something that you want	2901	A
uh i'm an engineer	2901	A
with a defense industry- uh industry	2901	A
and uh	2901	A
i can't i can't afford to leave and i can't afford to leave the area i'm stuck with my house for a long time	2901	A
i see it's tough but uh	2901	A
you know we've of course we uh we have a daughter that's six and and we and we would like to stay in this house until she gets out of high school at least	2901	A
oh yeah and you can also a lot of times you know like in in even and and not in neighborhood- and necessarily in this neighborhood but in neighborhoods close by here there's a lot of people who have left that or had to to leave it	2901	A
and they became HUDD foreclosures	2901	A
and people are picking those up for very little so maybe you could luck into something like that and get a real nice house that way	2901	A
uh i would say probably every other one	2901	A
no i don't want one i've had one before	2901	A
uh and it's just a lot of upkeep	2901	A
and you spend a lot of time with them and then and there is there is uh quite a bit of cost involved	2901	A
chemicals water it it it and if you have it i had mine heated so the electricity- electricity well not the electricity but the gas and electricity because_1 you do have both	2901	A
was pretty high and i just uh i just don't want to go through that anymore	2901	A
no you're right	2901	A
i can imagine	2901	A
um-hum	2901	A
oh i know	2901	A
well i mean it- it- it- it especially in this neighborhood you know of course you can tell there there there's about three different major jumps	2901	A
they start here they start at about one fifty and go up to about five hundred	2901	A
and you can you can see- and and you may have one next to you that's four hundred and the other one you know down the other street will be you know one fifty	2901	A
well actually they're they're pretty much just just spaced here and there which makes it nice because you get to appreciate- you get to share some of the appreciation of everybody else's property value	2901	A
and uh like the guy just next door to us he's probably got the same square footage but he paid another- hundred- he paid about a hundred thousand more than we did	2901	A
but you ought to see his pool he paid forty five thousand dollars just for his pool	2901	A
and it's got little fountains and all kinds of stuff	2901	A
and of course i spent all my money i spent most of the money- the extra money that we had i spent it in you know we put curtains and all this stuff in and then we put uh the the landscaping did the landscaping so that there's minimal you know upkeep in the yard	2901	A
because_1 i travel a lot and i and i don't have time	2901	A
and uh and i you know have some deck in the back	2901	A
and uh you know we have like a it's not like a it's not really a gazebo but it's kind of like a little area out there where the where we have some you know table and chairs and stuff like that	2901	A
and there's just very little to mow very little upkeep you have to pull weeds out of the flower beds occasionally uh but uh what i designed- sorry	2901	A
no i was going to say when i designed this house i designed it myself	2901	A
and i took a lot of time to plan out everything i like like what- you know where my stereo where the TV so i have built in cabinets and uh you know big covered patio big game room big living area big dining room	2901	A
uh bedroom the closets you can my wife's master closet	2901	A
is probably the size of a small bedroom	2901	A
and lots and lots of shelves built in uh chest of drawers and stuff in the closets so it it's really it it we designed it to stay here for a while	2901	A
okay we're talking about houses and if they're typical for the area	2901	B
um	2901	B
well i don't live in a house i live in a duplex	2901	B
um it's typical for the area i would say uh-huh	2901	B
um it's it's stone and uh and wood it's a combination	2901	B
which is very typical for Austin	2901	B
oh	2901	B
well when you talk about that this is a really um	2901	B
i lost my house because i divorced and couldn't make the payments and long sad typical divorce story and	2901	B
well i haven't gained myself back financially yet and um we went from a four bedroom home to this two bedroom duplex and	2901	B
um i found a very nice area usually when you're talking rental property and duplexes you're not in with nicer homes	2901	B
but there are beautiful homes in the area and they are it's not like tract housing at all not a it it's a um i don't know if you're familiar with where Northwest Hills is in Austin but that's where i am	2901	B
um-hum	2901	B
just to visit your sister	2901	B
oh okay	2901	B
are- are the homes in your area what what square footage are they	2901	B
okay	2901	B
um-hum um-hum	2901	B
well that that is really nice i like that and the the maintenance is low and it always looks good	2901	B
um-hum what about the thing that i noticed- noticed and liked very much and didn't- hadn't seen at all from from the twin cities	2901	B
in Texas it's so common to have one of those pretty wooden front doors with the iron uh you know the window- the pretty window in it	2901	B
not- not stained glass but you know i i don't know what bevelled glass right or frosted is that common in your area	2901	B
oh	2901	B
um-hum that's what more more typical around- around here	2901	B
um-hum um-hum	2901	B
that it sounds like you're in a very pretty neighborhood- area	2901	B
uh-huh	2901	B
well that that was my that was my plan	2901	B
um-hum	2901	B
right do you work for TI	2901	B
i don't either i i had been working there and i i left TI to see if i could uh find something that would pay me a little better	2901	B
and that was in January and so far it hasn't proved to work out that way	2901	B
well	2901	B
i guess i'm not one to go back it's maybe maybe make another change- another step or another direction i know the day i left it was real funny one of my past bosses	2901	B
looked at me and said when i told him good-bye and i was just talking to someone seeing whether or not i couldn't hire you back	2901	B
which made me feel very nice it it was a pleasant way to leave	2901	B
absolutely	2901	B
oh no no i don't believe in that	2901	B
well thanks so much what do you do	2901	B
um-hum	2901	B
oh okay	2901	B
i understand-	2901	B
oh i understand where that's where i was from um	2901	B
i'm terrible at staying on the on the subject so if you want me to stay on it i'll try um	2901	B
that's why i'm struggling so darn- so much to uh	2901	B
i'm- i'm paying terrible rent in this duplex i can't buy in the area um	2901	B
but it i'm trying to keep my daughters in the schools they were in and so far i'm i'm managing it so that's it it means a lot yeah	2901	B
me	2901	B
um-hum	2901	B
right	2901	B
well we're definitely checking out our options uh to get back to your neighborhood- how many people how many houses in your area have pools	2901	B
oh and do you have one	2901	B
that's	2901	B
well i i understand that um just to keep the filters running keep it clean keep it warm or cool or whatever right right	2901	B
um-hum	2901	B
you don't you you don't really tend to use it as much as you anticipate you will either	2901	B
but um i have to i have to share this talking about houses in the area just this morning i had- i saw a lease- for lease sign went up in front of one of these beautiful duplexes in the area and	2901	B
i'd i had noticed it before the sign ever went up thinking oh that's really lovely and i'd love to be there and the location is great and it said four bedrooms and you know i'm living in a two bedroom with two daughters and it's horrible	2901	B
and uh then and it also had the sign on it with a swimming pool so me being the eternal optimist that i am i'm going to work saying okay i've got the number i know it's going to rent for a lot more than what i'm used to paying but	2901	B
you know with the pool and the extra bedroom it was going to be so nice maybe i can do it	2901	B
i could not believe it	2901	B
um-hum	2901	B
are they intermixed very well or does it seem to be streets- streets that are	2901	B
exactly	2901	B
wow	2901	B
oh my goodness	2901	B
yes yes	2901	B
oh that is	2901	B
that's great planning	2901	B
oh that sounds nice	2901	B
is your	2901	B
no go ahead	2901	B
um-hum um-hum	2901	B
oh that's that's kind of what i left it's not quite as wasn't quite as big as that but it was wonderful	2901	B
well that's great i hope you'll appreciate this i was just smiling as you said i designed it myself and you had already shared your name	2901	B
define everyday occurrences	2937	B
every time you use a credit card every time you log in to a computer terminal particularly where you have access to a network- to a network	2937	B
anybody can with the right kind of skill and tools	2937	B
get very much involved in those things which are on your system that you don't particularly want exposed that's why we have such security measures for our corporate information	2937	B
yeah- if you absolutely	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
that's right when was the last time that you used a credit card that they didn't ask for your driver's license as well	2937	B
really um	2937	B
well most of our checks are even printed with our address our social- even our driver's license numbers are printed on there	2937	B
because they require that	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
right but we're talking about people who are interested in invading your privacy people who have a reason to do that	2937	B
people who are interested in building data bases of information about your financial background your educational background	2937	B
uh one of the biggest fraud scams that i've heard of recently is people who have access to such information and they find out who's a widow and what she's worth and then they present themselves to her as a uh a rich suitor	2937	B
and bilk her out of anything that she has those are-	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
there are very vulnerable people though older people are very vulnerable to such things and they tend to to	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
uh	2937	B
well on the other hand how can you be savvy with so much out there today there are so many clever scams	2937	B
and and many of them_1 are computer based and they're based on information that's available	2937	B
in the public realm	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
that's right	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
that's right	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
um-hum did you have you registered for a conference recently	2937	B
okay did they ask for your fax number	2937	B
okay i registered my people for several conferences in the past six months and they'll ask for your telephone number and they'll also ask for a fax number you would think on the surface that that is for	2937	B
rapidly sending you confirmation of your registration or your hotel or something like that not at all those fax phone number lists are being sold in exactly the same way your street address numbers are sold and you now get solicitations brought over your fax	2937	B
and you don't expect it from that source therefore you're not as uh	2937	B
you know you're not as leery	2937	B
uh some some cases	2937	B
but that- it it exists is what i'm saying those avenues exist	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
i heard a story not long ago this guy saw a really attractive young woman and he said hey i'd like to know this girl more so he wrote down her license plate number	2937	B
and he called a friend in motor vehicles and got her address and her telephone number and then he called a friend that he had in the credit bureau and he got her financial standing	2937	B
okay	2937	B
from that he also got her social security number and certain social security information is	2937	B
uh a matter of is it is accessible if you know somebody in the government so before it was over with he knew that she was divorced she had two children what school they went to what her average income was he knew that she'd gotten a boat in the divorce because he was able to get those public records	2937	B
he knew all about her	2937	B
and he introduced- yeah he introduced himself to her he said i think our kids went to school together at such and such school she- i don't really remember that	2937	B
and i mean you know he was relying on her not remembering or	2937	B
or not being willing to admit that she didn't remember him and just moved right in on her	2937	B
sure	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
um-hum um-hum that's right	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
um-hum that's true i'm still getting lists from many many years ago	2937	B
or getting junk mail from a list that had to have been made years ago	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
of course	2937	B
no you can't stop them_1 from selling your lists although some of them_1 really are honorable organizations and they will say if you prefer us not to put your name on a mailing list then we will not	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
um-hum and you have to really do some research or you do not find out who is legitimate and who is not and sometimes finding out who is legitimate and who is not is more difficult than finding out public information about people	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
absolutely	2937	B
that's right	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
oh yeah you bet you bet and with computer technology now look how spooky it is for how accessible these things are	2937	B
um-hum um-hum	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
sure	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
way to go neat	2937	B
that's great	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
yeah they don't put as many of those prepaid envelopes in there anymore	2937	B
not as many as i've seen in the past	2937	B
um	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
yeah	2937	B
um that's possible i really don't understand that either but my stars some of it sometimes it's very difficult now the gasoline credit cards require your license plate number as opposed to your drivers license	2937	B
although some of them_1 have a blank on there for it they don't generally enforce using it	2937	B
um i've not seen one of those	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
um-hum	2937	B
okay Pat can you tell me uh	2937	A
what- actually they want what everyday occurrences are	2937	A
right or do you have	2937	A
yeah	2937	A
that's a point um	2937	A
actually um	2937	A
uh using credit cards the information that the person that you give it to	2937	A
has of uh available to them is very limited that's to just your name i guess um you don't have to tell where you live	2937	A
you don't have to put your phone number down	2937	A
some people uh ask you for it but you're not required to give that information	2937	A
oh very very few up here yeah yeah they just don't they don't ask for a driver's license um	2937	A
yeah see my	2937	A
yeah my checks are it's just my wife	2937	A
and my name no address	2937	A
so it's just names on the check so no one can you know i mean they can i suppose with a little leg work if they wanted to	2937	A
but the average person's not going to do that anyhow	2937	A
okay	2937	A
um	2937	A
oh okay that's yeah i	2937	A
i've read articles about that but people have to be pretty gullible um either that or or especially widows um	2937	A
old people	2937	A
right	2937	A
and and some people some of the older people today uh their husband's handled all the finances so now they find themselves left out in the cold and they're really really not savvy as far as it comes to finances- to handling their own personal affairs	2937	A
yeah	2937	A
i'm i'm still not convinced that	2937	A
they can get you if you're if you're aware first of all you never should give your your uh credit card numbers over the phone to anyone	2937	A
which is which is kind of basic	2937	A
um	2937	A
they people may generate lists are if you subscribe to a magazine i guess they sell lists of names to other people but they'll send you junk mail usually	2937	A
um and you can stop that easy enough just go to the post office and just have your name taken off	2937	A
uh yes i have	2937	A
no they did not	2937	A
right	2937	A
yeah but that's uh	2937	A
isn't doesn't corporate have a didn't they put a stop on that	2937	A
yeah right	2937	A
yes they do exist and if someone wants to really find out about you i suppose if they wanted to go to all that trouble they could	2937	A
uh	2937	A
yeah	2937	A
right	2937	A
yeah you could do that if you really wanted to	2937	A
yeah	2937	A
right yeah	2937	A
yeah	2937	A
yeah	2937	A
that's and you can do that anyone can do anything that's public record whether it's divorce or anything like that um whether you purchase a home that's all that's all public record	2937	A
um what they do with that information people are really	2937	A
um go out and do it i suppose somebody does the leg work and they and they generate a list	2937	A
um	2937	A
uh it's uh i think lists are generated from lists now	2937	A
and	2937	A
right	2937	A
yeah we had uh we've got a an account at Sears Roebuck	2937	A
and we had moved from one town to another town and they've got our address listed now with with double towns in it and i've tried and tried and tried to get it off but you just can't get it so	2937	A
since then we've gotten solicitations from other people listing both towns so i know damn well that Sears has sold their list of names out to somebody else	2937	A
but there isn't anything you can do about that	2937	A
right some of the some of the charities now will will do that if you chose choose not to have your- your name	2937	A
put on a list and i- i do that you know we have our charities that we give to and then we say yes no just don't	2937	A
because you do it and then you're on everybody's charity list	2937	A
that's right that's exactly right uh most of the funds that a lot of these organizations collect	2937	A
go to fund the organization i mean very very	2937	A
little of the funds get out to do uh anything worthwhile	2937	A
um	2937	A
it all started with the government	2937	A
the government started keeping tabs on you and whether they	2937	A
those list that Internal Revenue has whether they leak out to the public or not i'm really not sure maybe in some cases they have in the past	2937	A
uh once a list is out it's out forever	2937	A
yeah	2937	A
but the bulk of it probably	2937	A
ninety seven to ninety eight percent of all those lists are going just for solicitations um some people maybe are using them for ulterior motives i'm not really sure	2937	A
but the bulk of them_1 is and it's junk mail and you can you can you can get off those junk mail lists you just tell the post office	2937	A
so that will limit that amount of stuff	2937	A
i read uh i read and article where this this man	2937	A
uh sent- sent to everything they could possibly get and he was getting	2937	A
reams and reams of paper all kinds of periodicals and magazines and letters and notifications and what he was doing with them he was storing them up and he was using them for fuel	2937	A
during the winter time	2937	A
what i do is on all the credit card solicitations	2937	A
if they have a return envelope with it i write across the face of it no thank you your rates are too high and i mail it back to them_1	2937	A
because now they have to pay the postage so now it's costing them something to do that	2937	A
they don't	2937	A
oh up here they do well they're still doing it well it's just like up here we don't there's very very few times i've had to show my driver's license for to use a credit card	2937	A
uh and i'm not sure why	2937	A
you know why it's so prevalent down there and	2937	A
maybe it will catch up up here	2937	A
yeah we've got the	2937	A
we've got the ones you just stick your card in the pump	2937	A
yeah so whatever you whatever brand that you buy you just drive up to the pump you put your credit card in it and then it says you know please commence pumping and then when you pump then when you're through	2937	A
you put the nozzle back and it says do you want a receipt and if you can push yes if you want one and if you don't want one you push no	2937	A
uh Pennsylvania yeah	2921	B
oh are you really what part of Pittsburgh	2921	B
uh-huh	2921	B
uh Clarion County	2921	B
i live- we live out in the country	2921	B
yeah we have we have two children that live in Pittsburgh yeah	2921	B
oh oh you are do you work do you work for Texas Instruments then	2921	B
oh uh-huh no i'm just my son works for a computer- a computer uh federal company you know	2921	B
so	2921	B
yeah	2921	B
uh we have a big old farmhouse that we've you know remodeled	2921	B
it had been you know of course a farm it's a farm community and we	2921	B
ours is not a working farm	2921	B
yeah i have a garden but you know we have a garden but we don't farm	2921	B
uh-huh	2921	B
uh-huh	2921	B
uh-huh	2921	B
uh-huh	2921	B
uh-huh	2921	B
um-hum	2921	B
oh uh-huh	2921	B
uh-huh	2921	B
uh Grapevine do you know Grapevine	2921	B
yeah my brother has a home there he's trying to sell he he's living now up uh in in Maryland but uh he lived- lived in Grapevine for a long time	2921	B
um uh-huh uh-huh	2921	B
oh it's terrible	2921	B
i	2921	B
oh i'm not surprised	2921	B
uh right right right	2921	B
right	2921	B
yeah yeah it's not good	2921	B
and the people think the income is really great in some of those areas but when they sit down and look at what it costs to live	2921	B
and uh course most of the homes are you know fairly nice they're uh done up fairly nice uh	2921	B
right uh-huh right	2921	B
uh-huh	2921	B
well prices have come down on the homes the duplexes	2921	B
uh-huh	2921	B
oh my heaven	2921	B
well i know up in Connecticut the same thing happened and uh it's people are devastated because they paid so much for their home	2921	B
but we like our area it like i said it's it's an old house and everything but uh	2921	B
well we're about a hundred miles from Pittsburgh	2921	B
north	2921	B
and yeah and it's it's really not you know not that far	2921	B
Bradford's north of us	2921	B
no no	2921	B
uh-huh	2921	B
well we've been here since sixty six	2921	B
uh we have fifty acres well pardon me we have forty we gave ten to one of our children	2921	B
no not really and and towns keep creeping closer and closer you know	2921	B
uh-huh	2921	B
yeah it's ours up here we have our rural connections are real bad	2921	B
but we but we live about ten miles from probably three or four	2921	B
not large towns but you know reasonable	2921	B
uh yeah we're tired of doing it though we we don't want to do too much more	2921	B
uh oh golly i really uh we have um	2921	B
uh four rooms downstairs and a pantry and upstairs we have a bath a bath oh we have a half bath downstairs too we have a bath upstairs and one two	2921	B
three four bedrooms and a sewing room and a junk room	2921	B
and uh	2921	B
pardon	2921	B
well it really isn't too big yet we we like- a lot of people say that but um	2921	B
it's we just like it real well and	2921	B
uh-huh	2921	B
well it sounds like a good buy	2921	B
uh-huh	2921	B
oh and that makes a big difference	2921	B
uh-huh you really aren't isolated because it's the advantages is your home is far enough away that you're not bothered by being too close to people	2921	B
but yet you can have your friends uh you can have them in you can go out you uh	2921	B
you have more of a choice you're not pressed upon as bad	2921	B
uh-huh	2921	B
uh uh-huh	2921	B
uh	2921	B
uh-huh	2921	B
more luxury	2921	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2921	B
right yeah	2921	B
uh they're yeah i suppose they are now we both of our children who live there have just bought a home now	2921	B
uh in the Mount Lebanon area	2921	B
and uh the one the one boy the house they bought is completely livable they didn't have to do much to it	2921	B
the other one is uh uh has you know needs more work done it's twenty years old i think and but they have two children too and they they bought what they could afford	2921	B
uh-huh	2921	B
uh-huh	2921	B
uh-huh	2921	B
uh-huh they are beautiful homes	2921	B
uh-huh	2921	B
uh-huh	2921	B
it is it's real nice	2921	B
uh-huh	2921	B
oh my you would- you do when you move- when we first got married uh my husband works for the state and we moved once a year usually	2921	B
and then after they had to start paying to move us	2921	B
that suddenly wasn't necessary any more	2921	B
right yeah you have to stop some place yeah	2921	B
yeah	2921	B
yeah	2921	B
uh-huh	2921	B
well	2921	B
i do too i've heard too many people say i hate it here you know they buy a place and they just hate the area you-	2921	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2921	B
uh-huh	2921	B
yeah well my brother they're having trouble selling their home they	2921	B
hm	2921	B
right uh-huh	2921	B
oh yeah yeah	2921	B
uh-huh uh-huh	2921	B
oh uh-huh uh-huh	2921	B
yeah	2921	B
i i couldn't handle that	2921	B
uh-huh	2921	B
uh-huh	2921	B
i get tired uh sometimes mowing because we mow you know a good bit of ground around the house area and i do get tired of that but uh	2921	B
i don't know i don't think i'd want to change it	2921	B
uh-huh	2921	B
what part of the country are you in	2921	A
oh you are East or west i'm from Pittsburgh	2921	A
yeah	2921	A
um the South Hills area Beaver County well originally Beaver County	2921	A
and uh where are you from	2921	A
oh okay i know where that is	2921	A
yeah that's pretty out there What well	2921	A
oh okay yeah i got my brother and my whole family there i'm i'm talking to you from Dallas right now uh-huh	2921	A
no my husband does and who how about you	2921	A
place that that needed this well that's okay i guess it's an easy thing to do so you're you have a big do you have a rural house or what do you have	2921	A
oh that's a uh-huh	2921	A
those are beautiful	2921	A
uh-huh	2921	A
yeah is it a is it a working farm or is it	2921	A
more more i can understand that that's probably what i would uh	2921	A
yeah i can hear the accent now i hear the i hear the Western Pennsylvania um we live uh we lived in Minneapolis for about five years we we originally lived in Dallas and we met and got married and then	2921	A
um actually married in Pittsburgh and that's that's not what they want to hear on this call uh at any rate we came back here with my husband was transferred around uh up to Minnesota and now back to Texas with T i	2921	A
and we're leasing a uh two story town home in a section of Dallas they call North Dallas	2921	A
and it's uh near a little town called Plano well it's not little any more	2921	A
uh yes that's out near the airport that's about forty five miles from us	2921	A
it's yeah	2921	A
that's why we not sure we we're not sure we want to uh buy down here because we actually we lived up north long enough to appreciate the um Minneapolis Saint Paul is very clean you know in terms of	2921	A
and in terms of housing down here um you really have your pick but it's just everything's overpriced for the economy	2921	A
it really is i mean we're we're in a leased town home and it's uh you're probably your teeth will probably fall out figuratively speaking it's nine hundred a month	2921	A
but you know what if you if you get anything under five hundred you get into what they call high density living	2921	A
you know the big apartment complexes and and i just have no tolerance for that	2921	A
no i prefer-	2921	A
that's right	2921	A
yeah but like the town home we're in i don't know how i mean we this is it's like a duplex like a two by two they call it like in Pittsburgh and it's nice but it's i mean the girl bought it for a hundred and ten and now she can't sell it And our neighbors	2921	A
yeah i mean we'll our neighbors the attached on the other side they're very nice thank God they paid fifty eight for it	2921	A
that's how bad it i know	2921	A
that's right	2921	A
uh-huh yeah i have some friends that live in Westport and it's really really bad i mean you	2921	A
uh-huh how far where is Clarion County in relation to actually because we're considering moving to Pennsylvania	2921	A
that's not too bad that's north	2921	A
are you going up toward uh uh i'm trying to think of the name of that town that starts with an M Bradford no that's too far north	2921	A
so you're you're not that far north then okay well you're really not too bad yeah	2921	A
um was it a home that you've had for quite a few- few years or that you've	2921	A
oh then you have yeah do you have a lot of land or	2921	A
oh my well then	2921	A
there you go did you have a hard time getting used to do you feel like you live in an isolated area or	2921	A
yeah i think that that's um i can remember in Pittsburgh when this has to do with homes uh indirectly but i can remember when upper Saint Clair was out in the you know	2921	A
the rural end of Washington and now it's it's a terrible connection	2921	A
oh well that's okay um	2921	A
but but substantially- yeah substantially you know um do you like living in an older home and restoring it like that	2921	A
how big is it how many square feet do you have	2921	A
well how many rooms do you think yeah	2921	A
uh-huh	2921	A
uh-huh	2921	A
a junk room yeah i understand we have that too that's that's large if your children aren't at home any more that's large if your kids aren't at home any more	2921	A
uh-huh	2921	A
it's enough space for two people	2921	A
yeah	2921	A
oh okay	2921	A
yeah right that's okay well we've got um this- this town house is pretty big it's about eighteen hundred square feet it's got three bedrooms two and a half baths um it's really nice	2921	A
yeah it is i mean i would never buy it but leasing it is fine	2921	A
um but it's just again the the privacy you know um we had a house in Minneapolis that was on three acres and my husband was raised um on a working farm near Dayton-	2921	A
right near Dayton Ohio and he said you know he's he's slowly getting me to um not feel isolated if we move to to where there's more land	2921	A
right	2921	A
uh-huh	2921	A
that's kind of what like his parents have uh land that they retired to um about a hundred miles out of Atlanta and in Georgia and it is too far south for me but um	2921	A
um but i mean they have one of the um when they said log cabin i just laughed that they retired to but they built one of these i mean it's just beautiful	2921	A
it's like a custom you know it's not like what i would think of when i think of old log cabins you know i mean it's modern it's right right it's modern it's beautiful it's country it's you know um	2921	A
but uh i don't what else about housing except it's uh well Pittsburgh's housing economy i- i- i think it's holding it's own	2921	A
what part what sections are they in	2921	A
yeah that's nice	2921	A
great	2921	A
uh-huh	2921	A
uh-huh	2921	A
that's yeah a really good friend of mine lives in Penn Hills and they've been in their house oh probably about twelve years now and um it's it's you know they're going to start to see their return on their investment very soon um but it's a beautiful home and	2921	A
i mean my brother lives is it called Baldwin or Bebble i mean he lives all in that same area going from Mount Lebanon um it's real pretty up there it's just	2921	A
and the neighborhoods are stable you know it's uh when you come to this part of the country we've been away from Dallas long enough that you see the difference in housing	2921	A
oh my goodness	2921	A
uh-huh	2921	A
that's what it is here yeah that's why we're at a point now we've uh we're adopting and we have been married ten plus years and what happens is uh you just realize that once you get to a certain age the next house that you get we'll be staying in so	2921	A
yeah that's kind of like where we're so we're considering Pennsylvania and we're just kind of you know toying with what exactly where we want to be you know a lot of people say it doesn't matter where they live if they have a nice house and but i disagree with that i	2921	A
uh-huh	2921	A
i know and it and the economy here in Dallas i mean it it's steady but it's still not going up and i um i just refuse to buy it um if i know i'm not going to be there for at least	2921	A
five years uh you you know	2921	A
oh i'm sure yeah there i mean you can go down a street and here he told you this every other house you know if it's been foreclosed on or you know even big executives um	2921	A
it's really i mean a and and it's hard to sell the properties people from JC Penney's from New York came here about a couple of years ago	2921	A
and they thought they were getting a great deal um because they could get a five hundred thousand dollar home with they call it zero lot lines no property Jean	2921	A
and it would make you ill to see this	2921	A
i mean it would probably be like your house on uh you know a half a city block in Pittsburgh or something	2921	A
yeah i know and that's you know like i can look outside right now and look into the next unit you know it's across the way and it's landscaped and all that with azaleas but it's still it's still not that private	2921	A
yeah but you have a rider	2921	A
no and your kids have to tell you the truth um i think that if you can keep that that way you know kind of like a homestead i hate	2921	A
yes	2969	B
oh well	2969	B
i heard that the topic today was gardening and lawn care	2969	B
ooh	2969	B
oh	2969	B
you know what it seems like we are doing it here forever we bought a a large house that was completely unlandscaped i mean it it was probably- probably was	2969	B
up to your shoulder in in thistles that was all that was there and we hired a professional landscaper to do it	2969	B
and i have since then probably ripped out	2969	B
half of what he has done because it has always been incorrectly planted or the plants do not make the winter time and	2969	B
so i am kind of at this point getting a little bit broke and deciding that what we are going to do is we are just going to struggle through the rest of this year	2969	B
probably through the Fall too	2969	B
and uh	2969	B
rip up rip out all the rest of these junipers or anything that requires uh more care than i am willing to give the kids and replace it with hollies	2969	B
just two	2969	B
but they are just eighteen months apart so it seems like a lot more	2969	B
four and five	2969	B
um-hum	2969	B
oh well i have a twenty six year old stepson and i don't know if that counts	2969	B
well i did for many years so yeah	2969	B
yeah it is over with	2969	B
but back to gardening are you one of these uh	2969	B
Howard Garrett organic enthusiasts or a Neil Sperry	2969	B
nuke the lawn with chemicals	2969	B
um-hum	2969	B
um-hum	2969	B
um-hum	2969	B
um-hum	2969	B
oh yes	2969	B
but-	2969	B
all right now are you sure they are hyacinths because that is a bulb	2969	B
well you should of just ripped the whole thing out	2969	B
have you had is this the first year they have been up	2969	B
well let me tell you they do not come back very well at all maybe they will if up further north but down	2969	B
and you are not that much further north i have probably planted oh around here	2969	B
um maybe six hundred bulbs	2969	B
no i have probably have done hyacinths but i have just learned with- with doing hyacinths that if you really like them what you do is you dig the bulbs up and then you throw them away after they are done blooming	2969	B
because_1 they do not take the heat here And if they do come back next year they are going to look real puny	2969	B
yep	2969	B
about the only bloom bulb that repeats well in my area is the uh uh daffodil and some of the narcissus bulb	2969	B
they call them_1 flags	2969	B
when does it leaf when- when does it bloom	2969	B
and what color	2969	B
and you only get one of them	2969	B
you know what i bet you they are	2969	B
and i am a pretty i am a pretty good gardener because_1 i have killed a lot of things here and and planted a lot of them and i- i work on a uh landscape committee for our neighborhood	2969	B
our neighborhood is a planned development with	2969	B
i think it's seven hundred fifty five families	2969	B
but we have about sixteen acres that we have to plant	2969	B
i am going to bet you that is a lily because if it is	2969	B
and i will get uh	2969	B
is it uh what color is is yours blooming	2969	B
and what does the foliage look like does it	2969	B
oh oh oh oh i bet you those are i bet you what those things are um is a Dutch iris	2969	B
i'll bet you it is a Dutch iris	2969	B
does it does it on its little on its on the flower does it have a beard on it at all any kind of fuzzies	2969	B
i am going to bet you that that has got to be blooming this time of year it's	2969	B
well i was just going to correct myself because they would have bloomed pretty early	2969	B
well	2969	B
yeah right about after the daffodils	2969	B
okay i will bet you those are Dutch iris	2969	B
um-hum	2969	B
well	2969	B
yep	2969	B
well	2969	B
ooh	2969	B
well then it is not it is not a Dutch iris then oh gosh	2969	B
huh	2969	B
well i am not so sure that Texans really know what they've what they have got	2969	B
did you just move down here	2969	B
ooh who who who because_1 i have got a flower i have got i have probably got do do do do	2969	B
he- he- i don't know how many square feet it is a big circular driveway the whole uh perimeter bordering the house is all in Texas wildflower beds and	2969	B
i am into that and it and it looks quite formal i mean it really does it looks quite formal but it has been about three or four years of uh uh playing around with flowers to decide which ones actually grow here	2969	B
you want blue	2969	B
um-hum	2969	B
ooh blue is hard you know if you want do you want a perennial flower that will bloom all Summer	2969	B
okay put in a perennial blue salvia	2969	B
now it's going to grow about um the plant itself will grow about	2969	B
eighteen inches tall and it'll send out a flower spike you will see them blooming now it is a wildflower here but you can get them in the nursery	2969	B
yep well the you know nursery men will sell- will sell you things here and they are they are kind of in a labor of love the other thing to do if you really- really like the hyacinths and i do is that before you plant those bulbs stick them in the refrigerator for five weeks or so to cool them	2969	B
yep	2969	B
huh-uh	2969	B
um-hum	2969	B
salvia	2969	B
uh-huh	2969	B
and now that will bloom all Summer long and it will it but it insists on full sun	2969	B
uh-huh	2969	B
uh-huh	2969	B
i will tell you another plant that is purply it- it- it is dark purply kind of a purply blue red it is really a pretty plant	2969	B
it is sold down here as Purple Buddy now it's not yeah it is not a perennial it is an annual but it will take the heat down here	2969	B
Purple Buddy it's proper name is gomphrena	2969	B
G O M P H R E N A gomphrena	2969	B
and sold as Purple Buddy or sometimes sold as straw flower and they make uh oh about a foot high plant and they send out this this spike that has this purple ball on the top of it but that purple ball	2969	B
okay what you mean my voice	2969	A
oh no i am from Kentucky	2969	A
originally	2969	A
so	2969	A
uh-huh	2969	A
i know we're about to hit it here a few minutes i figured i could- make this call and get it over with we are going to mow and trim and edge	2969	A
-that's all we have been doing all weekend	2969	A
uh-huh	2969	A
um-hum	2969	A
uh how many kids do you have	2969	A
okay	2969	A
what year i mean how old are they	2969	A
four and five goodness	2969	A
i've got a four year old- a four year old and a four month old	2969	A
and an eight year old stepdaughter	2969	A
well you do not have to tend to him	2969	A
oh you did okay it is over with	2969	A
he is gone	2969	A
if i can just nuke it i'd do it but i do not i just	2969	A
it is like oh i'll get out there and pull my weeds i do not have a real big front yard	2969	A
but i do have half of it is a flower bed just about all by the porch because_1 the porch is pretty big i live in town	2969	A
but just pulling all the weeds out of that just drives me nuts i do not like it and i just went out this weekend and bought me some plants and stuff and i just	2969	A
plowed through the whole nine yards got up everything there was some plants that are just spring bloomers and i	2969	A
the leaf- when the blooms died the leaves were just horrible looking	2969	A
so i just broke all them off it was a hyacinth have you ever seen those	2969	A
oh they are pretty in the Spring but the leaves i do not like them_1 you know once	2969	A
yeah it is a bulb	2969	A
no because_1 i do like the i like the plant in the Spring i love those pink flowers they are just pretty so i just cut the leaves off and transplant and put some other plants down because_1 i want them to come back up next year	2969	A
yeah	2969	A
of hyacinths	2969	A
oh of everything	2969	A
oh they will	2969	A
hum	2969	A
okay now i have got some daffodils	2969	A
and	2969	A
we- everybody down here calls these flags	2969	A
uh the irises i guess	2969	A
um	2969	A
that is what they call them_1 down here they get uh	2969	A
just one bloom	2969	A
on the plant i do not i am not sure what they are called but i do not much	2969	A
well i think they are stopped blooming now in the spring	2969	A
it has got gay- oh they come in all different colors the blooms are on some of them is yellow purple white just all different colors	2969	A
well i mean per bulb	2969	A
you get one big flower that looks like a lily	2969	A
i don't know what they are called i have always called them_1 well i don't know what i have called them_1 but when i come down here everybody told me they are flags	2969	A
uh-huh	2969	A
uh-huh	2969	A
yeah it is some type of lily	2969	A
i have got some in the backyard that bloomed blue	2969	A
which i would not would have liked those in the front because they match my porch and stuff better and then some on the side of the house with the dusty purple color	2969	A
with little purple spots that it it'll fade into a solid purple	2969	A
green spiky leaves now it looks almost like a hyacinth only a a lot higher and it is a bulb	2969	A
Dutch irises	2969	A
uh-huh	2969	A
you know i- i really do not know	2969	A
no they're they've they're died down i am sorry they are dead now they bloom in the Spring	2969	A
yeah they bloomed in the spring	2969	A
right about the same time or after	2969	A
i would took i took and just mowed over them_1 last year	2969	A
and uh we've been i- i do not much care for them after the bloom dies they are not pretty	2969	A
and to me it just looks like a bunch of leaves but i took them out of my front yard	2969	A
and i just threw them_1 on the side intending to transplant them_1 or throw them_1 away or something	2969	A
and forgot about them_1 through the whole Winter well i went out there this Spring and they had took root right where they were on top of each other and they told me that they are the hardest things to you know	2969	A
to kill but they are real easy to grow	2969	A
does that help	2969	A
i don't i am not sure what it is they said that they are irises it is some type of iris though	2969	A
but they call them_1 flags up here or down here down here	2969	A
yeah	2969	A
i do not know what it is i'm i'm not on i am just getting into gardening this year	2969	A
uh we moved here a year ago yeah last Spring we moved in here May this house May of last year so it was really too late to do much	2969	A
oh	2969	A
well that	2969	A
well what kind of blue i am wanting blue- i want blue and purple and you know just different shades of that because_1 my my house is gray and blue looks so pretty against it	2969	A
i bought well i would like to have one that would bloom next year too that will come back up	2969	A
uh-huh	2969	A
i am looking for a pen i want to write this down because well that is where i went this year because i waited too late to really plant stuff but i did not know that these hyacinths like i said i do not know anything about plants i did not know the hyacinths- hyacinths were going to die	2969	A
yeah that is what i did with my plants i had bought these uh colossians	2969	A
celosias or whatever and they will not grow down here okay perennial	2969	A
blue	2969	A
salvia	2969	A
okay i bought me	2969	A
me oh i guess i just went and bought me just about nineteen dollars worth of little buds- buds planted uh already grown	2969	A
and it looks pretty good out there	2969	A
uh-huh	2969	A
uh-huh	2969	A
Purple Buddy	2969	A
Purple Buddy	2969	A
how do you spell that	2969	A
okay	2969	A
okay_1	2969	A
hi do- do you have lots of credit cards	2999	A
uh-huh	2999	A
um i used to have a ton of gas credit cards and now i have one or two of them_1 but i think i've even let some of them expire but i was living out of the country for a while so i wasn't using them too much and i don't drive that much but i have	2999	A
you know MasterCard and Visa and you know i have a MasterCard and an American Express now i got rid of the Visa because_1 it was getting out of hand having fifteen million cards but as long as like my	2999	A
MasterCard is um free as long as you spend about i don't know three thousand dollars a year or something like that and so i tend to buy almost all major purchases on a credit card when i have the choice	2999	A
and um i used to even use it for my grocery shopping and stuff the stores around here don't let you do it too much	2999	A
and so i don't but i was living in France and there you pay for everything by credit card but- it's not really a credit card	2999	A
it's a it- it's a debit card yeah	2999	A
and um just you know it's many times you get out of the store faster if you pay with that than if you pay with cash <b_aside> bye thanks <e_aside> um yeah because they're just so well set up with it	2999	A
right well	2999	A
yeah i- i never pay finance charges on them except when i screw up which i occasionally do	2999	A
and you know i'll forget to pay the bill by the due date or this last month i mailed the check to them on the twenty second and they didn't get it until the thirtieth and it was due the twenty fifth	2999	A
and	2999	A
yeah so i thought i and so i got hit up with a credit- uh finance charge on it which pissed me off	2999	A
because um	2999	A
you know i really did mail it in time	2999	A
but	2999	A
they have no proof of that i don't i don't want to i'll probably talk to them some more discuss it but i- i never um	2999	A
usually never pay finance charges	2999	A
i had that hassle one time and	2999	A
i that went on for months and months and months because and they eventually found the check and	2999	A
deposited it and months later they were still telling me that i owed them finance charges and um late fees and things like that and i said well i mailed you a check and you eventually did deposit it	2999	A
so you know	2999	A
i guess i don't know who the the burden of proof is on	2999	A
you know it's kind of a	2999	A
because you never do- when i pay bills i don't make a Xerox copy of it or i don't	2999	A
um	2999	A
right or i don't get a i don't mail them all a signed receipt whatever i you know at the bank	2999	A
to have a proof of when i mailed it	2999	A
and i mean you can't do that it'd be ridiculous	2999	A
right	2999	A
well you can	2999	A
right or i returned it so don't charge it yeah well that's basically what happened with us is we bought a computer and the computer um	2999	A
didn't- wasn't didn't do what	2999	A
these people said it would do we need to just put external cards in and it wouldn't do that so he brought it back to them and they're supposed to modify it	2999	A
and so i called the credit card company and said well we haven't really taken possession because it's not useful for us we can't use it	2999	A
and then they said well then don't pay it	2999	A
and then a month later i had to dispute it in writing and i was out of the country and got back and i took care of it as soon- as soon as we got the computer back and it was okay i mailed off a check but then it was too late so now they're hitting with a finance charge	2999	A
but it's sort of you know it's it's half our fault	2999	A
and so we-	2999	A
right if i'd filed the letter to dispute it and then paid it eventually it would have been okay	2999	A
so i learned that for the next time	2999	A
yeah	2999	A
uh-huh	2999	A
right yeah	2999	A
yeah	2999	A
well my husband and i both have that and i don't know what we pay for his card i pay i think i have a gold one so i think it's like seventy five dollars for me	2999	A
and i'm not quite sure what it is for him but i had really like	2999	A
there	2999	A
nowadays i'm not sure- so sure that it's worth it but um in the past there you know there are some places that only take American Express	2999	A
and then	2999	A
they don't have the credit limit because i've over done the credit limit on the other card if my husband and i both travel	2999	A
if it you know a couple of plane tickets and a little bit more and you're over the limit on the credit card	2999	A
and um	2999	A
with the American Express they say there is no limit there really is but they tell you that but then that was one advantage but that's- that's like	2999	A
i don't i think it's seventy five dollars for me and forty for him	2999	A
for a year which is a lot	2999	A
be	2999	A
yeah well we should probably get another um Visa card yeah one another one that's free because there are some like i think AT&T has one that's free if you make two purchases a year	2999	A
well so	2999	A
yeah and so that's easy enough to do and if that's true that's um it- it might be better off to have that as a second card just to have the credit	2999	A
and get rid of the American Express because it costs so much	2999	A
no	2999	A
no	2999	A
i and i don't understand- i mean i guess i do understand the mentality of people doing it but i don't understand	2999	A
yeah because people think it doesn't really cost them anything to pay i have had months where i was shocked at how much had come in because like i thought i would buy a big expense and think that it would take one or two months to process	2999	A
and sometimes it comes in right away and it's like oh well i guess i have to pay that too	2999	A
because_1 yesterday like many times i'll try- i'll buy some things towards the end of the month thinking hey i won't get that bill until the next bill not this bill and it'll come in on the next one you have to pay for it right away anyway	2999	A
but sometimes the is long like i've had things that i didn't get billed on for two or three months	2999	A
yeah	2999	A
it didn't matter because we couldn't have paid for it by check but we prefer like with the credit card you get the automatic um one year guarantee so if something breaks things like that	2999	A
you can uh return it so like the washing machine	2999	A
we bought it in October and	2999	A
you know if something goes wrong with it within the first year we've got an automatic guarantee on it besides the manufacturer's guarantee	2999	A
and somethings like that are	2999	A
right	2999	A
or if it gets stolen or if you lose it or whatever it might be and so so that's you know another advantage and then even things like airline tickets you automatically get flight insurance which um you hopefully you never use but like if your baggage- but things like if your baggage gets lost	2999	A
you get money for that	2999	A
to buy new bags and things like that	2999	A
and yeah when you rent a car you get that and sometimes you get discounts with the cards and so	2999	A
okay	2999	B
yeah we well we have quite a few but we don't really use them_1 a lot we have well we like a lot of gasoline credit cards because_1 we like to be able to stop you know when we're traveling and stuff wherever there's a station but as far as like MasterCard and Visa	2999	B
we don't use those too often	2999	B
what about you	2999	B
uh-huh	2999	B
right	2999	B
um-hum	2999	B
yeah	2999	B
oh really	2999	B
huh	2999	B
oh is it like an automatic debit or something- oh huh	2999	B
really	2999	B
yeah we use our credit cards sometimes for a big purchase but we always have the money	2999	B
set aside already to and then we just pay it off the next month we never pay we don't like to pay interest on the credit cards at all	2999	B
yeah	2999	B
gosh	2999	B
uh-huh	2999	B
yeah	2999	B
right yeah	2999	B
huh	2999	B
yeah i don't either	2999	B
no you figure you'll get your check back if you have to	2999	B
yeah	2999	B
really i like to use my card if i buy something through the mail which i don't do real often or something from out of state you know where if something's wrong	2999	B
you don't want to end up having to pay for it a couple times i've had to write big credit card companies and say you know i didn't really get this or	2999	B
i don't know what this is	2999	B
yeah	2999	B
uh-huh	2999	B
uh-huh	2999	B
oh	2999	B
yeah since it well- yeah if you filed that letter with them then they'll kind of	2999	B
yeah	2999	B
i'm like you too about the yearly fees i don't uh i don't like to pay the yearly fee for a card right now both the MasterCard and the Visa we don't have to pay a yearly fee on and	2999	B
since we don't pay the interest it doesn't really matter what the interest rate	2999	B
is to us as long as we don't have to pay that yearly fee now we had American Express cards	2999	B
and	2999	B
my husband had always had that before we got married and those got so high we finally decided	2999	B
for him and me both to have a card it was like ninety dollars or something i think i can't remember but we decided let that one go and	2999	B
uh-huh	2999	B
yeah	2999	B
um-hum	2999	B
yeah	2999	B
yeah	2999	B
uh-huh	2999	B
yeah	2999	B
but yeah like you said if you really if you need that extra for charging tickets and stuff	2999	B
it's more worth it	2999	B
uh-huh	2999	B
oh	2999	B
yeah that wouldn't be too hard to do	2999	B
yeah	2999	B
have you ever run into problems of charging up more than you meant to and having to be stuck with that we've never had that problem either	2999	B
um-hum	2999	B
yeah	2999	B
right	2999	B
yeah	2999	B
yeah i guess it depends on whoever you buy it from how fast they turn them in or something lot of places have	2999	B
those- i guess they're called those pointed sale terminals where it's like it goes in the minute you charge it yeah	2999	B
oh	2999	B
oh gosh	2999	B
yeah that's nice	2999	B
right	2999	B
yeah i like that feature and the insurance- like if you break it yourself even you know if you buy something that's breakable	2999	B
yeah	2999	B
oh really	2999	B
oh i didn't know that	2999	B
so what do you think of our trial system	2924	A
yeah	2924	A
yeah i have noticed that that that	2924	A
that kind of stuff does seem to happen quite a bit um	2924	A
yeah i don't i don't i don't even know what to do about that sort of thing	2924	A
yeah i think trial by jury is very good i actually they said i think the tape said something about changing uh	2924	A
changing it such that that or leaving sentencing up to the judge only i think that's actually good idea	2924	A
well just just sentencing not the trial itself	2924	A
um because i think that that- that that judges are probably more informed as to what is	2924	A
how serious the nature of the crime is and stuff like that and-	2924	A
right	2924	A
right so he'll be able to give them the maximum sentence in some cases there	2924	A
oh yeah they- they- they give that as as an example of something that	2924	A
that might happen	2924	A
oh yes	2924	A
right right	2924	A
or just you know there are two people who say well he just looks guilty um	2924	A
that's actually that's a wonderful way to get off jury duty you know	2924	A
someone says to you you know when they ask you if you uh if you want to be on you know when you're called- called for duty say oh yeah i want to be on jury duty because i can spot a guilty person a mile a way	2924	A
they quickly let you off jury duty i hear um	2924	A
oh yeah that that that that that's that's the way it works there um anyway i think that probably for for having it what about you know about being unanimous	2924	A
i mean that's sort of a strange case because_1 i wonder what happens when eleven people thinks someone's guilty and one person doesn't one person thinks that that they're not guilty and they can't decide for hours unless they convince that one person you know	2924	A
i believe it does have to be unanimous actually	2924	A
yeah i think they either have a retrial eventually or or they call it a mistrial or something i haven't been to law school so	2924	A
so i don't know much about that i just know that um i wonder because_1 sometimes i think about it actually i think well what if i were that one person and i was completely convinced that that that that this person wasn't guilty you know	2924	A
right uh but i mean what if eleven other people are saying one thing you know and you're you're the one person saying the other thing	2924	A
you know would you give in	2924	A
yeah saying	2924	A
yeah	2924	A
yeah	2924	A
i wonder about those things you know or even if it's you know i i- guess if they were to say well it doesn't have to be unanimous what's the cut off number seven five you know six six you know how do you decide	2924	A
is it you know how do you decide what number of people have to say that	2924	A
yeah	2924	A
yeah i've never quite understood that um	2924	A
okay	2924	A
right and they can't do anything about it	2924	A
yeah i often wonder about that i wonder if	2924	A
if maybe you know i- i- i don't i don't i don't know the law on that but if they have new evidence can they can they try- retry or can they you know bring you back	2924	A
oh actually that's true i've seen the same thing on LA Law as well	2924	A
yeah well- so i wonder- and then i wonder why that you know there there must be some sort of deep seeded reason for that you you know something like	2924	A
something like well you can't be tried for the same trial because that would bias the the the the the the jury or something or you know	2924	A
yeah	2924	A
in in of the defense in advance	2924	A
yeah well well there's also the issue of for instance you can't um	2924	A
you can't uh very often you can't um	2924	A
when someone is is on trial for something you can't bring up prior convictions	2924	A
which	2924	A
right that's completely beyond me i mean that's just-	2924	A
i wonder yeah-	2924	A
yeah i mean if this man is is is accused of raping someone then i think that something like sex you know the fact that he sexually- sexually assaulted someone is a crucial bit of evidence	2924	A
that adds to the fact and i- i- i	2924	A
i- i often i never understand you know having again having i'm sure there are some deep seated reasons you know to i mean often times i wonder about rules like this and i'm sure that that that there are some reasons	2924	A
for good	2924	A
right	2924	A
then right then then	2924	A
then they should be closed yeah i mean that's what i think but i don't um	2924	A
but i don't quite understand	2924	A
do i vote	2924	A
oh yeah i vote yes	2924	A
yeah	2924	A
oh yeah	2924	A
well that's that's that that's very true but then again often- often times they don't as well often times they don't uh they just go you know they're you've got people like who are uh	2924	A
who are you know lame lame ducks and they sort of don't care about anything and just want to go ahead and	2924	A
that's true that's true i often i mean that that like you say that's another discussion but i have had that discussion before as well where you weren't i- i wonder about the politics- politics of it all so	2924	A
yeah	2924	A
well even in the courts you well well they're all appointed	2924	A
i mean that's even another- another issue you know should should should judges be appointed you know and or or um often times i look at friends we had uh a serial killer around here who killed eleven women	2924	A
choking- oh and and choking them yeah uh his name is Arthur Shotcross	2924	A
i'm not sure if they had one yet but i'm sure they will um because he was he was on some sort of news special though he was	2924	A
he was uh	2924	A
he killed because_1 he was just on trial like maybe a year ago	2924	A
um he was strangling some of them	2924	A
oh no usually they were prostitutes actually	2924	A
because_1 he was he was actually this is a very sad case the man was let out he was in prison for um sexually assaulting two children	2924	A
right he he they let him out and then and then he wasn't- he wasn't allowed back in the town where he had done this so he came to our he came to Rochester instead and they they they realized later he he'd killed about between eleven and twelve women at least	2924	A
and	2924	A
oh really way up north here huh	2924	A
oh okay still way up north sort of um	2924	A
yeah	2924	A
won't get out exactly yeah this- this this man was sentenced to i think like three life times	2924	A
but he was you know it was just horrible because um	2924	A
his his his trial was you know was it was- it was televised and this and that and what they were pleading was um they were pleading insanity	2924	A
i mean it's clear to me the man is insane and should just be locked up for life	2924	A
right i mean i don't know what you do with them at that point if you're that crazy but what what struck me is you know they had a psychiatrist testifying for hours and hours	2924	A
and by the end i realized that you know maybe it would have been better if they had	2924	A
it wouldn't have been a jury of his peers but if they had a jury of psychiatrists instead	2924	A
to sort look at it you know i mean i don't think it's feasible but it would be an interesting thought if you're	2924	A
no or right right exactly but give them a bunch of psychotics but at least have a have a have a bunch of psychiatrists you know just sort of look at him and decide from then i mean there was the issue of	2924	A
what's that yeah they did	2924	A
they had a regular trial by jury for him and and	2924	A
huh	2924	B
i don't really know what to think about it	2924	B
but i do know that they're not	2924	B
you know they'll give somebody twenty five years and they'll serve what eight months	2924	B
have you noticed that	2924	B
uh-huh	2924	B
and uh	2924	B
but i think trial by jury is it's a lot better than leaving it up to one person	2924	B
so it	2924	B
leaving it up to the judge	2924	B
oh okay	2924	B
yeah well right because	2924	B
the general public doesn't know that if if- if they're sentenced to life that they won't serve life of course the judge will know when he'll be up for parole and all that so yeah	2924	B
okay	2924	B
i must not have understood the whole thing because_1 i didn't hear them say that but yeah	2924	B
uh-huh	2924	B
but i think if	2924	B
the entire trial was left to one person i've got a four year old that you can hear but um	2924	B
i don't know you people- too many people can take vendettas out on people	2924	B
and everything	2924	B
right but that's true	2924	B
yeah	2924	B
right because they they know that you're biased	2924	B
does it have to be unanimous	2924	B
well then they consider it a hung jury i guess- i think and then they uh	2924	B
have a retrial or do they	2924	B
uh-huh	2924	B
no me neither	2924	B
well you don't have to be really convinced that he's guilty it's just if they can't prove he's guilty because	2924	B
yeah	2924	B
i would hate to be that person because you would be uh	2924	B
you know bombarded by all the other eleven jurors	2924	B
to you know just say he's guilty so we can get out of here and go home	2924	B
yeah	2924	B
um-hum	2924	B
i know it's too bad one of us don't have some knowledge on this huh	2924	B
but but um	2924	B
i don't	2924	B
so i just hope if i ever go to court that they all	2924	B
unanimous on not guilty well you've seen like these TV movies <b_aside> Kyle i'm talking hush <e_aside> but uh	2924	B
well how they'll you know the through the whole movie you think this person's i don't know but one thing that i thought was pretty weird is how somebody can't be trialed tried tried- uh excuse me twice for the same crime	2924	B
well i just think it's it's weird because i've saw well of course soap operas i'm an soap opera fanatic this one guy had uh framed himself to make it where- which he really did kill the person but then he	2924	B
set it up where it looked like somebody was trying to frame him and he was on trial for it and then you know it came out that he was being framed so then he was found not guilty and then just- directly after the trial they found out he really was guilty and he couldn't be tried again	2924	B
yeah because-	2924	B
no i don't think they can you know i saw it on LA Law too	2924	B
yeah about that woman	2924	B
yes but yes	2924	B
right and i'm sure that you know it's the lawyers	2924	B
uh after the uh defendant defending	2924	B
oh the defendant's lawyer and the prosecuting attorney i'm sure the prosecuting attorney could make a real good case if he you know knew all the details of the defendant's you know case	2924	B
right like if they're on trial- uh trial for rape you can't have any you can't bring up the sexual assaults and stuff or whatever	2924	B
yeah i know if it's related if it's related to the crime they should be able to	2924	B
yeah	2924	B
right yeah	2924	B
but they're not allowed to do that	2924	B
well that one does seem that one does seem out of it though	2924	B
because it's it	2924	B
well you're allowed to show their character do you know what i mean and if it shows that their character's you know	2924	B
capable of lesser assaults like that and stuff	2924	B
right that- that lead- led to that	2924	B
tell you what we need to do is go into law and then we'll be able to or vote do you vote yeah do you vote	2924	B
okay we you'll help out a little bit	2924	B
putting the right people in the office that's a lot to do with it too a lot uh a lot of the politics will pass laws and stuff that the um general public wants so they'll be revoted and all that	2924	B
right	2924	B
right	2924	B
right they sit on the fence so	2924	B
well	2924	B
oh i talked about this the other day	2924	B
they won't say yes and they won't say no to just certain issues just because they don't know what the public wants or the public's split on it	2924	B
yeah	2924	B
right because most of it is politics even in the courts	2924	B
right	2924	B
uh-huh now was that the um green some guy that was attacking women jogging	2924	B
no	2924	B
well did they have a T V movie about him	2924	B
well well how was he killing the women	2924	B
were they jogging on a	2924	B
oh okay	2924	B
oh see that's what i mean then they let them out and then they're able to do it again	2924	B
i think my sister is married to a guy from Rochester	2924	B
yeah	2924	B
yeah way up north- well uh i'm originally from Kentucky	2924	B
so yeah i i'm i was up north too but uh that's one of the reasons i think judges should be the ones to sentence people because they do know you know if you sentence them to three life times then they probably won't get out on parole	2924	B
uh-huh	2924	B
well of course but they need to do something with him he needs to be annihilated	2924	B
yeah	2924	B
well it's supposed to be a jury of your peers they couldn't have a a bunch of psychotics up there	2924	B
uh-huh	2924	B
did they have a trial by jury for him	2924	B
huh well	2924	B
well uh i have two children so i don't have a whole lot of spare time right now one of the things that i've made time for is uh playing softball	2952	B
i really enjoy i enjoy softball but i enjoy all kind of sports i enjoy watching and participating i really like water sports like swimming and skiing but i don't get to do that too often	2952	B
and then i i really enjoy sewing but i don't get much of a chance to just really sit down and do much sewing how about_1 you	2952	B
uh-huh	2952	B
i know it it is do you work full time	2952	B
part-time	2952	B
oh	2952	B
right yeah that definitely takes over your time	2952	B
is this going to be your first	2952	B
oh	2952	B
uh-huh	2952	B
yeah	2952	B
right well that's	2952	B
it sure is fun to do that kind of thing because_1 then you've got something to show for it	2952	B
yeah that's neat	2952	B
yeah i do too	2952	B
yeah	2952	B
yeah	2952	B
well since i've had kids it's kind of funny i i never really was much of a garage sale shopper -until i had kids but you'll probably find after your children get bigger	2952	B
uh like when they want things like tricycles toys things that cost quite a lot in the store you can find that kind of stuff at garage sales for just a few dollars and	2952	B
yeah oh you can just get all kinds of things and kids especially clothes and toys they just don't use them_1 and wear them_1 you know for that many years or anything	2952	B
so i'm i've become a garage sale shopper and it is fun on the weekends i drive around look to see you know who's selling what and i found my little daughter some tap shoes for her tap class and	2952	B
just you know all kinds of things like that that you'd probably pay thirty dollars for and i got them_1 for two dollars yeah so	2952	B
yeah	2952	B
yeah it is it- it does take more time but i don't work so uh that's something i've decided i'm going to make sure my kids have a have a happy growing up years and	2952	B
yeah well	2952	B
well that's good i'm glad	2952	B
yeah well at first when you first have a baby you uh seems to take every moment of your time partly because_1 you're not used to you know juggling your time around like that but	2952	B
eventually the you'll you'll be doing lots of stuff so	2952	B
but i think my husband is real into sports too he plays on a TI softball team and a church softball team and by the time he plays two games a week and i play a a game a week we go to lots of softball	2952	B
but the kids enjoy going because_1 there's usually a lot of other kids for them to play with and we that's getting outside and you know doing things they like to do too so	2952	B
yeah and one other thing we're doing this year is uh we bought Wet and Wild passes	2952	B
we've never done that before but the kids are always wanting to play in the water and uh like you said unless you have a pool in your backyard or access to a good place to play it's kind of hard	2952	B
and uh they have real good kiddie areas uh at both of the Wet and Wilds around here so we're planning on going two or three times a week	2952	B
yeah i think it will yeah because_1 my oldest daughter's in school and she gets bored real fast when she's home with nothing to do	2952	B
so i think that'll be a lot of fun	2952	B
so we're looking forward to that	2952	B
well when i got married i thought it was going to be fun but my husband and i both i think consider it a chore it's our yard has had so many problems it's completely died out two times	2952	B
and uh we've had to start all over trying to plant grass and so it's become a chore do you and your husband like to work in the yard	2952	B
yeah	2952	B
uh-huh	2952	B
yeah	2952	B
yeah	2952	B
yeah	2952	B
yeah that's true	2952	B
yeah well that's how sewing i love to sew and uh i wish i had more time to do it but sometimes i'll get started on a project and then finishing it is more of a chore than	2952	B
yeah another thing i enjoy doing is cooking i i like especially it's real strange but i like to cook for other people like i have a friend that's uh pregnant but she can't get up and walk around right now	2952	B
so i enjoy you know cooking things to take over to her house or	2952	B
yeah it and it's fun for me to do that it's it's something i enjoy doing it's funny though it's like i don't really want to cook for us it's kind of like when you're a kid and and someone else's house was fun to clean but you didn't want to do your own	2952	B
yeah	2952	B
oh yeah	2952	B
yeah when you're home it's it makes a difference it sure does	2952	B
well do you guys go camping or anything like that	2952	B
um-hum	2952	B
yeah	2952	B
well that's something we're plan on doing not this weekend but the next my parents go camping a lot	2952	B
and they invited the kids and my husband and me to go with them_1 and	2952	B
yeah we're really looking forward to it the girls love it they've been a couple of times and uh just getting to be outside you know all the time and sleep in a tent and that's really fun to them so	2952	B
we're looking forward to that	2952	B
yeah i think so	2952	B
yeah my uh my husband loves to fish i'm not much into fishing but uh my daughter thinks she wants to learn how to fish so i think it'll be real good for them they can go fishing	2952	B
uh-huh	2952	B
uh-huh	2952	B
yeah	2952	B
yeah yeah	2952	B
oh i know yeah um she's really looking forward i'm hoping that's another thing though when sometimes your uh	2952	B
hobbies can interfere with each other because_1 my husband's afraid he's going to have a softball tournament that weekend and i'm saying no no yeah if you're doing a lot of things sometimes you have conflicts and you have to decide what you enjoy the most so	2952	B
well not really right now i keep thinking when the kids get bigger and i have a little more time uh i might take up there's i'd love to cross-stitch i think cross-stitching's so pretty but i have never done any	2952	B
yeah	2952	B
yeah	2952	B
yeah i i crocheted when i was younger it's funny when i was in high school i made a blanket and	2952	B
but you know i can't even remember how i did it it's been so long since i did it but	2952	B
but	2952	B
uh-huh	2952	B
oh yeah	2952	B
yeah well i did the same thing uh when i was pregnant with my first daughter i was really bored and i bought one of those latch hook rug kits	2952	B
oh it was a real pretty rug and i thought well i could use this as a gift or something you know and oh it was so it's beautiful but i did not realize how long it took and i got about three- two thirds of it done	2952	B
and then i just i had the baby and then it was just like i forgot all about it and every once in a while i'll be digging through the closet and i'll find that thing and i'll think oh maybe i ought to get the rest of that out you know and finish it	2952	B
but uh for a while there latch hook rugs were a real big uh hobby it seemed like people did them_1 a lot uh uh people don't do that much anymore so it was something easy i could do	2952	B
yeah	2952	B
yeah you too	2952	B
oh thank you and thanks for calling bye-bye	2952	B
okay what kind of things do you like to do in your spare time	2952	A
um-hum	2952	A
uh-huh	2952	A
yeah	2952	A
oh i uh like sports type things too we like to get out and walk and we like the water sports too but like you it's unless you have a pool in your backyard it's kind of hard to get to do that	2952	A
very often	2952	A
yeah well part-time we're going to have a baby in July so part of my big hobby has been trying to put together a nursery and all that kind of stuff lately but	2952	A
yeah it does i've been	2952	A
yes uh-huh i've been doing some cross-stitch for something i wanted to put in the nursery so i haven't done that in years but i've kind of enjoyed that but it's just hard to find the time to sit there and do it and	2952	A
right yeah	2952	A
and i guess i kind of consider shopping a hobby	2952	A
i just go out just to just to enjoy it and not really spend money sometimes just look	2952	A
yeah yeah we bought some baby clothes yeah last weekend at a garage sale	2952	A
yeah	2952	A
uh-huh	2952	A
oh	2952	A
wow yeah	2952	A
yeah it kind of a hobby it that's time consuming too really to find the things you want sometimes you have to stop a lot of places	2952	A
right yeah i think that's important too i'm not going to work after the baby comes	2952	A
so i guess hopefully i'll have time for more hobbies i do not know	2952	A
right	2952	A
yes	2952	A
wow yeah	2952	A
yeah so that's good a whole family- your whole family can enjoy those hobbies	2952	A
oh	2952	A
oh wow that'll make the summer go by in a hurry keep the kids busy	2952	A
right	2952	A
yeah	2952	A
yeah um	2952	A
do you consider yard work a hobby at all or is that just a chore	2952	A
uh-huh	2952	A
yeah	2952	A
oh no	2952	A
oh well we like it once in a while but not as often as we have to do it i like to put flowers out and you know a few little things like that but as far as mowing every week and finding time to get all that stuff done it gets to be a chore	2952	A
fun	2952	A
yeah if it doesn't go quite right	2952	A
oh no	2952	A
oh that's nice	2952	A
yeah your how funny i think i'll enjoy cooking more when i'm not working when i don't get home -until five thirty or six and i have to cook and clean up it's it's not fun but i think i'll like it better	2952	A
yeah	2952	A
uh yeah we've done a little bit of camping we like that it's there again it's just so hard to find time to get away for a whole weekend	2952	A
oh that sounds fun	2952	A
yeah	2952	A
well that sounds nice i i think that'll be a good family thing	2952	A
to start doing more often if	2952	A
uh-huh	2952	A
yeah we've camped with some friends who have young children and uh if you can find some place where those little sunfish are right around the shore where they can just pull in a lot	2952	A
oh they have so much fun doing that and they think they're really great fishermen because_1 they're catching so many	2952	A
oh yeah skip this tournament	2952	A
right yeah do you do any other crafts or anything besides just sewing	2952	A
it's not too hard it's i don't think it's as hard as like knitting or crochet or something like that	2952	A
uh yeah	2952	A
picked it back up again and now i can't remember anything about it	2952	A
oh uh-huh	2952	A
yeah forget it	2952	A
yeah	2952	A
yeah i remember that yeah	2952	A
yeah yeah they are pretty easy	2952	A
well it's been real good talking to you and i hope you enjoy your camping trip	2952	A
um-hum bye	2952	A
oh i know the remote control was a great big box that was connected to the back of the TV	2979	B
yeah	2979	B
um-hum	2979	B
yeah you got to well let's see you i guess you grew up in the you were a teenager in the seventies right okay did you go to like Woodstock and all that	2979	B
no like that one little girl that wrote who did she write	2979	B
oh i think she was in some kind of a airplane crash	2979	B
seem like it was an eleven year old girl wrote Gorbachev- Gorbachev or Noriega or someone	2979	B
i thought that was a lot	2979	B
uh-huh	2979	B
uh-huh but it's just not safe anymore	2979	B
hum-um	2979	B
um-hum	2979	B
uh-huh	2979	B
how-	2979	B
well how old are your kids	2979	B
okay_1	2979	B
right well we used to ride around	2979	B
well i guess it would be a city block	2979	B
my mom didn't mind i wouldn't dream of letting my little boy take off	2979	B
um-hum	2979	B
um-hum	2979	B
hum-um	2979	B
well no but back even when i was growing up it wasn't	2979	B
drugs wasn't as now drugs was pretty bad but they weren't near as bad as they are now	2979	B
and this	2979	B
child abuse wasn't as bad as it is now either	2979	B
and there's uh so many missing kids	2979	B
uh-huh	2979	B
well	2979	B
yeah that is because	2979	B
even in my time smoking was just cool	2979	B
all the cool people did it	2979	B
went outside but	2979	B
my stepdaughter's getting like that	2979	B
and that's pretty hard because her granny smokes and	2979	B
we smoke so it	2979	B
oh yeah have a smoke free	2979	B
really	2979	B
yeah they do it's what about_1 two dollars a pack now	2979	B
well who is the major enemy now	2979	B
i don't when i was growing up i was scared of Red China	2979	B
now everybody told me that they had the biggest Army in the world which i guess they still do because-	2979	B
yeah because_1 China's real densely populated unless they	2979	B
yeah	2979	B
hm	2979	B
yeah	2979	B
oh i don't think anybody was prepared for this last war-	2979	B
some of the the more recent uh changes that i've noticed in society is i guess over the last ten to twenty years or maybe the	2979	A
technological advances you know ten to twenty years ago there wasn't a VCR in every home and there wasn't uh	2979	A
some- some of the	2979	A
uh that's true yeah and the old remote controls that were all by sound and you could drop a coin or clang some dishes and turn off the TV or change channels and all the things that have changed over the years	2979	A
but along with that i unfortunately i guess there's been a down side to a lot of that stuff i mean another three or four years you're going to have a land fill full of VCR's that and the parts and things that don't work and	2979	A
a lot of those things just don't go away and uh i guess the environmentalists have done their jobs that ten to twenty years ago i didn't think of it that much i knew about all the the uh	2979	A
organizations that tried to do that for a living you know let you know what what environmental impact was but just kind of recently uh the world's waking up to that so that's a change that's come along	2979	A
yeah yeah	2979	A
no no never got around as it were but i uh i paid attention to it all being there so that that has changed people are uh i think the	2979	A
the outspoken people people who make a difference and make a change that age has come down it seems like uh you can make a difference at a younger age these days you don't have to be a an older part of the establishment to make waves	2979	A
oh yeah yeah	2979	A
it's true they can uh they can make quite a difference at no matter what the age nowadays	2979	A
plus there seems to be uh uh there's a few negative changes that have come along i was just thinking last night how different uh my kids' childhood is from uh	2979	A
when i grew up i i was allowed pretty much a free rein around my house to ride my bike uh you know all several blocks away even at the age of of ten or eleven years old i could ride	2979	A
a couple of miles away i'd ride to school you know and it was it was right at two miles away from the house	2979	A
whereas here uh yeah i won't let them_1 go you know more than a block out of my sight there i'm- just a little too paranoid these days with what's going on and uh	2979	A
yeah we get you know reports from the police will give us warnings about this neighborhood and some activity that's occurring there and then you know occasionally it works its way around to our neighborhood and we have to keep a real close rein on them_1 won't even let them_1 go out of our sight for a while and then	2979	A
after they catch that guy you know you can let him go out for a while but it's uh it's kind of sad	2979	A
i've got a nine year old and a seven year old and uh they both like to ride their bikes off into never never land and you know be	2979	A
um-hum	2979	A
yeah i used to uh i grew up in kind of a good combination of between the country and the city	2979	A
uh in East Texas and i had while we were in town we'd ride several miles away like to school and the like but when we were in the country we would ride	2979	A
ten twelve miles away we'd spend a whole day just two or three of us get together and take a lunch and go ride somewhere and eat lunch and come back and you know as long as we told the parents what roads we were going to be on and if there any	2979	A
trouble was they could come find us but uh can't do that now just no safe place to let your kid go that long and of course it probably wasn't that good of an idea back then either it just uh	2979	A
um-hum	2979	A
right	2979	A
you know they they're saying that the uh uh the education is going to be enough or at least a major part of the drug deterrent	2979	A
and though i remember when i was in school they had a a drug awareness week type deal that we studied in the science classes and we got little posters and we did all sorts of stuff but	2979	A
that was nothing compared to the you know campaigns that are going on now but i guess it's just the the class of people or the area that we're in but	2979	A
i i'm not in contact with any kids	2979	A
that think it's it's- it's- it's a positive thing to do i mean it is it is really looked down upon even to the point of smoking i mean that- my kids are so ingrained	2979	A
that they look down on them_1 we have to tell them_1 you know don't say anything in public to a stranger about his smoking you know not not quite that's not quite accepted yet now if he's in a nonsmoking area you might want to say something but	2979	A
they uh they're so outspoken on the topic that uh	2979	A
it's an interesting change in attitudes	2979	A
there's coming coming along with the education	2979	A
yeah	2979	A
yep	2979	A
yeah it won't take but a like uh maybe generation or so before it uh it- it no longer the cool thing to do i don't know	2979	A
hopefully hopefully we can get away from it yeah	2979	A
it's quite an expense too now they keep deciding that's the thing to tax	2979	A
yeah it keeps going up and up well i guess there's uh	2979	A
it's i don't know of any other major changes other than the political environment course that things are no longer the cold war scares and the things that are going on that realm and Russia's no longer the major enemy and	2979	A
i i don't know if there is one one easy one to uh to pick that's part of the problem	2979	A
yeah yeah	2979	A
they probably still do as far as humans go	2979	A
of course there you wouldn't be able to go over and attack them but i don't know that they'd be able to go anywhere and attack us they can't get all those people across the sea they don't have the ships to get them_1 anywhere so they may have a huge army but it's going to stay put	2979	A
uh it's kind of an interesting uh interesting problem not having any one enemy to focus on as a society	2979	A
tends to uh let that go out of the mind you're no longer concerned with the the weapon systems and the the defense area so now that Russia's gone as a major focused on enemy uh	2979	A
that whole defense issue is just not quite as important to people's lives	2979	A
so that's an an interesting social change i guess	2979	A
course it'll surprise them_1 some day when when all the hostilities start back up and some people aren't prepared for it so	2979	A
well it depends on the day and what i feel like i don't have a	2941	B
a real like strict dress code as far as you know suits and everything i can wear pretty much what i want as long as it's decent	2941	B
you know i can wear blue jeans i can wear a dress i can dress up	2941	B
so it just depends on the mood i'm in and where i'm going you know if i got a customer coming in then i'll dress up If not you know hey	2941	B
blue jeans	2941	B
uh-huh	2941	B
well that's all	2941	B
yeah	2941	B
oh we can't even wear shorts	2941	B
oh no shorts are no no go here you can't wear shorts you can't wear uh like halters and stuff like that and to me really you can't wear anything that's	2941	B
uh outside clothing you know like for the summer time and uh in the winter time i guess you can pretty much wear what you want as long as it's presentable that's what i consider	2941	B
you know just don't get too outrageous here	2941	B
and not too dressy like you know after five stuff i've never- some of them get sort of touchy too so	2941	B
and uh the women you see you have you can't wear halters or nothing like that i mean at all	2941	B
like even if you got a jacket on you got to have a bra on and all that stuff	2941	B
which no big deal to me so but as far as dress for dressing for work that i don't it doesn't bother me i'd prefer if we had a uniform	2941	B
i really would to save a lot of money if you had a uniform	2941	B
because when i while i was in the service and see i had clothes that i could wear whenever i got ready but	2941	B
you had to wear that uniform to work and so you knew what you was going to wear wasn't no what am i going to wear today	2941	B
nope	2941	B
that's right	2941	B
i wouldn't mind having a uniform people think i'm crazy but	2941	B
uh-huh	2941	B
that's right	2941	B
yeah because it it doesn't mess up your clothes either	2941	B
you know because like at work if something gets on my clothes and ruins it it's just ruined	2941	B
yeah well see if you work at a fast food because i work at Wendy's sometime on the weekends	2941	B
and they give you the uniform so it it's supplied so you know if it messes up hey it's their uniform they messed it up you only wear it you know to Wendy's so if you mess it up at Wendy's	2941	B
there's no big deal	2941	B
but you know uh of course TI i'm sure if they ever went to uniforms they're not going to just give them to you	2941	B
but now some of the people around here do wear uniforms you know the the facility guys or maintenance crew and the truck drivers and all of them have have TI	2941	B
yeah the yeah that's what they are too	2941	B
yeah	2941	B
yeah because they're always in the high space up you know working on stuff	2941	B
and all i do is i sit at a desk and program but that's not going to get me dirty so	2941	B
well uh mine it works pretty good i have a sweater at work because_1 sometimes it gets chilly and everything you know but uh but the whole building's like that i'm not in a clean room or nothing so	2941	B
um-hum	2941	B
yeah well see i just have my the whole building is computerized okay and so it's all air conditioned but my my computer is like by my desk and then	2941	B
you go to another cube and then somebody else's but uh the computer rooms now they're real cold and i don't have to work in one of those	2941	B
yeah	2941	B
oh well then yeah it's just-	2941	B
no matter	2941	B
and seems like it kicks in extra hard	2941	B
um-hum	2941	B
cold huh	2941	B
i think the reason why we can't wear shorts is because then the women and the men would be in competition	2941	B
see and then you guys couldn't work	2941	B
uh-huh	2941	B
uh-huh	2941	B
yeah	2941	B
yeah	2941	B
that's right	2941	B
um-hum	2941	B
now my boss now he he golfs every weekend	2941	B
so he's got different outfits	2941	B
and he cracks me up with these color codes	2941	B
the uh his aqua colors and i tell him see only people like you on the golf course wears them colors that's the only place you could probably wear it you know	2941	B
so	2941	B
yeah uh-huh	2941	B
now oh yeah	2941	B
yep	2941	B
no just when they go to play golf	2941	B
now i think IBM- now IBM has a strict dress code when i uh i went to apply for them before i came here and they- men they used to have to they have to wear white shirts i don't care what their job is they have to wear a suit	2941	B
and see to me i think that's ridiculous because you're working with all that xerox machines and stuff like that all that black ink huh-uh no give me a break dude no i think them them people should be able to wear blue jeans	2941	B
you know because that stuff gets really bad	2941	B
yeah	2941	B
they have a dress	2941	B
uh-huh	2941	B
uh-huh	2941	B
yeah	2941	B
yeah	2941	B
yeah	2941	B
God	2941	B
i don't think that should be your hair i mean yeah i guess so because some people do get wild with their hair	2941	B
you know with these haircuts now some of these haircuts boy i tell you i	2941	B
i don't know	2941	B
it's funny because my son is fifteen	2941	B
and he's into this fading crap you know	2941	B
the fade like it looks like no hair uh	2941	B
wait a minute and so he has hair though he can i can only let him fade it a little bit	2941	B
i tell him he's got to have hair all over or none one or the other you know you're not going to be going around with nine hundred ninety nine parts in your head and people's names carved in your head and	2941	B
no no huh-uh and not going no where with me he's not	2941	B
i told him no no hum-um we can't have that	2941	B
i'm not one of them liberated parents i guess i don't know	2941	B
yeah	2941	B
uh-huh	2941	B
well down here that's no big deal	2941	B
yeah	2941	B
well Pat what do you wear to work	2941	A
um-hum	2941	A
uh-huh	2941	A
yeah	2941	A
um-hum	2941	A
yeah my my schedule yeah my schedule's pretty similar i um i teach so on the days i teach i teach a couple days a week so whenever i teach i try and wear a tie	2941	A
but uh but that's i wear normally just wear like	2941	A
khaki pants and a shirt and tie i never wear a sport coat that's ridiculous but then most of the time you know then i just have to uh i can wear jeans or	2941	A
or just casual clothes i think they i think they frown on shorts and sneakers but i think i could probably get away with jeans and sneakers uh	2941	A
yeah i could well if i don't have to see students	2941	A
and uh i'm just in my lab and no one sees me then i'm probably okay	2941	A
um-hum	2941	A
yeah	2941	A
uh-huh	2941	A
right um-hum	2941	A
yeah well that makes sense	2941	A
uh-huh	2941	A
yeah as long as you're clean and yeah that makes a lot of sense	2941	A
uh-huh yeah that's true	2941	A
um-hum	2941	A
yeah	2941	A
yeah	2941	A
um-hum	2941	A
yeah that would matter- that would	2941	A
um-hum	2941	A
yeah and you don't have to worry about fashion and stuff too you know buying nicer clothes and things yeah hey that makes a lot of sense	2941	A
well you know my mother's a waitress and she has like three uniforms that she sort of wears in rotation and she likes that you know	2941	A
um-hum yeah your your	2941	A
um-hum that's right where the the uniform as- as a waitress now your uniform really it might be a little expensive when you first buy it but you know that's it doesn't it's made of polyester so it doesn't stain like cotton or wool would you know	2941	A
um-hum	2941	A
yeah um-hum	2941	A
yeah	2941	A
um-hum	2941	A
yeah well that makes sense yeah that makes a lot of sense	2941	A
um-hum	2941	A
uh-huh yeah	2941	A
um-hum	2941	A
that's probably the people that probably the people that are prone towards getting dirty	2941	A
yeah with the type of job that you have you might be getting dirty either either manual label labor where you'll perspire heavily or uh or where you'll come in contact with uh oil and things	2941	A
right um-hum	2941	A
yeah	2941	A
yeah that's what yeah i find too um if you're a programmer do you get cold does your how's your air conditioning work	2941	A
um-hum	2941	A
yeah	2941	A
um-hum	2941	A
oh oh see yeah because_1 my office is really heavily air conditioned because i guess they they keep the air conditioning on all the time where they don't in a lot of the other offices because_1 of the computers and um	2941	A
right um-hum	2941	A
yeah	2941	A
um-hum	2941	A
yeah yeah see sometimes my air conditioning gets really cold i think it's probably because my office is one of the only ones air conditioned in a	2941	A
a large area you know probably probably that's why i get because sometimes boy i'll get i'll freeze it's so cold in there especially when it's ninety degrees outside	2941	A
right yeah and blows on my legs man one time i left i thought i was going to i thought i was going to freeze the one day i wore shorts to the office because i was just going to be in my lab	2941	A
and i wanted to be comfortable because i thought the air conditioning would be all turned off you know and jeez if it wasn't the air conditioner wasn't blowing it wasn't fifty five degrees yeah	2941	A
that's true a lot of those nice looking legs yeah	2941	A
yeah i was just laughing it's funny that um we get clothing you know because uh i'm i'm in graduate school i only work part time and my wife	2941	A
uh we recently we decided we'd buy a sewing machine because that would be a good investment you know and we could make clothes and save money so she's made me shorts	2941	A
well of course you know she makes shorts and she says here i made you shorts and they're uh they're a nice material nice checkered plaid material here but	2941	A
but she didn't put a fly in them you know the pattern she bought didn't have a fly so it's like well they're fine for her but uh you know they're just everyday summer shorts you know but there's no fly	2941	A
yeah they're not for a guy that really changes your the whole way you do your day so i was laughing i thought that was funny you know because_1 i- well- i was i was up at the office and everybody says oh jeez those new shorts they- i think they were laughing because they are sort of a wild	2941	A
color you know but i was just crossing through to get my mail and stuff	2941	A
uh-huh	2941	A
yeah	2941	A
that's probably true without being laughed at uh-huh yeah i'm not i've never i i laugh at the wardrobe my father-in-law wears golf clothes and it's the only time he puts on those funny clothes yeah he doesn't wear those in the back yard or casually around	2941	A
just when they go to play golf they wear those funny clothes hat's true	2941	A
um-hum	2941	A
um-hum yeah	2941	A
um-hum	2941	A
yeah	2941	A
um-hum	2941	A
yeah but they have that dress code i- i you know i also know um EDS	2941	A
uh EDS i have some friends that interviewed with EDS and uh you know they interviewed while they were in college so they didn't really have a suit with them and the woman said to them well your second interview would be	2941	A
here but oh and on that day i would say wear a suit because i guess they just had on a sport coat and the one guy even had like um a gel in his hair you know his hair was sort of slicked back	2941	A
you know which is popular with the kids and and she says oh and you know uh i wouldn't put the gel in my hair you know in other words you're to borrow a suit- uh you know a two or three piece suit	2941	A
with no gel in your hair you know and that would she made it pretty clear during the interview- you know the the first interview how they were supposed to dress for the second interview you know	2941	A
so i thought that was really funny too you know	2941	A
um-hum	2941	A
um-hum	2941	A
i don't think my hair has probably changed in	2941	A
ten years	2941	A
um-hum	2941	A
he he's into what	2941	A
uh oh really	2941	A
uh-huh	2941	A
yeah i see them i see the kids with the the things cutting their hair all the time	2941	A
well that's- you know my dad was the same way i thought it was really funny back in the nineteen seventies my brother came home with cowboy boots on while was growing up in Pittsburgh and my dad called my brother Tex for about the next four weeks	2941	A
you know and other than calling him Tex he barely talked to him because he was so angry he was wearing cowboy boots	2941	A
yeah i thought it was just so funny you know my dad we're not in Texas	2941	A
it was very funny you know and all that over a pair of cowboy boots and it was finally my mother convinced him she you know the cowboy boots give you about uh an inch lift you know they sort of have a heavier heel	2941	A
and she and we're all short the whole family's short so she said well Sam if he wears cowboys that gives him another inch and it just may be	2941	A
i guess we're ready	2988	A
well i	2988	A
well- um	2988	A
well it's been a long time since i been in uh involved with public school systems uh	2988	A
my youngest girl has graduated and she graduated in eighty nine so	2988	A
um-hum	2988	A
well i don't know if uh you mean they keep the children they want the teachers to keep the children longer	2988	A
hello	2988	A
uh what do you mean by that statement do you mean they want the children- uh the teachers to keep the children longer than they're supposed to or are they to train them	2988	A
in all phases of life	2988	A
really you mean just in-	2988	A
well the discipline starts in the home	2988	A
and carries over into the school when they are school age and and	2988	A
and i think the school i think-	2988	A
oh that's	2988	A
well	2988	A
well it's just gotten uh completely out of hand as far as the violence in the schools and i don't know what the solution to that is at all i mean its just uh	2988	A
to me it's utter chaos i don't know how some of those teachers function because uh	2988	A
they are being violated by the students and	2988	A
i know that there are some schools that are patrolled by um	2988	A
private police and even public police and and and they're not getting any satisfaction from that effort	2988	A
i think uh i don't know what the solution is if the government doesn't know how are the um there's somebody that needs to rise up	2988	A
and have a plan that is going to resolve the many issues that are facing the public school system and i wouldn't know where to start since i haven't been involved in	2988	A
the public school system that much	2988	A
when my children were in school they were in a in a private school system so i mean we just	2988	A
i mean they just knew that they had to toe the line otherwise they would	2988	A
uh suffer the consequences and and that was enough for them i mean they just were very responsible	2988	A
kids and i didn't have any problems with them_1	2988	A
and i believe that uh that starts in the home and then if the children are influenced i guess they're influenced by their peers	2988	A
and uh monkey see monkey do a lot of times	2988	A
and it kind of	2988	A
well i guess that's the bottom line if the children do know right from wrong	2988	A
and uh with uh with so many of the parents being disorganized themselves it's no wonder that the children are so you have to look at that uh factor also	2988	A
where those children are coming from and what kind of home life they have	2988	A
okay so what's wrong with our school systems	2988	B
besides it's really screwed up some of them_1	2988	B
i don't think i don't think all of them_1 i think maybe mainly Dallas school systems because_1 Richardson is fine and my son was in Garland and Plano he was in all three them_1 Richardson Plano and Garland and i don't have any problems with with with them	2988	B
as far as you know	2988	B
i think	2988	B
oh my goodness i think the biggest problem -for now days with the school system is	2988	B
some of the parents i don't wanna say all of them_1 because_1 i'm not one of them_1 but some of the parents thinks just uh they're baby sitters and they're not	2988	B
you know they're putting a lot of responsibilities off on the teachers and i don't think they should i think they should also get involved	2988	B
<b_aside> under a shelf it's in there under there <e_aside>	2988	B
okay	2988	B
no more or less train- train them yeah	2988	B
uh sometimes more discipline discipline uh because	2988	B
they wouldn't be too much of a discipline problems i think if parents would um	2988	B
well that's that's what i'm saying	2988	B
that's right	2988	B
but i mean you have kids you have kids going to school with guns knives that's that's from the home but you know it's i don't know i guess parents aren't	2988	B
like when i was growing up you know you didn't have all this problems i mean we had problems in school but not like this	2988	B
nothing like the guns and the and the and the violence there is in the school with kids	2988	B
yeah	2988	B
hum-um	2988	B
yeah	2988	B
um-hum	2988	B
and they're not getting any paid neither i mean there's not you know it's like a hazardous job now to- in some schools i should say not all schools some schools you know it's	2988	B
well i've been involved and you know what	2988	B
i still don't know the problem i mean i wouldn't know where to begin to solve it i mean	2988	B
yeah	2988	B
yeah	2988	B
and then but see that also begins at home because he	2988	B
my son has well i i've seen a lot of kids you know and it's like i tell my son that's not my child	2988	B
what that child does don't you do i say well- see i'm not his mother	2988	B
and i you know you will get in trouble for something somebody else parent may or may not let they child do but you know right from wrong	2988	B
so	2988	B
yeah	2988	B
yeah but what- and then you got what about this other-	2988	B
well i know that uh i have only like two or three favorite television shows	2992	A
i think one of my favorite then is from the guy Stephen is it Brochco who does like LA Law uh-huh and uh he also did Hillstreet Blues i like those type of shows	2992	A
uh-huh	2992	A
uh-huh	2992	A
uh-huh	2992	A
oh yeah me too i know they uh i think they're different than a lot of other shows of which they have like the reruns in the middle of the season	2992	A
and then towards the end when everybody else is showing reruns they start showing some of their newer stuff	2992	A
so i thought that was really interesting the way that they did that	2992	A
oh and so you must watch a lot of uh Disney or cartoons then	2992	A
um-hum	2992	A
right	2992	A
um-hum um-hum	2992	A
oh that's true that's true well i noticed that my kids are uh older now they're uh getting close to the teenage years but they did we watched all of Mister Rogers and everything but even some of your uh cartoons can be very violent	2992	A
and uh you know they they talk about death and we were watching uh oh gosh that Bugs Bunny just last night	2992	A
and um uh i think it was on uh i have to remember which channel but anyway uh we were watching that and it was talking about opera and they showed like what they thought an opera would be and one of the things was to kill the rabbit kill the rabbit	2992	A
and i thought oh how violent you know to kill the rabbit so he ended up killing the rabbit in the end uh but then of course the the rabbit comes back to life and says well see this is how an opera is supposed to be	2992	A
and i thought gee whiz if a little kid was watching this you know that would be pretty violent even uh for a small child	2992	A
um-hum	2992	A
right	2992	A
that's right	2992	A
that's right well i don't think cartoons portray that but like	2992	A
yeah	2992	A
yeah a cat has nine lives	2992	A
but they don't they just have one like we do	2992	A
oh so that's really funny but uh we've gotten uh-huh go ahead	2992	A
um-hum	2992	A
um-hum	2992	A
yes	2992	A
yes yeah that's true that's a good show i used to watch uh Dallas i don't i don't know where you're at	2992	A
Dallas yeah yeah i used to watch Dallas years- years ago and somewhere in the middle i got uh bored and uh so i in fact i didn't even watch the finale	2992	A
uh you know that's about how disinterested i had become	2992	A
uh-huh	2992	A
well actually- uh-huh	2992	A
yep	2992	A
yep i know i know was- was it actually based on a book	2992	A
oh but you were just talking about okay	2992	A
okay	2992	A
yeah right	2992	A
that's true that's true	2992	A
stay um-hum um-hum yeah in if you notice and if you notice on Dallas they lost all the women	2992	A
yes so the men mainly stayed but the women were the ones who left and i thought that was very interesting and wondered kind of wondered about that uh	2992	A
well anyway that's a whole new issue oh goodness so anyway i don't know if our five minutes are over yet	2992	A
but we uh we also have the paid uh television channels uh the only thing i don't like about it especially with teenagers is that all the violence the sex the nudity and the curse words	2992	A
you know and so i know they didn't pick up these curse words from me so uh they had to have picked them up from uh the T V	2992	A
one nice thing though about the cable company we use they have uh	2992	A
they have that little parental uh uh key yeah yeah um-hum so i- i have that at home and i keep the keys with me	2992	A
and that's about the only way that i can that i can do it because_1 their natural curiosity you know to go towards that way and want yeah	2992	A
um-hum um-hum	2992	A
yeah	2992	A
that's true well and here lately it hasn't been that cool anyway with the humidity being so high	2992	A
well it was nice talking to you	2992	A
okay talk with you later good-bye	2992	A
uh-huh	2992	B
oh yeah uh-huh	2992	B
yes	2992	B
yeah we- we really enjoy that too	2992	B
uh i don't get a lot to watch a whole lot of TV we have a couple of young children and so	2992	B
we're usually outside and so it's usually the nine o'clock shows- shows that if we get them in bed we usually watch that and L A Law is one of my favorites	2992	B
yeah	2992	B
yeah	2992	B
well we have on Sesame Street and Mister Rogers that kind of stuff and i think those programs are really good for children i know that both of mine have probably learned quite a bit from there	2992	B
it's kind of nice to know that they're just going to be seeing you know not a lot of violence and that kind of stuff and they usually	2992	B
uh show a lot of things that really teach them different things about the world so	2992	B
my son- older son he's going to be five and he's more into watching the cartoons and that kind of stuff now so	2992	B
um-hum	2992	B
yeah	2992	B
oh yeah	2992	B
oh	2992	B
well yeah and you know they especially boys i mean they're always talking about shooting and killing and all that kind of stuff and i don't think that they really realize that death is forever you know	2992	B
and showing them something like that really doesn't teach them that it is	2992	B
no and to get them to feel like that that's just pretend i think is the hardest part you know	2992	B
yeah	2992	B
i i was just going to say i know that	2992	B
at least before our kids were born we used to always enjoy watching the Cosby Show Thursday nights usually had pretty good with that and as far as um very good comedy	2992	B
i like to watch Designing Women if the kids are in bed by then	2992	B
we're we're in Dallas uh-huh	2992	B
yes	2992	B
well i did watch it just to see what it was and wasn't- it wasn't really that great so i think after a while they just kind of you know there's no new stuff they can do they've done everything dirty in the book you know so	2992	B
well no i imagine	2992	B
everything you could think of you know had a hard time and i think maybe with Dallas as far as they lost a lot of characters that had been around at the first	2992	B
where i don't know i never watched Knots Landing but i think they've had a lot of their characters stay around	2992	B
yeah	2992	B
yeah oh	2992	B
uh-huh	2992	B
yeah	2992	B
where you can lock up the channel or whatever	2992	B
yeah	2992	B
yeah	2992	B
and i don't know the way the generations are up growing up now i mean i just think they watch so much more T V i try to limit what they watch they aren't sitting in the house watching T V all day	2992	B
because i think it's good for them to have physical activity and that kind of stuff too so	2992	B
and especially in the summer time we aren't in the house very much in the evenings it's the only cool time to be outside	2992	B
well true	2992	B
well it was nice talking to you too	2992	B
okay bye-bye	2992	B
well i've had a a little bit longer to think here because uh they waited about ten calls before they found you Bob but	2936	A
uh i i've been thinking about the fact that the uh Gramm-Rudman Act that was eventually- originally passed uh to satisfy- to satisfy- satisfy some of these deficiencies and place a	2936	A
set of handcuffs on Congress just doesn't work because now we do things outside the Gramm-Rudman with consent of Congress i guess and that doesn't seem to help us to much	2936	A
uh i mean the savings and loan was a great example of that that's outside the Gulf War was outside so it doesn't it i guess we just don't have the resolve to-	2936	A
to really face up and and and follow those instructions if- if indeed they are politically viable	2936	A
yeah	2936	A
right	2936	A
uh it seems to me that that there's there's a couple of ways that that i've listened to uh various Congress people and the President and the opposition and other people propose and	2936	A
and one thing that's starting to ring a little true to me is um rather severe cuts in	2936	A
in the defense programs since- like closing bases and closing down programs etcetera simply because i- i just don't believe as much as they want me to believe some of the special interests that you talk about	2936	A
that uh mother Russia is that much of a threat to us any longer	2936	A
i mean we're seeing this thing just crumble if- if anything now i see the President wants another billion- two and a half billion to loan them money because he's afraid of the outright uh chaos and confusion and anarchy because there's no food over there	2936	A
yeah	2936	A
yes	2936	A
yes	2936	A
yes	2936	A
yeah	2936	A
yeah	2936	A
exactly	2936	A
yeah	2936	A
just don't gore my ox right	2936	A
yes that's right	2936	A
well	2936	A
oh i guess we'd almost have to i mean i don't know it just seems to me we'd almost have to change the way we do business in government if we didn't have special interest groups i mean right down to the state and city levels and so on but i was wondering about	2936	A
you know i- i was a little bit encouraged although it didn't seem to work out too well in this debacle in the Fall when they last Fall when they	2936	A
they they did levy a tax on some of the people- richer people i mean they increased that bubble tax there i- i was a little encouraged by that because that's another way to cure the deficit is	2936	A
by higher taxes nobody wants to pay higher taxes but i mean there's going to be a crisis one of these days that's going to force us to do it anyway	2936	A
yeah yeah	2936	A
yes yes	2936	A
yes	2936	A
state tax	2936	A
yeah	2936	A
yeah yeah	2936	A
yeah	2936	A
yeah	2936	A
that's right of course it that that- that's again that that issue just like you sited Amory's bill on the bases but i- i don't know i it just seems to me	2936	A
that uh i mean i it it does seem to me now that twenty percent i- i think i'm correct in this that twenty percent of the federal budget is- is- is allocated now for debt payments	2936	A
or interest payment on the debt but uh yeah and and and i know if i had to pay that much in my out of my salary i mean it it it's	2936	A
it it just seems to me i don't know whether it it that's kind of a colloquium just use common sense but it- it just seems like there has to be some there will be a crisis at some point	2936	A
when the Medicare programs can't pay off when the when- when they can't pay off the the the savings and loans uh uh situation when the banks can't be insured any longer when the pensions can't be insured	2936	A
then people are really are going to demand something to be done but it appears to me that i don't know if there is any short term or long terms steps without a greater crisis that takes place	2936	A
yeah but how do you get people to do that though i mean i- i- i- i- i don't even find myself you know i see i- i play that game with myself sometimes	2936	A
i know things are a little tough so i say well i'll just charge this on the credit card and i'll pay it off in a little bit and then then every once in a while i get a shock i get the credit card up to six seven thousand i say this is absolutely insane and we sort of tighten up or something comes by to pay the damn thing off but	2936	A
i- i- i- i- i think that we're not paying anything off i mean obviously we're not paying anything off we we've gone from the largest creditor to the largest debtor nation in the last ten years and	2936	A
yeah that's right	2936	A
yeah i saw some Japanese guy on television today he was talking about the the the trade deficit he said	2936	A
as long- it's so it's so simple that that it was it was kind of it was kind of humorous he said as long as you continue to spend	2936	A
more than you continue to uh sell	2936	A
as long as you continue to buy in your country more than you continue to sell you'll have a trade deficit and until that comes under control uh the lending comes under control that that's your problem well i mean i- i started to laugh at that i mean it seems so simplistic but	2936	A
and it is a very complex situation but uh i- i guess but as a as an accountant do you do you find people are worried when you talk to them_1 about what our government might do or	2936	A
what they can't seem yes that that that's right	2936	A
yeah i was i guess i was a little comforted by the fact that on this Gulf War uh that we have received uh at least sixty percent of the money that we asked for and i- i should imagine	2936	A
i don't know how that's coming you know i remember some i- i just don't i haven't seen a real accounting of that	2936	A
so i guess i guess uh uh if i was to take a position now and sum up because_1 i don't want to talk too long is that the short term i guess we have to	2936	A
some how as you say address those issues in the long term we'd either have to- we'd have to raise taxes and cut back on some of the big the transfer payments and the military an and just bite that bullet	2936	A
okay i'm going to cut it off and uh because_1 i've got to go nice talking to you Bob bye-bye	2936	A
oh really	2936	B
yeah	2936	B
yeah i believe uh i believe that's right uh i guess uh uh you know really what we've got to do is is face up to the fact that uh	2936	B
our economy just will not support uh all of the programs that you know that the the the	2936	B
some of the people and i think it's you know the minority numbers not in minorities uh you know i'm not talking racial stuff but minorities- minorities in numbers uh	2936	B
uh want to have passed uh special interest groups uh have you know their own agenda	2936	B
and i think that it's time that uh Congress faces up to what i think the the people in general have faced up to is that we just cannot really support all of those things	2936	B
right	2936	B
right i- i believe that's true	2936	B
well i yeah- you know one of the things that i look at uh uh i'm in the Dallas area and uh Dick Armey is Congressman from Texas is one of the the sponsors of the	2936	B
the uh bill that's that called for the closing of military bases	2936	B
and one of the bases that's being closed or that's on the you know on the agenda to be closed is Carswell Air Force base in Fort Worth which is right you know right close by and when they decided that that was one that needed to be closed	2936	B
there was really a a huge cry you know from the Dallas Fort Worth area about you know	2936	B
how it's you know that one is the one that should not be closed you know it's it's not fair you know to to Dallas Fort Worth but uh you know when Amory's	2936	B
bill passed everybody said hey that's a great thing you know we're going to cut back on some of this unnecessary spending	2936	B
right and uh you know i think that's the the same case that that you know would hold true for a number of other programs uh	2936	B
we all talk about uh about how the the uh transfer payments you know are not handled correctly uh you know the the welfare programs and some- and some of those things and you know they all need major overhauls	2936	B
but	2936	B
they all need major overhauls until they're the ones you know until it's the one that that i sponsored or the one that my state gets the most benefit from or you know the one that that my children or my grandchildren or my mother or grandmother	2936	B
you know that we've all we all all got a special interest group that uh you know that's benefiting from some of these uh	2936	B
yeah	2936	B
right	2936	B
right i- i- i agree with that i i'm an accountant a CPA and i went to a seminar some seminars today and uh one of our opening speaker our keynote speaker this morning	2936	B
was is the president- of one of the major Texas companies or fairly major anyway and one of his comments had to do with the state taxes the state	2936	B
the state Texas is uh you know is in a little bit of a bind tax wise and one of the proposal is uh to uh have a new state income tax but to have it only on on corporations	2936	B
and of course you know he's corporate president corporate uh CEO and uh that was just not the right thing you know the the corporations are paying too much tax already so it's you know	2936	B
right so the same you know	2936	B
right the same you know same thing applies you know if the tax is is geared to- you know or or aimed toward me then it's a bad tax if it's aimed toward you it's a good tax yeah	2936	B
um-hum	2936	B
right- yeah i believe- at least that much	2936	B
um-hum	2936	B
um-hum	2936	B
you know i- i think that uh you know i think we're just going to have to as as Gerald Ford said we're going to have to bite the bullet and uh uh and	2936	B
um-hum	2936	B
right- yeah	2936	B
yeah	2936	B
yeah and i- i guess that's the the problem or you know as i see it anyway that	2936	B
we as a nation are not prepared to do what we as individuals would do and that's you know we cut off our spending and cut off our charging when our when our credit gets out of hand you know	2936	B
right	2936	B
um-hum	2936	B
um-hum	2936	B
right	2936	B
yeah i think uh i think not so much about what the government might do but that you know they're worried about what they're not you know what they can't seem to do uh it's you know it's it's everybody seems to agree	2936	B
that we're really in you know in dire financial situation that something has to be done and the concern is that nothing is being done you know	2936	B
right	2936	B
yeah i have not uh have not seen that	2936	B
all right Robert	2928	B
uh my dog just went on the floor anyway um what do you do about recycling in your area	2928	B
they separate everything for you	2928	B
uh-huh	2928	B
wow	2928	B
yeah	2928	B
right	2928	B
yeah	2928	B
that sounds like it's uh a really a	2928	B
what you have to do basically you have to make it as easy and convenient for people as possible and	2928	B
unfortunately while the responsibility should be on the consumer it will be placed on the cities now	2928	B
because you know of the convenience factor i try to get as i try to save aluminum cans and uh plastic and all that and whether i get much for it or not doesn't really bother me but uh	2928	B
you know i live in Sherman Texas which is probably a small town of about i don't know twenty twenty five thousand and they have sites around in the community the the grocery stores are really helping out a lot	2928	B
they allow you they've got fenced in areas on their properties and	2928	B
and you go and uh drop off all your goods there but like you said you have to separate them_1	2928	B
and uh	2928	B
i don't know if it's really i don't think it's that bad cleanliness wise	2928	B
because it's there on the store's property and it's on a it's on concrete- it's on you know asphalt and there's huge trash bins but there may be some unsightly creatures running around	2928	B
yeah yeah i	2928	B
i don't drop mine off there i take mine in to a uh	2928	B
a uh a big metal recycling place that takes about everything and they pay you for it so i've never taken mine to the to grocery stores and dropped off but	2928	B
uh-huh	2928	B
uh-huh	2928	B
uh-huh	2928	B
well all i was saying was that to get it done it would have to take	2928	B
the the convenience and- and the burden would have to be placed	2928	B
on someone other than the consumer because the consumer just won't do it so if if government should do it you know somebody's got to do it and if if anybody it should be the government	2928	B
but you know ultimately it should be the responsibility of the consumer but that just won't happen it's unrealistic so uh	2928	B
you know in the ideal society everyone would uh buy all unrecyclable- all recyclable stuff and everything would get recycled and we wouldn't have any problem but uh uh that's	2928	B
not feasible so uh yeah the government should probably step in and uh take a little more charge and what's really good is um	2928	B
uh that the government there in Raleigh i mean they've you know they provide the bags didn't you say that	2928	B
yeah	2928	B
uh-huh	2928	B
huh	2928	B
wow	2928	B
uh-huh i wonder if uh the government there makes any money off the recycling	2928	B
yeah	2928	B
uh-huh	2928	B
uh-huh	2928	B
hum	2928	B
uh-huh	2928	B
uh-huh	2928	B
hum	2928	B
uh-huh	2928	B
uh-huh	2928	B
hum	2928	B
no i didn't figure i'd get a lecture but yeah i never thought of that that's you know i didn't know there was such a price difference there what about oil recycling oil	2928	B
uh-huh	2928	B
well i was talking about like motor oil because i had read an article about ten years ago that said	2928	B
it costs so much less to just clean up the motor oil that's that's used in the engine and run it through a few different processes than	2928	B
you know it's it's more economical to actually do that and i was just wondering if it's just slow because it's messy or because there aren't the facilities available to recycle the oil i was wondering if you knew anything about that	2928	B
well as a matter of fact uh it's it's funny that i chose this subject because uh uh the city of Raleigh about six weeks ago has just uh put in a city wide recycling	2928	A
uh regime in which uh bottles and newspapers are recycled and a truck comes around uh once every couple of weeks and they separate your bottles for you and your newspapers and uh and they	2928	A
give you little uh or actually fairly large green plastic uh containers to put out curbside and all that so i think this is a real sign of progress here in the city of Raleigh	2928	A
they do all you have to do is you put all your glass in the bottom of this thing followed by your plastic followed by the newspapers and when they come around to pick it up they do all the separation so you only have one	2928	A
place to put stuff	2928	A
so they've made it uh they've made it convenient it used to be if you wanted to recycle you had to drive to a uh	2928	A
a central location in the city and then do all the separation yourself and a lot of people didn't do it just because the recycling location was so unpleasant	2928	A
because you know when you have all that amount of stuff pretty soon you have various kinds of vermin running around and	2928	A
women seem to have something against having mice running across their feet when they're trying to recycle	2928	A
right	2928	A
um-hum	2928	A
yeah	2928	A
i wonder what happens if somebody just misses with a bottle and it hits the asphalt i would think you'd just end up with a lot of broken glass unless you swept up everyday	2928	A
yeah	2928	A
yeah but uh it it it sounds let's see you you may you said one thing that uh uh you know just for the the sake of argument here um	2928	A
that that i'd like to bring up and that is whether it's the function of government to do the recycling rather than the individual consumer and i guess my opinion would be that that's maybe one of the few	2928	A
functions that government ought to do i can think of a lot of things that they shouldn't do that they do do	2928	A
but uh it seems like recycling is something that uh that the government ought to do and that everybody ought to pay for because i think in the long run	2928	A
it's one of those things that's that's of universal benefit to every citizen in the country	2928	A
right	2928	A
right right	2928	A
right	2928	A
they provide- well they provide these big plastic uh boxes actually they're a good size box maybe uh eighteen uh inches by uh thirty inches in size and uh you know maybe fifteen inches deep	2928	A
a good sturdy plastic box and it's got uh some uh uh bungy cord uh kind of arrangement so when you put your newspapers on the top they don't blow away in the wind if it's windy and uh	2928	A
and then they they apparently built these rather uh	2928	A
uh fancy trucks that come around and have and have the various bins for the recyclable- various colored glasses and a bin for the plastic and a place for the newspaper and they're kind of these high	2928	A
sort of uh high tech uh uh uh trash collector trucks they're big things too they must be as long as at least as long as a school bus	2928	A
and uh i'm sure it's costing the city of Raleigh money but of course	2928	A
i mean that comes out of the taxes and	2928	A
so the people are ultimately paying for it and i think that people ought to ultimately pay for the convenience of having newspapers and bottles and and plastics and all that	2928	A
well i think that they that they do attempt to uh	2928	A
that that that they they sell the the glass and the newspaper my understanding is that they don't meet expenses with it but that they offset a lot of expenses	2928	A
one of the problems with newsprint especially is that virgin newsprint costs about twenty five or thirty percent of what recycled newsprint costs so	2928	A
a newspaper company is not is not going to buy recycled newsprint when virgin newsprint is available at a third of the cost and i think one of the problems there is that	2928	A
is is the cost of virgin newsprint is not being accurately- accurately reflected because that cost ought to reflect the cost of recycling	2928	A
and	2928	A
and what the government needs to do really in a good capitalist society i mean capitalism thrives on there being a fair price for a product and	2928	A
and that price ought to has to include uh the cost of its disposal and it also has to include the cost of of any damage it inflicts on the environment	2928	A
and that's really where we as a capitalist society have gone have gone awry we have not	2928	A
really assigned costs appropriately for example the real cost of a barrel of oil if you take into account pollution and all of the other side effects is probably a hundred dollars a barrel	2928	A
now i'm just guessing but i bet you that that's an accurate guess	2928	A
and	2928	A
but we're we're paying twenty so the the cost is wrong on that thing and somewhere along the line you have to pay the piper that's what Adam Smith was saying hundreds of years ago as far as capitalism is concerned if you don't charge the right	2928	A
prices you're going to eventually that price is going to make itself felt but the way to make the system work is to is to put the price on the commodity and have the people who use the commodity pay that price	2928	A
and the role of government in a capitalist society is to see that that happens and the way government uh does that is through taxation	2928	A
so with newsprint for example the government should tax virgin newsprint to the point where	2928	A
its uh its price is pretty much the same as recycled newsprint and earmark that money for the recycling of newsprint you see what i mean	2928	A
so that the people who use the newsprint are ultimately paying for the entire product not only for its production but for its disposal	2928	A
hey i bet you didn't think you were going to get a lecture on	2928	A
well the the um of course most you know you can't recycle oil in the form of gasoline because it's destroyed	2928	A
so there's not a question of recycling there but there is a question of of uh environmental damage	2928	A
oh yeah	2928	A
uh-huh	2928	A
yeah i don't know when	2928	A
okay we're going to talk about lawn and garden today okay um where do you work at or do you you wish to discuss that	2984	A
oh okay	2984	A
yeah we're neighbors okay	2984	A
<b_aside> hi <e_aside>	2984	A
can you hang on just a minute thank you	2984	A
<b_aside> i have no idea he didn't broadcast thank you uh-huh <e_aside> i'm sorry go ahead	2984	A
oh i do all the time i do all the time i get a lot of good tips from him	2984	A
i have his book too um-hum	2984	A
not in Texas	2984	A
um-hum	2984	A
well no i had a lawn service one year and i thought phooey i'm going to do it myself because i figured up the cost and i said huh-uh i can do it much	2984	A
cheaper and better and so what i did i switched to a liquid and i do it with an applicator with my hose and it's so much easier than taking that lawn spreader and walking all over the territory i was surprised how easy it was	2984	A
and it- i thought well i'm going to do this all the time	2984	A
so i found you know and i've got some problems with uh two trees in my front yard and i took them to a certified uh nurseryman the other day and do you know what he told me i he needed to do	2984	A
the tree and the tree is fifteen feet high and it probably has about ten thousand leaves on it	2984	A
and he told me i needed to pull every leaf off and then spray it with this chemical that he	2984	A
said i should purchase and i thought uh-oh this is this is unreal this is unreal	2984	A
yes it's a disease that it's got and i don't know what happened to it uh and then it	2984	A
it um well-	2984	A
well one is a maple one is um	2984	A
a maple but i would much prefer i think it's not a native Texan tree	2984	A
and uh the one that the ones that really do well are the ones that are on the city property and they don't get any care and they're Cedar Elm and they're just beautiful	2984	A
so i mean it it's you know these things that you pamper	2984	A
some people have really a green thumb and you know and um although i don't have	2984	A
too serious a problem but i don't know if it was from the the the late freezes that were or the early freezes we had that caused this tree damage and you know Sperry said you know that's what happened to the Crepe Myrtles	2984	A
the last two years that you we are looking at all of the freeze damage from the prior two years	2984	A
so i kind of think that maybe that uh happened to these large trees that i have	2984	A
and i really hate to lose them_1 but um	2984	A
that's one of the hazards i guess of uh having a a yard because i	2984	A
um-hum	2984	A
right the quick growing yeah and they and he	2984	A
um um-hum	2984	A
can i pick your brain about how you got rid of those trees did are they still there did you cut them_1 down at the at the ground level or did you pull them_1 up by the roots or how did you get rid of them_1 because if i	2984	A
i i don't know how to get rid of these big trees because_1 one has a circumference of about ten inches and	2984	A
oh	2984	A
um-hum	2984	A
oh	2984	A
um-hum	2984	A
because_1 i don't want stubs in my lawn because you still have to	2984	A
um-hum	2984	A
the base to the ground um-hum	2984	A
bore	2984	A
i see try- uh a stump killer yeah uh-huh	2984	A
uh-huh	2984	A
yeah and they get that saw and i think it's a kind- some kind of a screwing- a screwing thing that just rips it right out	2984	A
right out yeah	2984	A
used those for uh mulch sure	2984	A
sure	2984	A
um-hum	2984	A
a blessing in disguise i mean you- two fold purpose yeah	2984	A
lawn yes um-hum yes i have a i have a self-propelled uh Snapper	2984	A
because i'm sitting on a hill and it uh and it's very difficult to address	2984	A
oh {booey} yeah	2984	A
yeah they always try to give you a song and dance	2984	A
okay so	2984	B
right what	2984	B
uh	2984	B
no i i'm in uh well i live in uh Richardson Texas and uh	2984	B
yeah	2984	B
and uh but grew up in uh Iowa on a farm with a considerably different philosophy in terms of lawn and garden work uh and uh	2984	B
yeah	2984	B
no so uh	2984	B
uh not not growing up familiar with here uh uh	2984	B
when i get a chance i listen to Neil Sperry and do that and uh	2984	B
yeah uh	2984	B
yeah don't do any uh any gardening in the sense of uh vegetable gardening but uh	2984	B
tried- tried- tried some tried some different flowers and and uh bushes and stuff and uh	2984	B
uh have a	2984	B
have a lawn service there was one when we when we bought the house and we just continued with them for a long time and then switched to a different one but in terms of the fertilizing and uh weed control mainly leave that up to them what about you	2984	B
yeah	2984	B
yeah	2984	B
yeah	2984	B
yeah	2984	B
well	2984	B
well good	2984	B
yeah	2984	B
no	2984	B
yeah	2984	B
yeah	2984	B
what what what kind of a is this some sort of a disease or is it a pest	2984	B
what	2984	B
well what kind	2984	B
what kind of trees are they	2984	B
huh	2984	B
yeah	2984	B
uh-huh	2984	B
uh-huh	2984	B
yeah	2984	B
yeah	2984	B
yeah	2984	B
yeah	2984	B
yeah yeah well that's that's one thing that we had- we've had	2984	B
very poor luck with with- is in in our yard is is trees but the uh what what trees were were there when we moved in uh uh	2984	B
were had been put in by the	2984	B
developer when he built the house and he just put in whatever was cheapest that he could claim was a tree i think yeah and uh	2984	B
figured up last night at there were seven	2984	B
different trees of of various kinds and sizes in the yard when we moved in and we got one left at this point but uh a couple of them_1 we've lost to the wind- weren't too good trees we've lost to wind uh uh	2984	B
three we three we've lost to to uh freezes between uh eighty three and uh	2984	B
and then uh a year ago we lost uh	2984	B
another one	2984	B
well	2984	B
yeah well- we didn't have- we didn't have any that were that	2984	B
that big when they uh went two of- two of them_1 uh the wind the wind blew over uh	2984	B
in in terms of getting them down uh	2984	B
but yeah yeah now the- the one that the one that we lost	2984	B
the last one that we lost a a year ago uh up- up until then they don't- hadn't been big enough but what i just	2984	B
used a hand saw and sawed them_1 off at at as close close to ground level as i could and then	2984	B
uh got some got some chemical that you drill holes and pour in that helps	2984	B
helps rot the stump killer- yeah stump killer and stump stump rotter but uh this last one had a fair sized root and some guy	2984	B
was doing a job in the neighborhood uh and and saw it and stopped in and asked if i didn't want the stump dug out on the spot for thirty five bucks and i said fine and he had he had a trailer with a machine on it that was specifically for that and it	2984	B
yeah	2984	B
yeah and it it just it just ripped it right-	2984	B
right out and uh	2984	B
i took the it- it left the it left he left the chips and i	2984	B
put them up	2984	B
mulch around- around around the other shrubs and uh	2984	B
uh had had a pile of dirt from various things uh	2984	B
back by the garage that i filled in with and and it's filling in with with grass uh nicely this year so that that was that was worth it but uh	2984	B
yeah yeah but uh	2984	B
yeah well you- do you do your own uh lawn in terms of uh mowing	2984	B
yeah	2984	B
oh yeah	2984	B
yeah i uh	2984	B
yeah i- i- i	2984	B
uh we just got a a old push uh uh Sears mower i it's been	2984	B
fifteen years now since we- we first moved to Texas we've had it and i keep waiting for it to die but	2984	B
every year it just seems to hang on and uh	2984	B
and uh i do it my do it myself but uh yeah well- a year a year ago i took into took it into Sears to have it tuned up for the season and they said	2984	B
no it's it's too old we won't even work on it and and i took it back home and it's can't kept plugs along but uh but my son's uh one- one of my sons and a couple of his friends this year have	2984	B
all right do you have a bunch of factories and stuff out there	2938	A
the uh	2938	A
oh you mean	2938	A
for like smog and stuff	2938	A
hum	2938	A
uh-huh	2938	A
huh	2938	A
what do you think of that uh the	2938	A
greenhouse effect that's going on	2938	A
yeah	2938	A
that's causing the hole in the ozone	2938	A
uh-huh it it is scary though isn't it	2938	A
right	2938	A
well all right North Carolina that's up there by Kentucky isn't it	2938	A
uh-huh	2938	A
okay	2938	A
okay well Kentucky's next to Virginia i'm pretty sure well i'm from Kentucky i should know but i don't i'm sorry but Kentucky we use to have severe i mean just real cold cold winters and we'd have three and four feet of snow course here in Texas	2938	A
well how old are you	2938	A
okay well we're the same age yeah i forget my age all the time so that's okay it's i think it's just something that goes with the territory but to me Texas see and Kentucky we had to have ice on the ground for them to close school okay	2938	A
in Texas i'm serious if it gets cold and it looks like it's going to rain i i swear they close everything down i just laugh i mean i do they get i mean and traffic slows down to nothing	2938	A
oh well no northern- i'm from the north that's why i said we in Kentucky we i don't know you just get used to weather and of course the people down in south they don't- they're not used to cold weather and stuff and uh	2938	A
it just i don't know i just laugh everytime they have a	2938	A
everytime they have snow on the ground everything's closed up and you know you can have snow on the ground and not be slick on the road	2938	A
but uh	2938	A
no not really i mean not to see it now of course there's you know TI is here Oscar Mayer	2938	A
and there is a few factories but i don't see much pollution going on	2938	A
um-hum	2938	A
well see they have that um uh what is it a vet test or something like that they call it	2938	A
and uh that's supposed to cut down on it	2938	A
yeah school buses and the commercial buses yeah	2938	A
well they're burning that diesel fuel is what it is	2938	A
and uh	2938	A
it it gets bad	2938	A
uh-huh	2938	A
well that's a good idea	2938	A
uh-huh	2938	A
well uh the you know pregnant women aren't supposed to walk along a highway	2938	A
because of that smoke fumes when i was pregnant with my first little boy i had read it because back then i was walking back and forth to Kentucky- from well not back and forth i was walking home from uh	2938	A
the college i was going to in Kentucky and i was having to walk along the highway it was just one day a week but it was in	2938	A
i i have no sense of smell so i couldn't smell this but	2938	A
it would make me sick and i'd be real tired anyway just from walking along the highway	2938	A
but yeah it's yeah it's all the exhaust uh well that was four years ago too it's probably a lot worse now yeah	2938	A
uh-huh	2938	A
do you uh	2938	A
smoke	2938	A
well- yeah it's kind of like-	2938	A
uh-huh	2938	A
yeah because you do smoke one a day	2938	A
hum uh	2938	A
for the air pollution	2938	A
huh	2938	A
but they i don't hear much about it down here course Texas we don't have a bunch of pollution but too we've got that air coming in off the coast and you know it'd blow it up north	2938	A
so maybe that's part of the reason it's not so bad down here	2938	A
but no it'd seem like it would be the same way in on the California coastline wouldn't it	2938	A
um-hum	2938	A
uh-huh	2938	A
but they usually have that everywhere because of the humidity especially	2938	A
i think they do that for most everybody it's especially it's usually for the young children and the older	2938	A
the old people	2938	A
older old people	2938	A
it is	2938	A
uh-huh	2938	A
oh	2938	A
oh well this is pretty wooded area down here so in- in a lot of parts yeah i know Texas is supposed to be flat but they've got you know down by the Denison Dam there's a lot of uh	2938	A
they do they live close then in Durant Oklahoma	2938	A
you go where	2938	A
uh you go to visit them	2938	A
oh	2938	A
yeah well down by Lake Texoma there's a bunch of wooded area this but Kentucky's beautiful they've got trees and trees are supposed to you know purify you know what the best indoor purifying plant is for smoke and stuff it's a philodendron	2938	A
it's supposed to filter the air for you in your home i had one my husband bought it for me when my daughter was born three months ago- four months ago yeah i do yeah i do	2938	A
yeah i did i couldn't make myself quit i did cut down a lot i got i've i've got one vice and smoke is smoking is it i don't i don't drink and i try not to cuss and i don't- i do	2938	A
very little and smoking i just i got in the habit of it when i was about thirteen	2938	A
yeah we're down here at the Bible belt aren't we uh i wasn't saved until i got down here and people down here are just there's so many Christians and it's so	2938	A
different from Kentucky but	2938	A
um i worked at TI for a while but then my brother-in-law works there and he got me into it	2938	A
how'd you get into it	2938	A
uh-huh	2938	A
well it's fun i like talking to new people and i	2938	A
half the time well a couple of times i've been interrupted by my little girl i've had to hang up and stuff but i enjoy it i talked people from well Carolina- well Carolina now	2938	A
up in uh Boston and New York well Boston is New York isn't it	2938	A
no Boston Massachusetts but i've talked to people in New York but i've talked to a lot of people in Texas	2938	A
because i guess it's because_1 of TI's down here	2938	A
uh-huh	2938	A
well-	2938	A
with Boston i love their accent i do i love a Boston accent- accent i met a girl from Boston one time my husband was in the service so we went from	2938	A
Kentucky to Louisiana down here to Texas	2938	A
and his family's down here we're out of the service now but yeah he got out of it his unit right after Panama we went to Panama- he went to Panama when Noriega was doing all that	2938	A
and uh he	2938	A
um we've got	2938	B
quite a few actually what we're more concerned with is the inner pollution in the city uh we've actually had some warnings in uh Raleigh uh on air pollution	2938	B
uh-huh because of there're so many cars and we have a belt line along- around Raleigh where we're trying to divert traffic	2938	B
and um you know it's- it's still it's just surrounding the city and you can actually see it there's a couple of uh tall buildings in Raleigh and and you can actually you know they're blurred they're even dark and what it is is the pollution	2938	B
well i guess that's fluorocarbons- the fluorocarbons and uh	2938	B
uh-huh	2938	B
yeah that's very serious i mean we can we're even feeling the effects of the weather from uh uh the shift in the jet stream	2938	B
oh yeah i mean uh the last two uh years our winters have been absolutely nothing i mean maybe one snow	2938	B
Kentucky uh North Carolina is all the way on the east coast it's further west than Georgia it's uh right below Virginia	2938	B
uh-huh	2938	B
uh-huh originally i'm from Texas so i mean Amarillo so uh uh-huh	2938	B
yeah real close	2938	B
um i've been out of Texas about ten years	2938	B
oh twenty uh seven i almost forgot my age oh really	2938	B
hum	2938	B
uh-huh	2938	B
actually they've been doing the same thing here it's you know it's kind of funny they um i guess northerners are different but even uh North Carolinians they don't know how to handle cold weather	2938	B
um-hum	2938	B
that's true	2938	B
do you all have much pollution there	2938	B
uh-huh	2938	B
well you know what irks me is these cars that are driving down the road and you have that black smoke coming from their tail pipe	2938	B
uh-huh	2938	B
well supposedly that's supposed to catch it but i'll tell you what and even these buses oh lord it's real bad these buses in Raleigh	2938	B
oh yeah	2938	B
i mean school buses are notorious	2938	B
oh yeah yeah	2938	B
well you know what they've started doing is is instead of the tail pipes being at the bottom of those buses they've started putting them_1 up at the top	2938	B
and that way it gets above um other cars on the road	2938	B
and uh it really does make a difference although it it settles you know even if it's at the top and it's a lot of black smoke coming out it still settles and	2938	B
and you know if you're going to be jogging on the side of the road that's that's even more miserable i would i'd have to go out to the country to jog	2938	B
no i didn't know that	2938	B
uh-huh	2938	B
hum	2938	B
uh-huh	2938	B
golly that's	2938	B
that's bad	2938	B
oh i'm sure well they um you can really feel it you know in your breathing even normal people and if you're older um i mean you can really	2938	B
deplete your oxygen and it'll you know pass out and it's you know it's killed several people	2938	B
um actually i'm a very i just smoke one in the evening if that so i'm a very very light smoker	2938	B
it was kind of funny they were doing some uh ozone testing and uh the- the EPA and they were just screening some candidates	2938	B
and i don't think i'd ever you know do that but they uh asked me if i was a smoker and i didn't fit into the smoker's category and i didn't fit into the nonsmoker's category um it was you know i was just one of those	2938	B
yeah in between people so that kind of threw them_1 off	2938	B
but they're doing a lot of research here uh the EPA	2938	B
for ozone and oh yeah all that they're they're real big into it they've got Research Triangle Park here	2938	B
and they're you know they're just doing a lot of uh lot of stuff	2938	B
hum-um	2938	B
oh uh-huh	2938	B
uh-huh	2938	B
um-hum	2938	B
oh gosh i think i would hate to live in California the smog there i mean i can't believe they have warnings here which it it's mainly just when it gets real real hot	2938	B
really well- well that's kind of good to know because i thought Lord i thought i lived in a halfway decent area	2938	B
hum	2938	B
uh-huh	2938	B
well you ought to come to North Carolina it's a big change yeah	2938	B
there's no trees where i was from in Amarillo and here they've got the mountains the beach the trees you know it's they've got streams rivers ponds it's really pretty here	2938	B
is it	2938	B
um-hum	2938	B
Sherman and Denison do you know my grandparents live in Durant	2938	B
yeah	2938	B
yeah real close i go there yeah	2938	B
oh uh-huh	2938	B
yeah we used to go fishing in Lake Texoma	2938	B
huh huh-uh	2938	B
oh really	2938	B
well i'm going to have to get some	2938	B
um-hum do you smoke	2938	B
do you	2938	B
did you smoke when you when you were pregnant	2938	B
well i mean i can understand that actually	2938	B
well	2938	B
yeah well one thing i miss is uh is the people from Texas are are you know i miss their morals their values and everything it's uh	2938	B
um-hum how'd you get involved in this research	2938	B
oh i see huh	2938	B
um i i was taking a voice IO class	2938	B
and um and actually doing some research and so they told me about this project	2938	B
uh-huh	2938	B
uh-huh	2938	B
um-hum	2938	B
um-hum	2938	B
uh no Boston's above uh-huh	2938	B
yeah i've talked to a lot of people in Texas i had one call from- actually from Charlotte North Carolina and Virginia and um	2938	B
i can't remember where all	2938	B
um up north like you said i think one was from Boston	2938	B
um-hum	2938	B
um-hum	2938	B
oh i bet you're glad	2938	B
uh-huh	2938	B
oh gosh	2938	B
well i have to say my favorite type of music would probably be uh classical music	3962	B
um-hum	3962	B
um do you go to the operas that they sing English or go to the ones that they sing other languages	3962	B
um-hum	3962	B
um-hum yeah i- i haven't gotten into that too much because_1 i uh if i don't know the story line and um i don't speak the language then i have difficult time	3962	B
comprehending what's going on	3962	B
um-hum	3962	B
what is that	3962	B
oh i didn't know that	3962	B
that can help people like me	3962	B
well i can understand that	3962	B
so i'd say Vivaldi is probably my favorite uh composer	3962	B
yeah i like Baroque music i like full body music uh with the uh	3962	B
uh with brass and winds wood winds instruments uh course i like uh also string instruments and i have two string instruments in my house uh instrument players	3962	B
both my sons play string instruments one plays a Cello and the other one plays the Viola	3962	B
so i get to go to at least four or five concerts a year	3962	B
uh one is thirteen and one is eleven	3962	B
yes	3962	B
yes sure	3962	B
yeah we're on our way	3962	B
so uh um i try to enjoy all of it	3962	B
um a little bit but um a lot of the um music i don't know about uh as far as the titles and i have to listen to it and and figure out what i'm listening to	3962	B
um i do belong to a Musical Heritage Society	3962	B
do you belong to that	3962	B
you can get recordings uh they now have them_1 on compact disc or uh or cassettes or LP's	3962	B
and uh they do their they do a lot of original recordings themselves	3962	B
uh but they also uh they also uh go to the different composers or the different i guess uh what do you call them_1	3962	B
the guys that orchestrate	3962	B
the conductors- the conductors yeah they go to conductors uh and and they actually have them perform the music and they record it	3962	B
sure a lot of them_1 are	3962	B
or they will know find out when they're performing and they will uh record the music at that time and so uh it is uh	3962	B
uh high quality grade music and of course now they're getting in they also have a jazz section and they also have a uh more contemporary and American uh composer section	3962	B
yeah	3962	B
well you can control it uh	3962	B
oh really	3962	B
i see	3962	B
huh well that's good	3962	B
yes i- i play guitar and and early years played saxophone	3962	B
well uh what is your favorite kind of music	3962	A
oh same here yeah	3962	A
oh well i guess i like a wide range uh everything from uh from Baroque through at least some modern music	3962	A
and my wife and i these days are especially into opera we've been sort of opera fans for a few years now	3962	A
well we uh generally the places we've gone they sing in the original languages	3962	A
like the Dallas Opera here normally does i guess	3962	A
well one thing that's helped us a lot is that uh you you know you can buy a lot of these operas now on video cassettes- uh video tape	3962	A
and so we have quite a collection of those and you watch them_1 at home and they have subtitles so you you figure out what's going on after a while and then you can enjoy it in the uh theater	3962	A
but you know the uh Dallas opera now has uh super titles on on all their performances i think	3962	A
well they they give an uh an English translation on a on a screen up above the stage	3962	A
yeah	3962	A
in fact they even do that for operas sung sung in English because_1 it is hard to understand the words some times	3962	A
yeah well i really like Vivaldi uh he's uh definitely uh one of the one of the top of that era	3962	A
um-hum	3962	A
oh	3962	A
uh-huh how how old are they	3962	A
so they're doing this in school or what uh-huh	3962	A
well you've got half a string quartet there	3962	A
yeah	3962	A
well since you seem to like uh Italian music have you ever uh gotten into Gabrielli or anybody there in that era the uh	3962	A
uh period right before actually before Vivaldi i guess	3962	A
uh-huh	3962	A
oh yes uh-huh	3962	A
no i don't but i think i know what it is isn't that a uh uh see can't you get records through that or something recordings	3962	A
um-hum	3962	A
yes yeah i think uh	3962	A
uh	3962	A
uh yes right	3962	A
so they're actually commissioned performances	3962	A
uh-huh	3962	A
uh-huh	3962	A
well i have good- heard good things about the uh Music Heritage Society	3962	A
but if i get involved in one of those things i end up spending all my money on the on the music or	3962	A
almost uh almost uh bankrupted myself out of college as a freshman when i got into the Columbia Record Club many years ago	3962	A
yeah my room mate signed me up he got a bonus record and i got a lot of bills	3962	A
so we have to watch that	3962	A
uh do you play an instrument yourself	3962	A
what's your favorite television show Barbara	3940	A
uh-huh	3940	A
oh my favorite- my favorite television show is Northern Exposure	3940	A
oh it's great it's such a funny show	3940	A
but uh	3940	A
i didn't watch it for the first season then a friend of mine did- had commented how good it was and i started watching it it's just a hoot	3940	A
but uh other than that i like uh Jeopardy	3940	A
you know the old Jeopardy game show	3940	A
uh-huh	3940	A
yeah boy that's a that's that's a hugely popular show	3940	A
yeah well uh um Jeopardy comes on right after Wheel of Fortune Monday through Friday here in Miami	3940	A
and uh i i like to to pit my knowledge against uh the other contestants	3940	A
yeah some nights i feel like oh golly i could do that and then other nights i think gosh i'm glad i'm not up there because i'd make a fool of myself so it depends so they they have some awfully awfully uh clever people who know just a a vast amount of trivial information	3940	A
so that's- that's interesting to me	3940	A
yeah i do as a matter of fact they had one not too long ago and one of the questions was what is the most populous country uh south of the equator	3940	A
you know and i would have guessed Brazil it turned out it was South Africa	3940	A
yeah which i would have never i don't know for some reason that never would have popped in my mind now what what good that knowledge is i don't know but it was a interesting piece of trivia	3940	A
uh again i there have been you know a couple of times when i thought you know golly i i could have you know i could have won tonight and then again there are other times when i watch and	3940	A
you know i know that i wouldn't have done so well but uh yeah i guess anybody that that watches those uh you know probably thinks uh occasionally about it the interesting thing about Jeopardy is that they never do uh	3940	A
uh give any information on how to compete they do say that if you're going to be in the Los Angeles area and want free tickets they tell you how to get that but they don't ever say anything about uh uh	3940	A
uh uh competitor- you know how to how to get to be a competitor- a competitor	3940	A
well they might they might that could be it and then again it could just be that they want people to take the initiative to write in you know expressing an interest i don't know	3940	A
um um there's a there's one that started this season it's called uh Home Improvement	3940	A
you didn't like that	3940	A
yeah	3940	A
yeah i saw that	3940	A
yeah well anyway i i kind- i kind of get a kick out of that one just because uh i like the uh the the husband on there he's always trying to put more power into all the electrical appliances	3940	A
but- but uh then after that Roseanne comes on which i have uh friends who just abhor Roseanne but i think it's a funny show	3940	A
yeah it's cute it's a cute show it really is	3940	A
but i like the uh not so much Roseanne but i like their children on there Darlene in particular the middle daughter i think she's a good little actress	3940	A
um	3940	A
you mean like the the little kids um well i	3940	A
my favorite	3940	B
well i have several but my think my uh very favorite is uh	3940	B
oh	3940	B
i've been yeah	3940	B
my mind just went blank	3940	B
uh Pros and Cons i enjoy that	3940	B
and i like the Bill Cosby Show	3940	B
what about you	3940	B
i haven't seen that i'm going to have to start watching that	3940	B
yes i watch that occasionally	3940	B
yeah i enjoy game shows uh since i work during the day i'm uh	3940	B
watch uh Wheel of Fortune in the evening	3940	B
yes it is	3940	B
uh-huh	3940	B
are you pretty good	3940	B
yes do you find you learn a lot on those shows	3940	B
uh-huh	3940	B
really	3940	B
that's good uh do you ever feel sometimes you'd like to compete in one of those	3940	B
uh-huh	3940	B
competing	3940	B
do you think maybe they pick them_1 out of their uh audience	3940	B
uh-huh	3940	B
do you have any situation comedies that you really like	3940	B
i saw that one time and i didn't care for that because_1 it seemed like the kids were uh very uh obstinate and rude and it was they were trying to teach them manners	3940	B
did you see that one	3940	B
and i didn't like that aspect so i and that was the first one i watched but i should probably try to a second time	3940	B
i don't care for her either	3940	B
i just i just i but i like Evening Shade have you watched that lately	3940	B
it really is	3940	B
uh-huh	3940	B
that's great um	3940	B
do you ever think about those uh twins and triplets that are on those shows you ever think about uh	3940	B
how they can teach them at such a young age	3940	B
yeah	3940	B
okay um	3917	A
do you wanna go ahead or	3917	A
um-hum	3917	A
um-hum	3917	A
um-hum	3917	A
right	3917	A
i do too i like the idea i see a lot more um my children i have five children and they're all married	3917	A
and um i love seeing the men help the women so much and they both cooperate together oh and i think it's great	3917	A
right	3917	A
right	3917	A
that's right that's right yeah i've always taught my men that they better clean up with their women and help them if they did that you know	3917	A
and they're they're good about it but it is neat to see them all work together and a big thing though i see all that most of the	3917	A
most of the women getting married now uh go back- have gone back to you know they they stay at work or go back to work or whatever and they're well educated	3917	A
and i believe we'll see a lot more CEO's in companies they're having a fit about how little there are	3917	A
and i think we'll see a lot more don't you of upper management	3917	A
than we do now even	3917	A
i think it'll escalate	3917	A
and uh and i think black women now if in fact i work at a high school	3917	A
and my boss is a black woman and has only been there a couple months and already promoted and she's very sharp and i think that in the ethnic	3917	A
thing will be you know is a good thing now they're moving them up and they're sharp and they	3917	A
so you're going to see a lot- more- a lot more of that in leadership i believe	3917	A
um-hum	3917	A
right	3917	A
right that's a shame	3917	A
yes yeah but they wouldn't know what they're doing	3917	A
to the men at all but i never have gone along with that you know even far back but i was brought up pretty good in a home that	3917	A
years ago my mother was that way the same my boys- the our you know some people say oh the boys shouldn't have to do those jobs the inside jobs but we never were taught they had to do as much as we did so that was good	3917	A
so that's i think that's good to keep the equal as far as	3917	A
as uh not necessarily- necessarily- uh necessarily by sex type thing	3917	A
you know you should be able to accomplish as much and i think the uh attitude is a lot better towards the parents raising the younger ones now	3917	A
you see a lot more of the mothers and all saying to the young girls you know you can do it if he can do it you can do it type thing	3917	A
um-hum	3917	A
um-hum	3917	A
right what about politics on it	3917	A
do you think the political scene	3917	A
yeah	3917	A
i'm real disgusted- i'm kind of disgusted this year because i don't see many women into the political scene and i really think we should have more	3917	A
political leaders in the women than we do up for and even for president and vice president this year there's nobody again i think they're all scared out after that after um	3917	A
oh what was the lady's name that ran a couple of Fitzgerald- i forget her name now but you know who i mean	3917	A
yeah she took such a rough go of it and they tax- their tax deal and	3917	A
right right but i wish they would get some more on that- i really was disappointed this year when i see any of the candidates talking that they're talking about	3917	A
um they i didn't see any of the women in there and that disappoints me	3917	A
and right now i don't think we have too many that- uh in the forefront Schroeder's about the biggest one in Washington	3917	A
congress woman	3917	A
and um other than- uh you know we really	3917	A
oh sure um well	3917	B
i um went to school at Madison for two years and they're really big on women's rights and and equal treatment	3917	B
and so i- i seen a lot of like rallies and things like that but um	3917	B
i'm not that liberated i mean my mom's kind of old fashioned you know so i you know you pick up some traits from her and stuff but um i think it's	3917	B
i think it's interesting and	3917	B
better for women to see that there's more more of them_1 doing men's fields i like to see that	3917	B
and i don't like to see women you know like waiting on men hand and foot but you know i- i believe in like sharing and doing things for each other	3917	B
um-hum	3917	B
right	3917	B
oh me too i hope that happens to me someday i mean i- i don't mind doing stuff um i have a boyfriend and like i'll make him dinner and stuff but you know and he'll help me do the dishes i don't want him you know	3917	B
expect to have to clean up then after yeah yeah so	3917	B
right	3917	B
um-hum	3917	B
right	3917	B
um-hum	3917	B
oh	3917	B
oh yeah um-hum	3917	B
right	3917	B
yeah	3917	B
um-hum	3917	B
oh me too	3917	B
yeah i like to see that i think it's um	3917	B
really neat to seeing all what educated minority um person who really knows what they're talking about and	3917	B
it's just too bad that some people you know still look down on them_1 just because of their color you know especially black women	3917	B
so	3917	B
right	3917	B
um-hum	3917	B
right	3917	B
right same here yeah	3917	B
right same here	3917	B
um-hum	3917	B
yeah	3917	B
yeah	3917	B
exactly i i see more men um like participating in like the family things with children like you know helping to take care of them_1 more and	3917	B
and um	3917	B
um doing the jobs equally yeah	3917	B
oh i'm not that big on politics i'm not that educated on it i'm	3917	B
oh yeah i agree with that	3917	B
oh i don't know yeah i know who you're talking about	3917	B
uh yeah at least she was strong enough to like try it and you know	3917	B
so that's good	3917	B
um-hum	3917	B
oh	3917	B
um-hum	3917	B
oh well	3969	B
well mostly rock	3969	B
yeah what about you	3969	B
well i like well i like different you know different things but uh	3969	B
primarily you know rock and roll	3969	B
oh you know well you i- i really like more of the modern stuff you know but i like the oldies you know they're okay	3969	B
but i you know i listen mostly- mostly to the you know the modern stations	3969	B
yeah	3969	B
uh-huh	3969	B
uh-huh	3969	B
yeah	3969	B
see now i don't like country and western uh	3969	B
i don't like most- you know most of it i don't like but i recently saw that Garth Brooks show	3969	B
and i thought he was terrific and i really thought i mean i thought he was a great you know really wonderful entertainer the way he um he you know he he was very good	3969	B
i don't like twangy no i don't	3969	B
oh he's really not that uh country i mean i've heard him sing stuff that really doesn't sound too you know	3969	B
i don't know	3969	B
yeah	3969	B
yeah right i yeah i have heard him and uh i didn't think he was a country singer you know i	3969	B
yeah	3969	B
uh-huh	3969	B
oh well	3969	B
yeah that's true	3969	B
oh you- really	3969	B
oh	3969	B
um-hum	3969	B
yeah yeah	3969	B
well you know i said let me watch this and see what all the fuss is about i mean everybody's raving about this guy you know	3969	B
and my son is- i have a a son he's uh twenty four and of course he hates country music and he said ma i can't believe you're gonna watch that i said i have to find out	3969	B
my best friend said she likes him i said i if Linda likes him i said he's gonna- not he- he couldn't be all wrong you know i mean he's there's got to be something good about the guy	3969	B
so i watched it and really i i just thought he was terrific	3969	B
i don't know but i mean and his songs uh uh were you know i liked them_1 uh were they weren't that silly country western stuff that you know they used to do years ago you know with with dopey lyrics you know very simple lyrics	3969	B
uh you know they're	3969	B
yeah oh there are but uh uh yeah i think as a whole it's gotten more definitely more sophisticated in the you know in the past few years	3969	B
you know but then i wouldn't listen- you know listen to it uh you know steadily uh you know i wouldn't listen to it at all actually you know i just don't really care for it any you know it as a whole but uh	3969	B
i usually listen to either the uh classic rock it's uh ninety two or or uh one oh two	3969	B
yeah	3969	B
and then my husband loves the oldies you know every time he he gets in the car- the car he sticks on the oldies station	3969	B
yeah	3969	B
uh-huh	3969	B
rock	3969	A
oh	3969	A
oh everything um-	3969	A
um	3969	A
what era of rock and roll or whatever did you prefer-	3969	A
um	3969	A
um i guess we listen to a lot of things um i grew up with the with rock and roll and older brothers and sisters	3969	A
and uh so i would- i remember always being kind of ahead of my	3969	A
peers just because	3969	A
and i think now i listen we listen to a variety of stuff um jazz or country- and western or	3969	A
do you not i don't- i don't like the old the old	3969	A
yeah	3969	A
yeah i	3969	A
i there	3969	A
i think country music i don't like the real old twangy stuff like the	3969	A
you know but that- it has undergone- undergone a lot of change and there's a like there's a guy named Lyle Lovett that he could be considered	3969	A
but	3969	A
yeah see he does- it's more what do they call it	3969	A
sometimes i've heard it called Rockabilly where it's like rock and roll and or country but um but they refer to him you know as a country singer but a lot of his stuff sounds really jazzy	3969	A
um they i mean they they term him as that but i i know well i've watched like the music awards or the country music awards before and they had him on as a new up and coming country singer	3969	A
so it's kind of i mean but there's a lot of people kind of like that that	3969	A
they're they're playing- they're right on the line and you know the	3969	A
at the the i guess the rock and roll side might be so saturated that	3969	A
you know they're trying out this and and we've gone country and western dancing before and	3969	A
but and it when i don't i don't dance i mean country dance that well but	3969	A
you know just watching the people when they get out there is when they start playing the rock and roll music while the band's taking a break	3969	A
you know i mean they get out there and jitterbug and or you know whatever you want to call it	3969	A
uh i don't even know what the alternative-	3969	A
um-hum	3969	A
yeah	3969	A
i saw previews of it and it looked more like a rock and roll concert than a	3969	A
yeah	3969	A
yeah	3969	A
and there's still some out there like that too	3969	A
yeah i do too i do too	3969	A
um-hum	3969	A
um-hum	3969	A
what station- do you listen to radio	3969	A
yeah i switch around	3969	A
um	3969	A
well it's funny because_1 my my father um i'm youngest of six and we all	3969	A
play some type of music interest instrument- instrument and i had a couple of brothers that were in rock and roll bands and	3969	A
so forth so you know he was constantly having to grow up with us so at Christmas or his birthday we're always buying him	3969	A
tapes you know to keep him-	3969	A

in our in our club it's men and women mixed we have a lot of couple's teams	3975	B
well we have the individual uh you weigh in as individuals and then you uh combine your totals as a team so they award prizes for individual and team	3975	B

but um um is it based on the total pounds of fish that you can catch or how do they do it	3975	A
i see	3975	A
um do they have men and women's divisions or is it just all everybody	3975	A
i see	3975	A
so it's the you do it as a joint combination	3975	A
uh-huh	3975	A
i see do you do you fish for a particular team like TI like you were telling me or	3975	A

yeah- that's a lot of fun that is a lot of fun um uh	3975	A
but the king- the king salmon fishing too is fun too we i got to Alaska this year most of the time we just spend fishing around here but	3975	A
that was a lot of fun we got into some really nice fishing	3975	A
uh one night i went down on a river called the Kishloff River	3975	A
and they were catching uh red salmon they're smaller salmon	3975	A
but i started fishing about eleven o'clock at night and i fished until three o'clock in the morning and i must have caught twenty salmon	3975	A
and it was just great it was about every fifth cast you'd hook one and	3975	A
and they were anywhere between eight and twelve fifteen pounds and	3975	A
it just wonderful the the water was very swift and fast and and so uh the fish were even with twenty pound test line i was breaking them_1 off uh you know quite frequently	3975	A
so but that that's probably the best fishing i've been in in my whole life was that night there	3975	A
yep have- have you ever uh	3975	A
have you ever been salmon fishing at all	3975	A
um-hum yes uh-huh you troll with them troll for them yes	3975	A
huh	3975	A
uh-huh	3975	A
well if you ever get a chance to go to Alaska boy uh the the	3975	A
the the biggest problem is you get hooked on it now you know so uh i can't i can't make it next year but in ninety three i'm sure trying to go back and	3975	A
you just it's almost like you can't get your fill of it it is it is so it's just nothing like what we're we've got around here	3975	A
and uh the halibut fishing was great we went out in the ocean one day and actually two days and they got us over a bed of halibut	3975	A
and there was three of us in the boat fishing and probably every five minutes somebody had a halibut on	3975	A
it was great they weren't very big the biggest one we caught that day was thirty five pounds but uh uh it just lots and lots of action	3975	A
and uh so i really enjoyed that	3975	A
just the halibut that's they they bottom fish for halibut but no i haven't have have you	3975	A
uh-huh	3975	A
yes um-hum	3975	A
um	3975	A
i've heard that sailfish are a lot of fun to catch	3975	A
is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody	3925	B
but um	3925	B
other than that i think maybe it just depends on how you define honesty	3925	B
um-hum so they're saying that government officials would tend to be power seekers but-	3925	B
right yeah but i think maybe a lot of them um say the more honest ones who are still looking out for themselves it may be more a matter of	3925	B
not what can i steal while i'm in office but how many friends can i make while i'm in office and you know how good a name can i make for myself and so forth	3925	B
so i guess it would be like anything else the president of General Motors probably has the same	3925	B
i think i'm	3925	B
i think a little more honesty in campaigns would be more to the point if you knew what you were getting when you voted uh yeah	3925	B
yeah they say you get the government you deserve	3925	B
um-hum	3925	B
it's hard to imagine	3925	B
yeah and it almost seems like in order to avoid uh some of this scandal you would have to have the kind of life that you would only find in a say in the Bobsy Twins or something like that	3925	B
so you're taking a government course at what at the university	3925	B
oh okay	3925	B
well they've got laws against cannibalism- cannibalism but that didn't stop that guy in Milwaukee did it	3925	B
actually i think other countries may have it worse uh the Japanese government is always having a some kind of a scandal usually involving the Prime Minister or people very close to him it's so uh	3925	B
yeah i've been around to a few other countries and i uh i- i have not found one yet that i would rather live in i think uh	3925	B
-okay	3925	A
i think the first thing they said i've written this down so it would is it possible- do you think it's possible to have honesty in government	3925	A
or an honest government	3925	A
yeah	3925	A
right that's a good point	3925	A
that's an interesting- yeah that's interesting i had read something one time and it was just applying to governments in general it was written many years ago	3925	A
it said that is impossible to have	3925	A
a completely honest system of government because people who choose government for their positions are power seekers	3925	A
and i thought that was interesting	3925	A
it wasn't just talking about our government it was just government in general from times past you know on and	3925	A
right and that would be a next question to ask how many do you think are in there for public- for but because they wanna be of service to us	3925	A
or are they in there for their own gains and personally i feel it's probably there's probably some of each	3925	A
um-hum yeah	3925	A
yeah	3925	A
oh yeah	3925	A
and they talked uh the other let's see third question was how much- how much self-serving for their own gains do you think goes on then they that's hard to answer- i'm sure there's a lot but i agree with you there's a lot in business i think that's just	3925	A
i think that's very normal	3925	A
that we should not expect- i mean i think we put too much on politicians we expect them_1	3925	A
to only be there to serve us you know	3925	A
yeah	3925	A
that's a problem isn't it	3925	A
it's interesting because_1 i'm taking a Texas government class right now and	3925	A
one of the things i always realize- it's so easy to blame them to blame- a lot of times i think it's our own fault	3925	A
they lie to us because we don't wanna hear the truth and if	3925	A
if they tell us the truth we don't elect them_1 and	3925	A
especially with all this front cover- stuff coming up here lately	3925	A
about people's past and i don't know why anybody would wanna get under that scrutiny anymore	3925	A
because it's i think it's gotten just careless- well we're not talking about issues we're talking about somebody's personal life and	3925	A
and we're getting away from what we ought to be looking at	3925	A
right	3925	A
um-hum	3925	A
uh at uh it's TCJC Texas- Tarrant County Junior College yeah and it's really it's really enjoyable i like it	3925	A
and they also you know ask can we eliminate do you think we could make laws to eliminate all corruption and i don't think we can make laws to eliminate anything anyplace totally	3925	A
yeah but that doesn't mean i don't think making laws will	3925	A
stop it	3925	A
i mean i don't know how many laws you'd have to have i mean you know	3925	A
no sure didn't did it	3925	A
so no i think you can legislate but i think there's no way that you'd eliminated all by legislating and we'd end up with so many more laws that	3925	A
you know i mean i just think that's human nature that you're gonna have corruption	3925	A
in government in business personal life i mean you know	3925	A
right	3925	A
yeah	3925	A
yeah i still believe i get very fed up with government sometimes but when i think about where i'd wanna go	3925	A
you know this is still the best or i can	3925	A
yeah yeah at it's worst i think we've got the best	3925	A
-okay	3956	A
well what do you think about the government providing health insurance for everybody i think they should i know i had a job until let's see	3956	A
a year ago this past December i was working for PIE and they closed and naturally while i was working for them i had health insurance	3956	A
but um for me to try to get it now uh it would cost me like over three hundred dollars a month with the same company that was providing health insurance at at pie	3956	A
right it really is and i think you know i think the God the government should come up with some kind of a health plan or stop these doctors and hospitals from having their prices so high	3956	A
well the thing is you know jobs are so hard to find you know and then what you can get out here in anyhow in the valley where i live at now they don't wanna pay anything for health insurance at all	3956	A
no benefits you know	3956	A
um yes i mean you get a job now and	3956	A
the wages are really low and uh	3956	A
yeah and they don't want uh to pay any benefits	3956	A
so you just you know pray to God that you don't get sick	3956	A
um-hum	3956	A
um-hum	3956	A
no i don't understand that either	3956	A
um-hum	3956	A
um-hum	3956	A
yeah well i know the plan that i had with PIE i could go to any doctor and i could go to any drug store and get my prescriptions filled you know then i just sent cards in and then	3956	A
they would have like a ten dollar deductible per year for my medicine and then they would just send me a check for what was ever over that you know	3956	A
um-hum	3956	A
um-hum um-hum	3956	A
uh	3956	A
yeah that's true that's true there	3956	A
well	3956	A
yeah right	3956	A
um-hum	3956	A
but there's just so many people that can't afford to pay anything you know that people that's on unemployment	3956	A
yeah probably so i don't know but it is it does seem to be a big problem	3956	A
you know i don't know what they're gonna come up with but um	3956	A
i sure wish they would come up with with something	3956	A
and uh like i say and and i'm at the age too where the i'll be fifty seven in June and the people don't wanna hire people this age any more	3956	A
and i worked for my previous company for twenty six years you know so	3956	A
it's kind of hard you know so	3956	A
yeah they'll be calling at my door huh but any how	3956	A
yeah now i I do think the government though is gonna have to do something uh with this problem because it you you know even to go to a little doctor out here just to ask him anything costs you forty bucks	3956	A
you know just for the visit	3956	A
and then he then that's not counting what medicine you're gonna buy and everything else you know and he might tell you well you know now you're gonna have to come back in a week and then that's another forty bucks plus whatever else he decides to do to you	3956	A
good grief that's just almost unaffordable isn't it	3956	B
well i wonder if they couldn't just provide uh interim health insurance for people who are between jobs like that that might be a step in the right direction i don't know	3956	B
uh-huh	3956	B
you mean the uh the employers uh-huh	3956	B
because_1 everybody's competing for jobs	3956	B
well i used to think that universal health insurance was probably the right thing to do i I have to think about it some more now because my doctor is uh actually he's Canadian	3956	B
and uh he told me that there're a lot of uh lot of counts against the Canadian system which is basically the one people are talking about for here i don't understand the arguments exactly he says it restricts your choice	3956	B
of doctors and and so forth i'm not quite sure i understand why government health insurance would restrict your choice any more than private insurance does	3956	B
i mean we're on a private insurance plan right now uh actually uh i have my own business and and we uh our health insurance is through my wife's employer	3956	B
and uh and every year we get another list of what doctor's we can go to and where we can buy or medicine and	3956	B
and uh it changes every year it's always so confusing so uh	3956	B
um-hum	3956	B
well yeah	3956	B
of course the restricted choice in this case is because only certain doctors agree to accept the uh the limits of uh compensation but of course that is restricted choice so	3956	B
i don't think that the restricted choice really uh	3956	B
has to do with the difference between uh public and private health insurance i think it has to do with the the the uh attempt to limit cost doesn't it and uh everybody agrees that we need to limit cost some way so	3956	B
well um i guess the most sensible thing i've heard about this is they they say people are trying you you you have to recognize that if you're going to	3956	B
have the very best health care possible and uh available on demand whenever and wherever you want it then it's gonna be expensive	3956	B
and if you wanna pay less then you're gonna have to settle for a health system that is not quite that uh lavish	3956	B
and uh	3956	B
yeah well what happened to Reagan's safety net anyway did he take that back to California with him	3956	B
using it for a trampoline now	3956	B
yeah they'll be needing you in a couple of years because_1 they're running out of kids down there at the other end and uh	3956	B
well if they're smart	3956	B
uh-huh	3956	B
right	3956	B
we're talking about taxes	3945	B
all right well you	3945	B
that's hard to say you know i think it take a lot for granted you know and it's the- the quick answer i think would be that you pay too much taxes you know but but i think if you think about it	3945	B
um all the highways we have all the uh federal programs we have whether they're good or bad um	3945	B
sure seems like you do get a bang you know it seems like a lot of stuff's going on even though every paycheck a lot of money's coming out	3945	B
um i don't know i don't know it seems like so i used to think that government spent too much and they probably do but	3945	B
you know when you go to your doctor your doctor's private also and uh they're gonna charge you a good buck for whatever they're doing also so well what do you think	3945	B
yeah it's needed	3945	B
yeah i i pay actually state city and federal	3945	B
and	3945	B
yeah well i i just figured it out today i get uh i think my my two week pay is sixteen hundred and eleven dollars or something like that sixteen sixteen something around there and my	3945	B
take home after taxes is about eleven	3945	B
so five hundred dollars every two weeks comes out you know and obviously if you make	3945	B
you know forty thousand dollars a year you're paying ten thousand in dollars a year in taxes and everybody who's in that type of income is paying that	3945	B
you know plus sales tax right	3945	B
sure sure and plus you pay if you buy cigarettes you pay tax on that if you buy beer	3945	B
yeah yeah	3945	B
you	3945	B
you don't have a state income tax in Texas	3945	B
that's so yeah that's not so bad but they still have to get the money somewhere to	3945	B
yeah	3945	B
right	3945	B
same difference	3945	B
what-	3945	B
i- i think it's a i- i don't know i- i think i think it's like private like you said privatization is good because	3945	B
you know when the profit- uh one good thing that could be said for the profit motive is people aren't going to run a business at a loss i happen to work for a city for the City of New York and uh that's the attitude that uh at least my agency takes	3945	B
you know they they when- they take the attitude that uh this is a business	3945	B
and and if you're not going to run it profitably then you're going to be out of business because they are going to privatize it so in that sense you know at my agency and- and it's unique i think for government agencies is revenue producing	3945	B
and we make more money than we than we cost so uh	3945	B
so nobody's ever going to question my salary or anybody else on my staff uh especially my unit because my unit is a revenue producing unit uh there are other	3945	B
you know things that that may i mean look at that i was talking to my father the other day about the NASA program	3945	B
you know he thought it was kind of ridiculous we spend all this money to send these rocket ships up into space and stuff but yet then again they come up with all these scientific discoveries that may help save us sometime i mean i think it was NASA	3945	B
yeah you do learn a lot so you're not you you know you're paying all this money but you're getting something back for it uh	3945	B
you know military spending is the same thing whether you agree or you disagree with building all these bombs and stuff which i happen to have a tendency to disagree with	3945	B
uh you know we are buying protection you know we are protecting ourselves from from uh from other countries that we may be afraid of whether it's right	3945	B
taxes right you think- you think you pay too much	3945	A
is what they said and do you think you'd get what you pay for	3945	A
yeah	3945	A
right	3945	A
well i really feel in some areas that uh i agree i don't think any of us like paying taxes i think in some areas we could do better in a private sector	3945	A
i think it just i've done some reading on this and some- and in some of the areas you know you're lucky to get back a a dime on a dollar on some programs	3945	A
uh but i also know that people to me won't do what they should do to help each other and they wouldn't have so much government if we did	3945	A
and uh we get you know gets forced into it i think socialized medicine's coming which i hate to see but i think because there's so many people without insurance that's what's coming- you know it's coming	3945	A
uh-huh	3945	A
so uh	3945	A
but no i don't probably feel like i get back what i pay now you do you pay state income tax in	3945	A
yeah see here a lot of people think in Texas we're lucky because_1 we don't pay um state income tax but they get us in other ways you know	3945	A
um yeah	3945	A
yeah	3945	A
i think that's another problem	3945	A
uh yeah well that's where they got us here you know every time they need something they up the quote user's fees or the sin taxes you know on beer and such	3945	A
yeah so just because we don't have a state income tax they get us proportionately higher in other areas	3945	A
so i don't know	3945	A
no	3945	A
they get it somewhere and and the problem is with that if you have a state income tax you can take it off you federal	3945	A
so we can't take our any of our sales taxes or anything off anymore because of the reform	3945	A
but that's what they up it they up it on gasoline they up it on um say beer and cigarettes uh	3945	A
user's fee driver's license license plates it all just keeps going up and up and up and they tell us it's not really taxes	3945	A
it is and uh no i don't know i don't know what the answer is to all this i think uh	3945	A
i don't know	3945	A
right	3945	A
right	3945	A
right	3945	A
well that's really unusual	3945	A
right	3945	A
right	3945	A
that we've learned a lot	3945	A
yeah	3945	A
yeah	3945	A
yeah sure	3903	B
well and- when i have my spare time i do enjoy	3903	B
that's right um i do enjoy uh sewing uh hand you know i do some needlepoint	3903	B
and i i've been doing a a picture for my father-in-law that if i i ever get enough spare time he might see it one day and- and some other things i like to do are is music and um also reading	3903	B

yeah i i've not had the opportunity to to go skiing but	3903	B
i grew up in Arizona which had some mountains around it but uh	3903	B
never did get out and ski	3903	B
no i never did didn't have the i guess i didn't have the person out there saying hey let me take you skiing and of course i was at that you know stage of my life where i had to be taken places- places i couldn't go by myself but	3903	B
and then of course then once i got to the age where i could've done it myself i had other interests i guess so	3903	B
oh yeah	3903	B
um-hum um-hum	3903	B
that's right	3903	B
um-hum um-hum	3903	B
yeah i i find that if i i- make i have to make myself to- realize that it's important to get out there and not you know just even to go for a walk is good recreation for me	3903	B
yeah and my youngest daughter is gonna to be starting up soccer so she's real excited about doing that so we'll we'll be busy with that again	3903	B
pardon me	3903	B
well i did with my older daughter and she was in it for a few years but she's got so many interests herself that we had to start eliminating and that was first one to go she still likes her piano	3903	B
and she's in band so	3903	B
so she's got lots of hobbies or uh activities going on	3903	B
yeah	3903	B

and so we we went quite often and uh in- fact my brother still does a lot of skiing and when i lived around in that area my brother would fly in from Chicago and- we would we would go skiing and enjoy that	3903	A

so we're kind of running the gamut yeah but they do it	3983	A
we take several at home i- i take um Skiing Magazine and i take uh Discover Magazine and also uh CD and Stereo Review	3983	B
and National Geographic i think	3983	B
and Boys Life	3983	B
i presume that i do uh i suppose that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth because_1 i do get things from ski associations and things	3983	B
uh at during the year	3983	B
uh not so much that i uh more likely to see those at a ski show or something but um i just enjoy reading about the resorts and	3983	B
where you can go and and new equipment that's come out and so forth some fashions are always in there too	3983	B
probably not uh we already knew we wanted to take one and we just started looking around	3983	B
i may have referred to a couple of them_1 but we went to the ski show and looked at all of the resort information and picked up a lot of brochures	3983	B
and just decided to go to Crested Butte we hadn't been there before	3983	B
it's kind of away from the crowd that's why we chose that one it's supposedly low lift lines but i haven't skied Utah yet but i want to	3983	B
like to go to Sundance and Park City and some of those i understand Deer Valley is nice too	3983	B
well how about you what what magazines do you have at home	3983	B
oh okay	3983	B
does it have uh articles on how to do things as well as equipment that you can buy and so forth	3983	B
well that's good it's good to get use out of one	3983	B
i'm not sure that um in the case of National Geographic i mean i read it but then they just sort of gather dust for a long period of time but then eventually there'll be a school project or something	3983	B
where my son -will need to refer back through	3983	B
forty eight back issues to find you know France or something or whatever it is he's looking for	3983	B
i used to take Smithsonian too and i liked that magazine but it was i was just found myself not ever getting around to reading it you get so many coming in and	3983	B
uh because_1 oh Scientific American comes to our house too i forgot that's mostly my son's but he but i do read it too and so	3983	B
and he takes Games Magazines too Games Magazine which has puzzles and things that he likes to solve	3983	B
you know crosswords and various logic puzzles and things like that and he likes to- to try that and so	3983	B
he does but does get to be a lot of paper though after a while if you don't keep them_1 weeded out they almost take over	3983	B
oh yeah they're just kind of getting started now with there	3983	B
mine is a senior in high school so he's we're kind of at the end of that trail you're just sort of beginning to think about first grade	3983	B
oh okay so you've got a little bit of a gap there between the little ones	3983	B
yes i do uh uh in fact i'm living with three cats at the moment	3967	B
uh one of them is mine one of them is my daughter's and one of them is um partially mine and partially hers i guess	3967	B
uh so um	3967	B
i i'm and i'm an absolute nut about cats um i didn't i used to have dogs and cats	3967	B
um and uh the dogs have died and those original cats have died and we've taken these on and uh i- i just love them_1 i think they're wonderful what about you	3967	B
uh-huh	3967	B
what what kind of dog	3967	B
oh we that's what we had yeah we loved them yeah	3967	B
yeah they uh we had as i say two and then uh gave uh the kids' grandparents one and they got another one and so i mean there've been four sort of in the family around they're sweet dogs	3967	B
yeah how old	3967	B
oh well yes you still- you're still at the puppy stage yeah	3967	B
yes you're right	3967	B
uh-huh	3967	B
um-hum	3967	B
being in heat and all that yeah	3967	B
yeah	3967	B
right	3967	B
right and that's true all ours are fixed too	3967	B
yeah	3967	B
yeah yeah	3967	B
oh really	3967	B
uh-huh	3967	B
yeah yeah	3967	B
what does she do when she loses her patience	3967	B
i mean does she bite or bark or	3967	B
oh that's unusual because_1 they don't usually bite	3967	B
uh-huh	3967	B
right	3967	B
uh-huh	3967	B
uh-huh	3967	B
uh-huh	3967	B
oh really	3967	B
oh my goodness well ours didn't do that ours were much quieter but i had i did have a child at the time and so it may be that the child was sort of all this other stuff for them i don't know	3967	B
uh	3967	B
yes	3967	B
we we we have found that with with all of our pets is that we we've never had just one because we somehow feel like they need another one i don't know if that's a human thought and not an animal thought or what but	3967	B
yeah	3967	B
um-hum um-hum	3967	B
yeah yeah	3967	B
yeah yeah well and i- i think they they can be territorial so you you know have to maybe some of them they're more comfortable with than others but	3967	B
oh they and then they are i mean my son would just you know and and you've heard the stories i'm sure but you know everything from using his little wooden hammer on her head to all sorts of things and	3967	B
um she would just move over you know i mean and that was that was the worst that ever happened	3967	B
-okay well do you have any pets	3967	A
ah	3967	A
we have uh one dog no kids and one dog so um we	3967	A
we have a Golden Retriever	3967	A
oh really	3967	A
yeah she's a mess	3967	A
wow	3967	A
yeah they i mean they go through a a terror a time	3967	A
um she's let's see i guess she's about eleven months	3967	A
so she's	3967	A
yeah	3967	A
and they say they stay puppies for a couple of years so	3967	A
um but she you know we took her through obedience school back when at four four or five months	3967	A
and then we had her fixed at around seven months because i couldn't handle her	3967	A
yes i was so worried the whole time that you know a dog was going to jump the fence and	3967	A
and we decided that we weren't going to breed her and and stuff because there we felt there were enough dogs and	3967	A
and uh	3967	A
so um we went ahead and had her fixed while she was in heat and um	3967	A
but she's she's pretty smart although she you know she gets angry and she's just like a child when she um	3967	A
oh if she's so into what she's doing	3967	A
you know she won't listen to you listen to a command- listen to a command well like um	3967	A
okay i'm trying to think of an example if we're sitting on the couch and she wants to play with you and you say no you know off	3967	A
and then she'll she'll come and stick one paw up and then you take her paw and set it off well she starts doing it and she gets frustrated that you're telling her no so it turns into this	3967	A
this uh almost a fight you know it's like you can't tell me that you know so she starts losing her patience and then we lose our patience	3967	A
um	3967	A
um no she bites a lot but i mean it's sometimes it's it's not angry but sometimes it is	3967	A
yeah	3967	A
yeah they well she's real mouthy you know and that's one thing i think with being retrievers is um	3967	A
you know everything goes into their mouth and and she just wants attention but she gets angry that you're not giving her the attention	3967	A
and then when you you know like like she goes and steals things um oh we have to keep the doors to our bedrooms closed and she'll go in and if she gets in there she'll go in and pick a teddy bear off this little rocking chair	3967	A
and she'll bring it in and she'll kind of show it to she'll stand there until you see her and then as soon as you see her she takes off and it's like come get me	3967	A
yeah	3967	A
yeah i think so and also having other dogs or having other animals	3967	A
no i think it's a animal thought too because they do tend to be pack dogs you know	3967	A
and they because_1 she loves uh we have a neighbor down the street that has a dog and	3967	A
um we there's lots of dogs in our neighborhood but the one down the street she just goes crazy over i mean you'd think that that dog was Elvis or something she just goes hog wild over that dog and	3967	A
and um they have a lot of fun together but she doesn't do that with other dogs it's just that one one friend	3967	A
but we did get her though because we'd heard that they were good with kids so	3967	A
yeah	3967	A

uh the weather wasn't good and it was mostly gambling and that really wasn't what we were there for so	3918	B
but um	3918	B
but that's been a while now where i like to go is is uh Santa Fe	3918	B
Albuquerque and Santa Fe	3918	B

well that'll be fun	3918	B
that'll be	3918	B
yeah	3918	B
well	3918	B
the- southern California and northern California are pretty different except that once you're on the coast of course it i mean being on the coast is just beautiful	3918	B
but	3918	B
but i but i suggest some time you try to get up to San Francisco it's just incredibly beautiful that whole area	3918	B
and driving if you drive if you go from San Francisco and drive north up the Pacific	3918	B
uh coast that way up to up through uh Oregon and and Washington	3918	B
it's just beautiful	3918	B
oh yeah	3918	B
yeah	3918	B
yeah how much time are you going to get to spend there	3918	B
well but that's not bad is it a business trip or fun	3918	B
oh good oh okay	3918	B
oh well that is going to be neat	3918	B
uh you're in college in Lubbock	3918	B
yeah	3918	B
yeah well my son uh was in college in uh near Los Angeles	3918	B
yeah and uh he would go to San Diego Palm Springs is another neat place	3918	B
um there and uh	3918	B
uh oh you get- you- i mean Disney World is there you- up- up and on the you know between the two there's just an awful lot there	3918	B
he liked it uh yeah he liked it a lot he happened to be there during earthquakes and uh	3918	B
so when he was in southern California they had them and then he went to visit San Francisco and was there for the big earthquake there too on his spring break	3918	B
yeah yeah but uh	3918	B
anyways it's you know it's it it's- it's just part of it- it comes with that that and smog but then again it's got weather that's neat all the time and and uh just a lot of of other things that are great so	3918	B
yeah i think you'll enjoy that	3918	B
yeah yeah what about the east coast have you ever been to the east coast	3918	B
no does anything interest you there	3918	B
seeing New York or Boston or Montreal or	3918	B
yeah	3918	B
uh-huh	3918	B
you've never gone there	3918	B
it	3918	B
oh boy do you scuba dive	3918	B
or snorkel or any of that	3918	B
yeah yeah that that and- and do you sail	3918	B
hi	3973	B
well i tell you what my going to work clothes has changed over a period of years i used to work in an office and i would and i thought that i would have to have a lot of clothes	3973	B
because when you go and work around a lot of people for some reason i just felt the need to have a a nice variety and look- and look different	3973	B
now i work in an office in my home and i'm doing office work and i go out and call on people in their homes i sell insurance	3973	B
so i could wear the same thing every single day and it really wouldn't make any difference so and sometimes i do that it's just very very strange and different	3973	B
it's a different feeling i get up and i- i dress as i would go out to an appointment even if i'm going to stay in my office for most of the day or half of the day i just get up and get dressed like i was going you know out	3973	B
but it is this strange feeling to really realize that i really don't need	3973	B
a large wardrobe	3973	B
and um that i can go and and i could wear the very same thing every single day	3973	B
how how do you do what	3973	B
yeah well i- i wear dresses or suits too	3973	B
right	3973	B
right	3973	B
um-hum	3973	B
have you always lived in this area	3973	B
um-hum	3973	B
well it seems to me like maybe fifteen years ago i've always lived in this area and it seems like about fifteen to twenty years ago i would see more of a significant difference in the seasons	3973	B
and um i had a tendency to really buy wool clothes for the winter and really make a a definite change	3973	B
and it seems like the last few years i've had a tendency to even though i want to continue that it's just kind of been a pattern	3973	B
i have i really don't wear my wool clothes any more so i've really had to make a concerted effort to buy lighter weight clothing and and and now most of my suits will wear all all year around	3973	B
well it- i'm i it i just wonder if it's the fabrics or if if there's been that much change in in uh the seasons it seems to me like we're not having as cold a weather in this area as we used to have many years ago	3973	B
right	3973	B
yeah yeah	3973	B
right	3973	B
well i just i had a trip to uh Colorado in December and i took really you know warm clothes in fact i bought a down jacket	3973	B
so that i would have something warm enough and i didn't need anything i mean it just happened to be the week that i was there it was just really nice and pleasant so	3973	B
now i've got a nice new London Fog down jacket that i'll probably never wear	3973	B
unless i go back to to uh Colorado and the weather's bad	3973	B
i remember who you are now	3973	B
yeah i've placed you	3973	B
right right	3973	B
but that's funny too i haven't talked to as many of these calls as we've made i haven't uh talked to anybody else in the Altrusa club before	3973	B
is that right i'll be darned well um	3973	B
yeah well right well um	3973	B
i was trying to think of something else that we might talk about about clothing	3973	B
yes i do too i just don't change uh and a lot of times i come in and in the evenings and i change directly to you know like what i'm sleeping in and my robe	3973	B
that's terrible but i just	3973	B
it seems like there's only a few hours there and i just want to be totally relaxed of course if i know uh if i know i going to go out or run to the store or something well i'll just i'll put on something	3973	B
you know jeans or sweats or something like that but normally	3973	B
i do that about three or four times a week is just come in and	3973	B
hi Vicky	3973	A
uh been wondering what you've been wearing to work lately	3973	A
uh-huh	3973	A
uh-huh	3973	A
that's	3973	A
that must be nice	3973	A
yeah	3973	A
that's right	3973	A
that's neat	3973	A
oh i usually wear dresses or suits i work as an engineer	3973	A
and mine doesn't really vary that much from season to season	3973	A
uh i guess i wear a little less in the summer time a little more in the winter	3973	A
you know or with a suit i- i tend to wear a sweater in the winter as opposed to a blouse in the summertime	3973	A
no no i grew up in New Mexico and spent several years in Ohio going to school	3973	A
uh-huh	3973	A
yeah i think it's a lot of that is because of the fabrics have changed so much	3973	A
yeah well i've been in the Dallas area for about fifteen years and i remember some ice storms and there was nothing you could wear to be warm enough	3973	A
but uh you know i i've got all these woolens from Ohio uh because well i wore a heavy coat and a scarf and gloves and a hat	3973	A
all that stuff	3973	A
long underwear when i was going to classes	3973	A
um-hum	3973	A
yeah well	3973	A
it's hard sometimes isn't it	3973	A
i have i talked to Susan Linnstaedter	3973	A
yes	3973	A
but we didn't get to talk about clothing	3973	A
hum	3973	A
well do you do you i was wondering about when you dress for the day like if you have a club meeting that evening just keep wearing the same thing i usually do	3973	A
yeah	3973	A
i	3973	A
alright	3907	A
okay um so what kind of uh uh piece of property have you got	3907	A
um um-hum um-hum	3907	A
well um i um	3907	A
up here we don't have too much trouble with Crab grass or anything like that um	3907	A
uh we've uh -like we rent the house that we live in but we've got a pretty large piece of uh land that we live on even though very close into Washington DC	3907	A
and so most of the work that we have to do involves mowing the lawn and um uh uh my sweetheart who i live with uh does a lot of uh flower gardening and stuff around the house she gets a lot of pleasure from that	3907	A
hm um well it changes from year to year and she's thinking this year she's gonna get into bulbs and that sort of thing but most of the sorts of things that she	3907	A
uh has grown in the past have been um	3907	A
i guess wild flowers and uh some stuff that our neighbors sort of brings over periodically she's also she likes things like Hollyhocks and uh Peonies and and uh	3907	A
oh let's what else has she got oh the other things she's really into is Morning Glories and uh in the summer time we have Morning Glories just all over the house it's great all different colors	3907	A
and uh she she found them and she said oh i just had to buy them for you but uh we're also really into vegetable gardening	3907	A
actually yeah actually we do we we don't have any um any uh you know varmints or anything like that	3907	A
that that tend to bother the garden but we do have a lot of trouble with insects particularly caterpillars um we've had very very poor luck with uh all of the core crops and like um uh	3907	A
and cabbage and and uh broccoli and cauliflower and that sort of	3907	A
uh-huh	3907	A
well that's um exactly what we've done and you're- you're advice is is dead on in in our experience in fact uh thing that we've found works even better than lime is diatomaceous earth	3907	A
uh	3907	A
yeah well um	3907	A
she went out to some uh pool supply place and and got this huge box of it and it's really it's big	3907	A
well we uh have uh i guess in the last two or three years really discovered that we're really fond of hot peppers and so um	3907	A
we grow tomatoes down one side of the house where we get a lot of sun and then in our regular garden plot this past uh couple of years we've grown a lot of different varieties of hot peppers	3907	A
uh yes which of course are our favorites and uh but we've also grown a lot of real um uh hot uh smaller varieties like {Tais} and um	3907	A
uh	3907	A
yeah yeah the cayennes and we've even grown some little funny uh uh peppers and i've never- i've never been sure one of them_1 i believe is called Chili Tepid and the other one is called Pequine and um	3907	A
they're they're little tiny hot things that we she takes them_1 inside and she dries them and then we eat and	3907	A
they're little green	3907	A
literally pea size peppers they're they're just little tiny guys and they dry up even smaller than they are when they're they're you know fresh food on the um	3907	A
the plant but the plants are just incredibly prodigious they just produce zillions of them um	3907	A
uh all kinds of dishes we like i say we grind them up and um we freeze some of them and then use them in stews and uh whenever we make egg dishes or anything like that we tend to	3907	A
to put some on it it's just incredible with the numbers of ways that we come up to use them	3907	A
but anyway it it's uh it's something that we enjoy immensely and it we get a lot of pleasure out of i love tilling up the garden every year and um uh you know getting out there and just spending some	3907	A
okay	3907	B
we've got a home and uh very large front and back yard we had a lot of Dallas grass what they call Dallas- Dallas grass	3907	B
and others parts of country call Crab grass that- real thick grass and we had a problem with that but we've seemed to've taken care of it how about_1 you	3907	B
um-hum	3907	B
what flowers does she like	3907	B
um-hum yeah they climb too	3907	B
do you have a problem with any type of uh insects or gophers or anything	3907	B
if you uh sprinkle lime on your young plants before they get too big that should help that	3907	B
yeah that works that's kind of hard to get a hold of sometimes	3907	B
what vegetables do you grow the most	3907	B

uh-huh i do it for a hobby	3965	B
and i have my own equipment and i have a jig saw and a scroll saw and	3965	B
uh in the process of getting a router	3965	B
and so i like to cut out my wood and then tole paint on the items that i cut out	3965	B
what kind of things do you like to do with wood	3965	B
uh-huh	3965	B
uh-huh	3965	B
uh-huh	3965	B
oh yeah	3965	B
oh	3965	B
um-hum	3965	B
um-hum	3965	B
uh-huh	3965	B

they are really cute	3965	B
oh that is that sounds really fun i love those well they have a really fancy boutique out here in Ogden Utah	3965	B
and i just got back from that today so if you could get your projects into boutiques oh they are wonderful	3965	B
you could make a lot of money from those	3965	B
uh apparently with that boutique um they take oh what was it	3965	B
twenty percent of the sell price you would put your sell price	3965	B
uh and then they would take twenty percent off of that	3965	B
at the counter and so and then at the end of the boutique which usually runs for a week	3965	B
then they give you what you earned	3965	B
so you have to decide what your price is going to be and then	3965	B
up it twenty percent so you can get what you need out of it	3965	B
so if the customers are willing to pay it then you get a profit	3965	B
they are i- i have seen those those are darling	3965	B
um-hum	3965	B

hum-um	3965	B
they just snap it right up huh	3965	B
oh	3965	B
um-hum	3965	B
oh	3965	B
okay do you uh do any woodworking	3965	A
oh um what do you do for a hobby or for	3965	A
um-hum	3965	A
um-hum	3965	A
well i'm not the one that cuts them_1 out my husband cuts them_1 out but um	3965	A
he likes using the little band saws and jig saws more than the stroll saw because the stroll saw is	3965	A
is a lot slower	3965	A
and then um he's got a router but now he wants a plunge router	3965	A
but anyhow he cuts them_1 out and then i i took a tole painting class	3965	A
to learn how to paint them_1 right you know	3965	A
and what we wanna do is you know make them_1 and then maybe take them_1 to these craft shows or flea market things and see- and see if we can sell some of them	3965	A
but uh i really like it so far	3965	A
and then my neighbor had a little doll made out of wood so i took a pattern off of that	3965	A
and then it's just a wooden doll with a painted face and then you you make the dress for it	3965	A
and you drill holes around the top of the head and you you stick in uh like rope	3965	A
and tie ribbons around it it looked really cute you know so i've got a couple of those started	3965	A
yeah and then uh	3965	A
but as far as wood work that's all we've been doing right now	3965	A
um-hum	3965	A
um-hum	3965	A
what do you do i wonder how you you just they buy them_1 from you or you just give them_1 to them on consignment or something	3965	A
um-hum	3965	A
um-hum um-hum	3965	A
um i see	3965	A
um-hum um-hum	3965	A
um-hum um-hum	3965	A
um-hum	3965	A
um-hum	3965	A
yeah these little things are so cute though you know	3965	A
i	3965	A
i went through some of the books down here at the craft shop you know and uh there's a lots of little things you can get to cut out in fact i just sent to Shop Smith	3965	A
back in Ohio for a rocking horse pattern	3965	A
yeah we well Gene's got one of those too	3965	A
yeah so anyhow	3965	A
yeah well uh he's retired now and um	3965	A
i'm kind of semi retired my company went bankruptcy so i'm drawing my pension from them_1 but i'm still looking for a part time job you know	3965	A
but um he has all day long that he can you know work on this stuff and	3965	A
do do cut outs like that you know	3965	A
and he's got a lot a lot of tools so	3965	A
it's just it's just getting started you know	3965	A
but um these little wooden things they seem to sell really good um i know a lot of people that have gotten them_1 you know	3965	A
my next door neighbor every time she sees something she thinks it's so cute she wants to buy it you know	3965	A
so i'm just hoping that you know that we can get some cut out and painted you know before summer- summer starts because we don't want to have garage sales or anything like that in the winter time you know	3965	A
but um	3965	A
it seems it seems like they go real good you know i mean the country anyhow out here and i live out in the valley and country seems to be the in thing out here	3965	A
you know everybody wants little country pieces so anything that looks like it might be country is what they want you know yeah	3965	A
and uh this little rabbit that i made in uh tole painting class	3965	A
you know is like a welcome it's got a it's gonna have little wooden hearts holding it in its hands and then welcome written on those little wooden hearts	3965	A
and	3965	A
i have uh just uh one dog she's a ten month old puppy um	3954	B
Cocker Spaniel and uh just has been real enjoyable although i think it's just as much work having a puppy around as it was a baby i think	3954	B
really at times i know i can just pick up and leave when i need to although you know which is one thing you can't do with a baby but	3954	B
um you know she's had to be potty trained and and the whole work and uh it's just been it's been nice though	3954	B
because_1 uh we used to have a an older dog and she died at about the the age eleven and was our first real baby as such because_1 we didn't have kids yet and uh	3954	B
so she was our pride and joy and when she she got sick and died it was kind of like an empty hole was in in our family because the girls- our two girls that we now have got real close to her and	3954	B
so it was um hard though to replace her i think it took us a couple of years before we replaced her	3954	B
yeah uh well we were in the middle of moving uh shortly afterwards anyway and	3954	B
we both just didn't feel my husband and i didn't feel like we could take on the the the time that it really takes to raise a dog right to the first you know few months of their life is just as important like it is a kid if you want a good dog afterwards and	3954	B
so we waited and it was about two years before we were emotionally ready to get back into that kind of uh um realm of life so uh	3954	B
oh	3954	B
um-hum	3954	B
yeah	3954	B
um-hum um-hum well it takes our vet probably said	3954	B
seven to nine months	3954	B
uh is the real time you really want to put into them_1 for the training as far as the initial training and he said if you give them_1 just that much then the rest of their life with you is just going to be real nice and and	3954	B
no i never have um she could do better i'm sure on some things and um i know it's still not too late to do that if i really feel like i need to but i just need to give her time	3954	B
um you know working with her and i know how to do that pretty much on my own it's just a matter of disciplining myself on making sure we cover a few things but	3954	B
she knows the real basics she's potty trained and she uh comes when we call her and she'll roll over and she'll sit and she'll put her foot up to shake hands and	3954	B
yeah so i mean she can do some of the basic things that kind of are needed and some for just for frills and uh	3954	B
but i don't have her trained when it comes to staying real good yet and uh not real well about keeping her from jumping but i think some of that's just puppiness too	3954	B
that i'm i'm kind of working just waiting a little bit to make sure i don't push something too too hard on her	3954	B
yes yeah usually-	3954	B
yeah yeah just started doing it with little pieces of cheese and boy the dogs really even at the age of ten i would just still be teaching them_1 new tricks just as long as you give them_1 something to	3954	B
to look forward to i mean they love the hugs and kisses but	3954	B
the the food really seems to meld it all together real fast and	3954	B
um i have for just bits and pieces i've never seemed to be	3954	B
too long with a cat when i was a kid they'd always run away and and then when i was a grown-up i was with- living in in an apartment as a a college student and uh	3954	B
then i got my own first and only cat and she was precious but when i needed to move back out and back to home i had to leave the cat behind so um i've never had a cat for very long but	3954	B
oh really	3954	B
uh-huh	3954	B
yeah yeah	3954	B
that's right that's right	3954	B
um-hum	3954	B
that's right that's right and cats do seem to have the roam the roam of the world so	3954	B
yeah yeah	3954	B
so um well i think you should go back and try to take in a dog again you could even go and adopt one that's already past puppyhood and uh if you're	3954	B
well no a friend of mine had puppies	3954	B
Leslie what kind of pets do you have	3954	A
oh yeah	3954	A
oh uh-huh	3954	A
oh sure	3954	A
i was going to ask how long it it took	3954	A
oh yeah yeah	3954	A
yes it's been about- oh over ten years since i've had a dog i used to have a Dachshund	3954	A
and she died and i just haven't i haven't been ready to make that commitment like you say it's it's important how you treat the animal	3954	A
and if you if you train them_1 properly you really have a nice companion	3954	A
but	3954	A
that's right have uh did you take the dog to obedience school	3954	A
that's always cute	3954	A
yeah	3954	A
yeah did you have pets when you were growing up	3954	A
so that's where you learned to do all this training	3954	A
oh yeah	3954	A
that's right have you ever had a cat	3954	A
yeah	3954	A
i had cats as a kid but i'm i'm not much of a cat person i like to feed birds	3954	A
and feeding you know the the wild birds that's kind of incompatible with having a cat	3954	A
and it's also incompatible with the neighbors and their cats that they let run loose all the time	3954	A
i have to happen to think you have a big responsibility when you own a pet and that is that the world is not your pet's bathroom	3954	A
yes i mean they can get over a six foot fence in a heartbeat so	3954	A
well	3954	A
how did you where did you get your dog did you go to a pet store or	3954	A
all right well we're supposed to talk about cars	3970	B
gosh	3970	B
yeah	3970	B
uh-huh	3970	B
well i'll probably look for a family family type vehicle like a van- mini van or something because	3970	B
i've got two i just uh i've got two young ones so we're we're looking for something that's more family oriented yeah something bigger that we can carry	3970	B
six	3970	B
yeah right	3970	B
right	3970	B
hum that's that's right near me	3970	B
yeah Plano's a few miles north	3970	B
who who does he work for	3970	B
oh really corporate office	3970	B
huh uh i've got a i'm taking a class and uh one of the guys that's in my uh my group that	3970	B
we're doing a group presentation he works for JC Penney	3970	B
three years they're moving their offices to to Plano right right now	3970	B
well that's good	3970	B
well that's great	3970	B
yeah	3970	B
huh	3970	B
that's super	3970	B
yeah well American cars are	3970	B
hopefully they'll i think the unions really screwed American cars up they uh	3970	B
you know the the price of the cars are just more than incomes are because people are you know the people that work at car manufacturers make well the GM plant or	3970	B
or yeah the GM plant that they have down here that they're thinking about closing	3970	B
uh the average worker there makes twenty two dollars an hour and that's you know that's more than a lot of people make salary- you know professionals make	3970	B
yeah	3970	B
sure	3970	B
yeah	3970	B
sure	3970	B
yeah	3970	B
right the car that uh probably the kind we'll get next and	3970	A
i uh	3970	A
i do a lot of driving commute uh i have about uh	3970	A
fifty three miles one way to commute here in Utah but it's uh freeway and it's not bad but uh the cars i've been getting i've got a Toyota	3970	A
it's economical now i've got a Honda now and um and it's a five speed	3970	A
and and for the all the driving i do that uh is the kind i	3970	A
i think i'd probably look at next i'm not sure	3970	A
uh-huh	3970	A
i see	3970	A
a little bit bigger yeah	3970	A
our family's gone we had six children at one time but they've uh they're all gone and so we we can go to the smaller car now but we did have to have- back then it was station wagons	3970	A
as for a family uh when you start taking much with you or going any place you really need a little more room	3970	A
i have a son in Plano Texas who has uh four boys and he got a	3970	A
a van and he really enjoys it	3970	A
is it	3970	A
oh okay well he uh i know i've had several from Richardson	3970	A
he works for JC Penney's	3970	A
uh-huh yes uh-huh	3970	A
yeah he	3970	A
um-hum well good yeah he uh he's been down there going on three three years now i guess uh-huh	3970	A
yes uh-huh they closed at Pittsburgh i think and uh they're moving but it's uh	3970	A
so in fact i was just down there Thursday i was in El Paso and then i had a layover- couple hours uh at at Dallas airport	3970	A
airport and they come out and got to visit with them_1 for a while i got i got a new little grand grandbaby and first time i've seen him	3970	A
but uh	3970	A
i don't know i looking at cars you you they say buy American but i boy of all the people i've talked to that uh	3970	A
seems like they get a lot better mileage i had a hundred and eighty thousand on the Toyota that i had in eighty and that thing i hadn't had any problems at all it was just going strong when i sold it	3970	A
but uh i guess it's just it depends there's lemons in all of them_1 i guess but uh	3970	A
i do too yeah	3970	A
um-hum	3970	A
right yeah	3970	A
oh wow i've been yeah i've been working	3970	A
well i that's it i've been working for uh	3970	A
oh thirty five years for the the government and think i've got a pretty good job but i don't make that much	3970	A
and i've got uh	3970	A
a a degree and everything else you see and i and i don't know hopefully you you'd think that if they were making that kind of money they would try to have a little pride in	3970	A
in uh the product that they put out so it is a good car but	3970	A
uh my family's bought uh my sister bought uh a a Buick paid twenty thousand dollars for it she's had nothing but trouble with that thing	3970	A
and you know you pay that kind of money you should uh it should be trouble free at least for fifty- fifty seventy thousand and then	3970	A
and uh she's had it in the in the shop- garage and shop and she called today and said oh it's uh leaking oil out of the head gasket she's only got about twenty thousand on it	3970	A
so she's got to take that back in and have them_1 work on it but and i and i think it from what i can hear it's just because they uh	3970	A
they don't take the pride that uh the Japanese do or something in in their work or workmanship that when something comes out and their name's on it they want it to to be the best and so i i hate to stay away from American-	3970	A
well they they don't seem to discipline the children like they used to	3982	B
now when i was in school i'm i'm only twenty nine and i- i hadn't been out of college that long but when we were in grade school	3982	B
we you know if you got in trouble you definitely got paddled or you know something something was done and now they can't touch the children	3982	B
well it's really a combination the fact that so many parents refuse to let the school discipline their children and the fact that they let	3982	B
parents or or people file law suits for one thing i have a friend that is a teacher in Houston	3982	B
and she says the kids can hit you kick you stab you and you can not touch them and if you touch them then they can sue you and they can sue- sue the school system	3982	B
i- i think so i think so and and i you couldn't pay me enough to be a teacher in a bad in a bad city	3982	B
and and and our town where you know maybe thirty thousand people there's not a problem	3982	B
oh really	3982	B
yeah	3982	B
it's unbelievable the things and and of course the sweet little kids	3982	B
um-hum	3982	B
um-hum	3982	B
well yeah and the fact that they're not putting enough money	3982	B
into the schools	3982	B
you know and they don't even have adequate facilities is	3982	B
well isn't- isn't that the truth	3982	B
um-hum um-hum and and let the school give them a little more you're right give them_1 a little more support and a little more to work with	3982	B
and as these kids- you know as the kids get older it's it's even harder yeah because_1 then you know their minds are made up as to what they're gonna do by then	3982	B
oh yeah yeah they see no point you know we've gotten away with it this far	3982	B
yeah	3982	B
oh yeah	3982	B
yeah and it just frightens me when i think about having a child and sending them to school where they're they're selling drugs in in grade school	3982	B
i can't imagine i mean we wouldn't even have known what they were talking about let alone take something or you know sell it buy it	3982	B
i- i just can't imagine that it has has come so far	3982	B
that there's little kids dealing drugs and older kids dealing to the little kids and	3982	B
yeah	3982	B
oh my goodness	3982	B
um and when we were little when we went to grade school we lived in Waxahachie and little bitty town you know little bitty school	3982	B
and there was i- i- i just it is beyond my comprehension	3982	B
to imagine grade schoolers with weapons and and gangs	3982	B
and it's just you might as well just have a police file on them_1	3982	B
you know because_1 you you know you you learn who the leaders are and you know what they're doing and it's you can't do anything to them_1	3982	B
it really does	3982	B
because even- even the ones that are that want to will let the other ones bully them_1 out of it	3982	B
well Wendy have you had any uh experiences with your nieces in school to indicate that something's wrong with the school system	3982	A
uh-huh	3982	A
yeah do you think that's the fault of the school system or society or	3982	A
yeah	3982	A
yes	3982	A
yeah	3982	A
so it's really no more a failure of society	3982	A
no	3982	A
i have a friend who's a principal of a Dallas school the stories she tells oh yes	3982	A
within-	3982	A
well the neighborhood that she's in is is very economically deprived and that is reflected in the students abilities i mean they have no support at home	3982	A
so for if you casually looked at it you could say maybe the test scores in that school are bad and and therefore there's a failure of the public school system	3982	A
but when the parents are not interested or don't have the resources or	3982	A
can't even read themselves	3982	A
that sort of thing it it's bound to affect the education of the children	3982	A
oh well	3982	A
i just wonder where all the money goes i mean my	3982	A
my taxes are exorbitant	3982	A
and i- i- i don't think you solve problems too much by throwing money at it i think you have to get the parents interested and have to get the community support and that sort of thing	3982	A
oh i'm sure it is i'm sure it is	3982	A
that's right but again society's uh influences i think can affect how well the students perform more than this than what the public school is or is not doing	3982	A
i mean certainly drugs and and peer pressures of that sort	3982	A
can again make the students fail and therefore look like that there's something- something deficient about the public school system	3982	A
isn't that scary	3982	A
that's right but then then again that's something that that's very difficult for the schools to try to control	3982	A
this principal i know does the best she can in terms of dealing with students this is a grade school students who are members of gangs	3982	A
yes students who carry weapons to school	3982	A
oh yeah	3982	A
that's right	3982	A
that's right but when there are disruptive influences like that in the school i think it makes it especially difficult for the children who want to learn	3982	A
favorite type of music or musician or any	3988	A
do you	3988	A
uh-huh	3988	A
uh-huh	3988	A
oh i i'm very uh i'm very varied as well i uh	3988	A
i don't think i've	3988	A
ever met a type of music i don't like except for uh maybe you know heavy metal and that	3988	A
yeah	3988	A
yeah	3988	A
yeah i don't enjoy rap too much either that that doesn't appeal to uh uh my ears	3988	A
uh-huh	3988	A
huh	3988	A
oh	3988	A
um-hum	3988	A
um-hum	3988	A
um-hum	3988	A
uh-huh	3988	A
oh	3988	A
uh-huh	3988	A
oh gosh	3988	A
uh-huh uh-huh yeah sure	3988	A
uh well um i- i listen to uh specific most- most most likely i would be listen to uh jazz or classical music um i	3988	A
in college i took uh a four years of classical guitar and i played in the in the jazz combo all four years i played guitar for the jazz combo so uh that's where my two	3988	A
my two listening enjoyments are but- but you know jazz can get on my nerves after a while uh you can't just listen to it you know to uh	3988	A
especially a lot of the deeper stuff you just can't listen to it for enjoyment unless you're	3988	A
yeah unless unless you're playing it just it just doesn't do anything	3988	A
uh uh blues are okay i- i tell you i do like um i grew up on blue grass music my dad is a big blue grass fan and so um	3988	A
i wouldn't have admitted it when i was in high school but i- i i really do like it a lot so i	3988	A
no it doesn't it doesn't	3988	A
yeah uh they've all got you know the real screechy electric guitars now and	3988	A
yeah	3988	A
uh-huh	3988	A
uh-huh yeah i- i grew- yeah i grew up on him	3988	A

sure	3988	A
uh-huh	3988	A
um-hum	3988	A
um-hum	3988	A
uh-huh	3988	A
yeah something like that it was last last uh last year wasn't it	3988	A
i don't really have a favorite type i like uh a lot of different types of music	3988	B
yeah i have a a tape collection that i like to listen to uh cassette tapes but it's pretty varied yeah how about_1 you	3988	B
that's exactly me the acid rock or the heavy metal even some of that i like okay but not mostly as a general rule i don't care for that at all	3988	B
well as far as the rap goes i think there are a few artists that appeal to me	3988	B
themselves and i like some of their songs but as as i agree as a general rule i- i wouldn't choose rap either	3988	B
but i- i like to listen to uh what you might call pop easy listening country western jazz uh classical um i- i like-	3988	B
like uh Billy Holiday i really love to listen to her and uh i even have a a tape of Lady Smith Blackman Bazo	3988	B
and well i mean they're very harmonic they really are	3988	B
so they're interesting to listen to you might try that how about_1 you	3988	B
oh yeah	3988	B
it it's too um uh you have to concentrate on it it seems	3988	B
what about the blues or something like that	3988	B
uh-huh	3988	B
i- i like some of it um as far as like the country- what they now call country western it doesn't sound like the old country music at all does it um some of it sounds more like pop music	3988	B
oh nah i don't care for that if if i'm gonna listen to today's country western i have tapes of like Randy Travis and Clint Black and i even liked Jim Reeves you know and	3988	B
or uh what what Meryl Haggard and Faron Young that type of country western music is what what i like to listen to Asleep At The Wheel	3988	B
uh Sons of the Pioneers you know stuff like that	3988	B
um and i like sound tracks a lot yeah it- it seems like you get a lot of original music that way	3988	B
i mean you know think about like the Twin Peaks and stuff like that that's just real recent	3988	B
uh things like that i like to listen to um i like instrumental things	3988	B
um i have some Spiro Gyro tapes	3988	B
oh they're wonderful i love them i have some Dulcimer music i mean like i said that that's pretty varied	3988	B
uh Al Jarreau he's somebody i like he's pretty kind of jazz inspired but but still kind of pop too	3988	B
oh yeah and you know what i like the most about him is i've gone to see him in concert and he always he looks like he's having fun	3988	B
i mean some people sing and they have their faces all contorted like it hurts them or something	3988	B
but he looks like he's having a good time i mean he's up there moving around and smiling like he's happy and and like all he wants to do is is make the audience enjoy it too	3988	B
and he he's real fun to listen to	3988	B
um Bonnie Rait i like her a lot um in fact when ever she won her big Grammy i think there was like five of them_1 or something was was it five or six-	3988	B
yeah last year or the year before i can't remember but um i was listening to a particular radio station and and the one DJ said who the heck is Bonnie Rait and why does she deserve five Grammies	3988	B
well let's see my last home repair i put an office in my garage i uh took down one of my uh uh two car garage doors and i uh	3923	B
i made an office out of it and uh the funny thing was	3923	B
um it- i i didn't think i needed a permit	3923	B
you know because i wasn't yeah i wasn't changing the the looks of the of the outside	3923	B
and uh so oh well what they did was i- i called i'm a contractor myself and i'm i'm a roof contractor so	3923	B
uh i went down and got some permits from some uh roof work that we were doing	3923	B
and i uh i talked to them_1 about my you know my garage	3923	B
and uh so they said well you need to get a permit for this and that and you know electrical and all that kind of stuff so they here's the funny thing they said- they uh	3923	B
they wouldn't give me the permit because they needed a uh pre inspection	3923	B
okay so they came to do the pre inspection and they they didn't pass it because i didn't have a permit on site	3923	B
oh we're i'm still in my office and they- i still don't have one and no huh	3923	B
uh yeah yeah	3923	B
so it's it's quite comical in fact um i'm starting in my i- i'm actually not starting my bathroom but i couldn't help but start at my bathrooms i uh taking a shower one day i i uh	3923	B
put my hand on the on one of the tile walls to support myself	3923	B
and put my hand right through	3923	B
well um yeah i think i yeah- yeah here in in Plano that's uh yeah	3923	B
it's pretty strange	3923	B
uh-huh	3923	B
is that right well here yeah even- even uh even just putting uh little uh uh patio outside you have to have a permit	3923	B
yeah it's it's pretty strange	3923	B
yeah	3923	B
yeah you have uh i- i think things you know are are different from city to city or from state to state but	3923	B
oh	3923	B
yeah well i i think my neighbor was a little bit uh put out because he came over to you know he he asked to to help me	3923	B
and he's pretty busy guy i thought anyway and i said well i've i've got my guys from work they're gonna to come over and do most of the work you know i said i appreciate your your asking but	3923	B
it was funny because right the just the day after he called	3923	B
yeah you know i i guess i should have let him come over and	3923	B
and did my garage i mean i wouldn't -have mind but i you know i thought he was he was pretty busy and	3923	B
wouldn't have time to do it	3923	B
but that's how things are	3923	B
no actually um	3923	B
we do um yeah well we- we don't install we we do mostly repairs we do some uh reroofing with built up roofs	3923	B
and uh but we do repair uh metal roofs	3923	B
yeah	3923	B
uh-huh	3923	B
we do that yeah	3923	B
uh we do work we do mostly commercial stuff uh and we do work on a lot of metal roofs but we we don't install them_1 we just uh uh repair them_1	3923	B
uh-huh	3923	B
uh i'd be real careful extreme temperature changes uh affect the metal roofs	3923	B
it- it expands and retracts and um	3923	B
just	3923	B
yeah	3923	B
you go ahead and tell me about your last home repair	3923	A
a building permit yeah	3923	A
um-hum	3923	A
oh he turned you in huh	3923	A
huh	3923	A
did they fine you or what uh	3923	A
okay_1	3923	A
um-hum	3923	A
um-hum	3923	A
yeah uh-huh	3923	A
oh you're kidding	3923	A
so how'd you finally get a permit	3923	A
you're kidding did you finish it	3923	A
did you finish it	3923	A
yeah that that- that is funny	3923	A
um-hum	3923	A
huh you've got to get a permit even to like remodel a bathroom	3923	A
is- that right	3923	A
{jimminy} Christmas	3923	A
hum i didn't realize they were that stringent i uh -have done a little bit of remodeling on my house i'm i'm an accountant but i sure enjoy um	3923	A
you know messed around and doing some things and i finished a couple rooms in the basement and i built a real nice storage shed on a concrete foundation and and uh i've never got a building permit yeah in fact i	3923	A
i know	3923	A
huh	3923	A
i'm thinking about building a room on my house and i you know i haven't thought twice about getting a permit	3923	A
um-hum	3923	A
-well i'm not sure i think i'm supposed to have one i just never have gotten one	3923	A
maybe my neighbor'll turn me in too	3923	A
uh-huh	3923	A
um-hum	3923	A
is that right- huh	3923	A
i	3923	A
uh-huh	3923	A
yeah	3923	A
well that's interesting well i know you don't have any good horror stories about home repair then because_1 you probably uh don't have any problem if you're in the profession	3923	A
um-hum	3923	A
do you install metal roofs	3923	A
or	3923	A
or just the asphalt type shingle	3923	A
uh-huh but but like if you were doing a residential- if somebody a residential person uh house wanted you to come in and reroof their house but you do that kind of stuff uh-huh	3923	A
uh what's your opinion about those i'm my my home's gonna need to be either reshingled or reroofed in the near future we don't have a lot of heavy snow right here in Twin Falls	3923	A
but uh i was looking towards getting a whole aluminum you know or metal or whatever is	3923	A
in in what way	3923	A
hum more so than the asphalt shingles	3923	A
-okay	3921	A
yes i love to fish	3921	A
well it's mostly from the rivers and lakes	3921	A
and yes and from the banks i don't like to go out on boats	3921	A
well it uh down here we usually catch catfish and bass stripped bass you know where i fish and trout up at uh Lake Shasta when i go up there	3921	A
but i like it all except uh really i don't i don't really care that much for the trout i think i had rather have a catfish than i would a trout	3921	A
uh-huh	3921	A
i see well uh like in uh Iowa and Nebraska those little bullheads they look just like catfish huh	3921	A
you know that's what i mean cause i am from Iowa	3921	A
and uh	3921	A
you know we use to catch those little bullheads and that's they look just like baby catfish	3921	A
you know uh did you get to go fishing very often	3921	A
uh-huh	3921	A
uh-huh	3921	A
uh-huh well uh you like to eat them after you catch them	3921	A
because there's are a lot of people that like to go fishing but they don't like to eat them	3921	A
you know	3921	A
yeah i know if i go to a restaurant and order fish it's usually either salmon or uh red snapper	3921	A
you know	3921	A
we skin- uh skin them yeah yeah yeah just cut their heads off and skin them and then i just uh flour them salt and pepper them and cook them	3921	A
i don't put that corn meal on them	3921	A
you know uh	3921	A
that's the way my mother taught me to fry them so	3921	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3921	A
uh-huh	3921	A
yeah well you know i don't think i've ever tried cooking those uh catfish quite that big	3921	A
uh most of them are just the small you know pan frying ones	3921	A
so uh	3921	A
um	3921	A
wouldn't that be something	3921	A
it's a thrill when you get a big fish though isn't it	3921	A
you know	3921	A
uh-huh	3921	A
so when you were when you did go fishing where did you go you moved there from where Nebraska	3921	A
so it was just like the the rivers and uh and the lakes i suppose huh	3921	A
yeah	3921	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3921	A
uh-huh	3921	A
well are you a fisher person are you	3921	B
what kind-	3921	B
great what kind of fishing do you do	3921	B
in California	3921	B
oh	3921	B
well what kind of fish do they have in your neck of the woods	3921	B
uh-huh	3921	B
oh	3921	B
well i i don't blame you	3921	B
i grew up in Nebraska and uh grew up fish cat fishing in the Little Blue River and	3921	B
then uh we moved to uh South Dakota and uh did a lot of walleye fishing on the Missouri River	3921	B
and uh now that we are down here i think a lot of people do uh some bass fishing and striped bass fishing but uh i still uh i'm sort of a catfish man at heart	3921	B
yep yeah they do	3921	B
oh	3921	B
yeah	3921	B
oh yeah i like to fish the only problem is i just moved to Texas so it's been a little over a year now but uh	3921	B
i i'm not quite sure what uh residency is for a fishing license here and i so really i haven't gone fishing for about two years now and	3921	B
it's uh driving me crazy but uh one of these days i will go over to uh Lake Louisville or uh what is it uh Roy Hubbard Lake Roy Hubbard and	3921	B
get some fishing in and get it out of my system for a while	3921	B
well yeah sure you bet	3921	B
well most- yeah most of the time uh if we catch something we'll take it home and eat it um	3921	B
and you're right i i mean i like to fish for trout and they are really uh uh good fighters but uh if i went to a restaurant that probably wouldn't be the first thing i would order if i had a choice of fish on the menu	3921	B
yeah	3921	B
well uh so do you just uh uh skin your catfish or do you fillet them out how do you how do you	3921	B
do you okay	3921	B
yeah	3921	B
no	3921	B
well that's how we do it too uh although we uh use to set some uh trout lines out and we've caught you know	3921	B
fourteen fifteen pound catfish and sometimes those are good to uh do on a barbecue grill	3921	B
and just uh leave the skin on and uh do it with uh butter on uh on an on tin foil	3921	B
and then the skin just basically scrapes right off and uh we're and it really tastes pretty good	3921	B
there uh	3921	B
yeah	3921	B
well i'm hoping one of these days i'll have the opportunity to catch a big catfish like that on uh a rod and reel but uh so far it's just been on uh on the trout lines so	3921	B
yeah	3921	B
yeah and uh well and up in uh South Dakota on the in the Missouri River there we've uh tied into a few northern pike and uh	3921	B
they really uh in- in the in when the water is cold they are very slow moving fish but in the summer time they'll uh give you a run for your money	3921	B
uh-huh yeah	3921	B
in	3921	B
in Nebraska	3921	B
uh yeah most of the time uh we just fished uh in the river although there were a lot of sand pits and things like that that we could fish in	3921	B
and uh a lot of them ended up being close to the river so if the river ever uh flooded you know then obviously they'd dump some catfish and	3921	B
bass and stuff into the into the ponds and the sand pits and	3921	B
so we'd do a lot of fishing there too but uh	3921	B
South Dakota didn't really have much for	3921	B
well isn't that the truth-	3997	B
well i just started going back to aerobics	3997	B
it's three times a week and	3997	B
it just the minute you get off work you got to run over there change clothes	3997	B
do that come home take a bath you know get cleaned up and there's always people at our house	3997	B
and things going on and it it's hard it's hard to fit it in and i'm not one of these that loves aerobics anyway	3997	B
we're going snow skiing in March so i'm wanting to get in shape before we went so that i wouldn't just fall over dead	3997	B
up there but i thought as soon as this is over i am quitting	3997	B
i just	3997	B
no and i you feel good after you you know you work out but it's always a mental chore for me to get psyched up to go	3997	B
but once i get there i'm all right	3997	B
oh i know i saw that i want that	3997	B
oh you're kidding	3997	B
it is	3997	B
yeah and the but the fact that all the movements that they do are exactly what you need to but the fact that it's songs that you like and movements that are not so hard	3997	B
um-hum	3997	B
um-hum	3997	B
yeah	3997	B
that's the only video i have even considered buying	3997	B
i think so i think they're around twenty dollars apiece aren't they yeah	3997	B
um-hum	3997	B
i know	3997	B
i have a friend that lives in Dallas and she every day goes to some gym and they work out on all kinds of machines and the whole bit and i just thought you must be kidding	3997	B
and then they got to a while they'd go before work	3997	B
may be work out for an hour i thought y'all are eaten up with it just yeah just eaten up with it but they're young and they're single and	3997	B
that kind of stuff um-hum and i said well that's what's the matter with you get married and you won't care	3997	B
really i don't have any children i all my friends do i've got one that the minute she had the baby she lost every bit of the weight	3997	B
and was right back a skinny little thing again and i thought you make me sick	3997	B
but she's young she's about twenty twenty two	3997	B
and i thought well that's what it is you're just you're just a child	3997	B
um-hum some people i don't know i've got another friend that i'm twenty nine and she's twenty nine	3997	B
after she had her son she said i was just too busy to eat	3997	B
she she had a two year old and then she had a had another one and she says i just don't have time to eat she says i one i'm fooling with one and then i'm fooling with the other one	3997	B
and she said i just at night time i think boy i don't think i've had anything eat today	3997	B
and that's how she lost hers yeah	3997	B
well really	3997	B
um-hum	3997	B
um-hum	3997	B
well yeah	3997	B
uh-huh	3997	B
that was always fun	3997	B
oh	3997	B
yeah we're just getting in shape for ski trip	3997	B
my husband is	3997	B
-okay well	3997	A
i don't exercise on a regular basis i think about it a lot	3997	A
but i chase an eighteen month old and i think if i do much else i'm gonna fall over	3997	A
so	3997	A
that's um i like exercising i feel good when i do it	3997	A
but i find it real hard to fit it into a schedule	3997	A
uh-huh	3997	A
um-hum	3997	A
yeah	3997	A
oh yeah	3997	A
no	3997	A
um-hum	3997	A
it's not going to last long huh	3997	A
yeah	3997	A
yeah well now i did find uh a video that i really liked and i just can't quite convince myself it's worth paying for yet	3997	A
and it was Richard Simmons Sweating to the Oldies	3997	A
it's a lot of fun my son likes it	3997	A
no my girlfriend and i used to work out to it right before Christmas and we put him in her playpen at her house and he thought that was the funniest thing to watch us dancing around because_1 it's more like just dancing	3997	A
than anything else	3997	A
yeah	3997	A
well that's true and the only other thing about that was that they weren't maybe songs that i was real familiar with	3997	A
but i could feel it it it wasn't that you couldn't feel that it was working	3997	A
because i'm out of shape and i could feel it working but i enjoyed what i was doing so much that it was pretty much one of those i didn't care that i was really working out	3997	A
well and it's one of three he has Sweating To The Oldies Two and Three and i haven't seen the other two but i really think they'd be a lot of fun to have	3997	A
yes even at a discount store i've looked at them and they're about eighteen ninety for one of them so uh that's why i say i can't quite	3997	A
i can't see paying some one to enjoy watching me sweat and uh not- and not enjoy myself	3997	A
that was the other thing about working out	3997	A
uh-huh	3997	A
um	3997	A
oh you're kidding	3997	A
you people are crazy	3997	A
oh well there's half of it right there	3997	A
have those babies and it changes	3997	A
uh-huh	3997	A
uh-huh	3997	A
yeah oh i agree i agree	3997	A
uh-huh	3997	A
well that's a part of it i bet because i'm well i'm twenty nine now i just turned twenty nine	3997	A
and i haven't lost hardly anything and my son's a year and a half	3997	A
wrong	3997	A
well there's no way no there's no way i i make time to eat	3997	A
because when he particularly his age now he and i eat the same things and if i'm not eating he doesn't eat very well	3997	A
so	3997	A
i have to eat	3997	A
<b_aside> you did so good on the others you keep doing that one <e_aside>	3997	A
he's stripping Crayolas	3997	A
yeah	3997	A
oh yeah	3997	A
well what else were we supposed to talk about oh	3997	A
why we're motivated to do what we do	3997	A
and your motivation was your ski trip	3997	A
uh-huh	3997	A
okay this subject is magazines what do you like and what do you dislike about magazines	3944	A
that's my main complaint on magazines too and i get magazines some of them_1 are just pictures and advertisements	3944	A
uh Life magazine is like that i quit subscribing to that it's just uh magazine i mean pictures and um	3944	A
advertisements what is your favorite magazine	3944	A
um-hum you like to do remodeling in your home	3944	A
for instance what are you doing now anything in particular	3944	A
well i like Reader's Digest we get that and my husband subscribes to Scientific American i think he's a frustrated doctor	3944	A
because he uh reads constantly we have a person in our area	3944	A
that uh his little girl was diagnosed as as terminal and uh he came across an article about leukemia so he had me fix up the	3944	A
make copies of it and give it to them_1 and tell them_1 that there's hope for her and all this	3944	A
well right now i i dropped People but we have uh Better Homes and Gardens Scientific American and um	3944	A
uh what's the other one i think it's Ladies' Home Journal or Redbook something like that	3944	A
did you enjoy it	3944	A
yeah	3944	A
do you get those as subscriptions	3944	A
hm	3944	A
when my husband was younger he liked Outdoor Life he thought that was a pretty good magazine	3944	A
i don't know my	3944	A
it might not be because_1 it's been a while	3944	A
what's that	3944	A
with the scratch and sniffs	3944	A
oh	3944	A
what magazines are those i don't know if i've ever seen one in mine or not	3944	A
oh i don't get those	3944	A
hm	3944	A
do you have any pet uh magazines	3944	A
do you like the Reader's Digest when the in their uh theirs they're kind of interesting they have the uh	3944	A
oh	3944	A
oh	3944	A
so you get away easy huh	3944	A
yeah	3944	A
yeah i like that too sometimes you can get a pretty good uh	3944	A
yeah doesn't that blow your mind away when that happens	3944	A
that's something	3944	A
and-	3944	A
like what do you mean	3944	A
well i like them_1 because i can read them at my convenience and i don't like a lot of the ads i get in them_1 especially those stupid cards that fall out of them all the time	3944	B
oh i like the magazines like uh the home remodeling magazines like Home or Decorating and Remodeling things like that because_1 you can see what other people are doing with their houses and maybe you could do it in yours	3944	B
yeah we've learned how to do a lot of things on our own	3944	B
uh no not right now um i haven't gotten any magazines that have shown me anything lately	3944	B
what other kind of magazines do you like	3944	B
hm how many different kinds of magazines do you subscribe to	3944	B
i used to get People but it cost too much so i had to quit taking it	3944	B
uh sometimes they'd have good articles but a lot of it was kind of uh	3944	B
a lot of fluff and not a lot of substance and it and it like i said it cost a lot of money because_1 i think they came every week or something like that so it was a lot higher than the monthly magazines	3944	B
my husband likes to read sports and fishing magazines all the time that's pretty boring to me	3944	B
oh he gets one to uh fishes hm what's it called Stream- Field and Stream that's what he gets	3944	B
but that's the only one but he'd get more if he could	3944	B
i don't think i've ever seen that one i don't know if they still do it or not	3944	B
you know what i really hate about magazines is those smelly cards that have perfume or cologne	3944	B
the- well the ones aren't they're not scratch and sniff anymore the the one- kind i'm talking about you open it up and	3944	B
the fragrance is just there it's like a fold that's glued shut but usually	3944	B
when you get the magazine the whole magazine smells like that fragrance and you can't get the smell out and it and sometimes it makes you have a headache because_1 it's so strong	3944	B
well they came in People and a lot of times if you buy like the fashion magazines the Cosmopolitan or the Glamour or or Elle those type have have them in	3944	B
i don't get them_1 on a regular basis but sometimes i've bought them	3944	B
no we we have two dogs but no magazines come in uh regarding pets at all	3944	B
i like Reader's Digest but i usually borrow my parents' of that because they get it so i didn't have to subscribe	3944	B
yeah- well a little bit	3944	B
but i like the they're interesting and plus i like to read through the in the anecdotes and the jokes and things on those	3944	B
sometimes the book excerpts are good too but mostly i like the other articles	3944	B
and i like the vocabulary section in that	3944	B
and sometimes the real definition is something totally of opposite of what you thought it was	3944	B
sometimes i like the true to life stories but sometimes they get too melodramatic	3944	B
it seems-	3944	B
you think that that spot testing for drugs is is well like it said	3996	B
you think it should be done permissible and where do they draw the lines	3996	B
yeah	3996	B
what's really bad is you know that i work for TI and TI does it	3996	B
that's no problem i'm i don't take drugs anyway i don't have any problem with that but	3996	B
our own defense system doesn't do it	3996	B
the government doesn't do spot testing for not only for you know the FBI and defense systems and everything else but they impose it upon the on the	3996	B
standard public and i	3996	B
i really don't care one way or the other i think it it prevents a lot i think guys aren't so willing to take drugs at work anymore or do drugs and go to work but	3996	B
yeah yeah there well there even at TI there was there was quite a change when they come out with drug testing i think it's a great deterrent	3996	B
and uh	3996	B
i know a girl that works for Town and Country and she had they just they go around and they just pick a store	3996	B
one store in the city a month and they go down and do drug testing on all of its employees from the manager all the way down	3996	B
so there's no discriminating there you know they're not they're and even like TI now TI if you go out	3996	B
and they test you positive for drugs first they send you to drug rehab they don't just throw you out the door and fire you so you know they're not out hunting heads	3996	B
but i think it should be done	3996	B
across the work spectrum i don't i don't disagree with it i think it's a good thing to have but i think it should be done across the whole work spectrum i don't think that one company should do it and the other company not	3996	B
i don't think that TI should necessarily need to do it when the federal government doesn't	3996	B
you know it it it ought to be standardized somewhere somebody has to	3996	B
you know and and they we got into a big discussion about it at work about	3996	B
against being against- unconstitutional and against somebody's privacy rights but that you know i don't want some guy hopped up on drugs next to me working on a machine i might get my head cut off	3996	B
you know	3996	B
yeah	3996	B
yeah	3996	B
yeah i seen that too	3996	B
but i agree with it	3996	B
you know i think it should be done i think it should be done everywhere i don't think it should just be done at one company or another	3996	B
you know like you said not at McDonald's but you know there's nothing at McDonald's except	3996	B
a deep fat fryer full of grease that somebody can stick their hand into or you know	3996	B
i don't think drugs have if if	3996	B
i have no qualms if they wanna take drugs that's their problem it's not mine but i don't want them_1 around me or near me or working with me or	3996	B
you know not while they're hopped up i don't want a drunk there either	3996	B
i don't want some guy in there that's	3996	B
drunk	3996	B
working next to me either so	3996	B
and they're all drugs so	3996	B
i agree i think it should be done i think it should be done	3996	B
all the everywhere i don't think it should be done in one place and not another i think it should be done i think it should be done every time a person needs to	3996	B
well you know changing jobs you have to to get into TI you have to take a urines test- urine test anyway and they won't hire you if you test positive but once you're there	3996	B
and they they they test you positive they'll at least send you to drug rehab or some kind of counseling anyway	3996	B
and i think it's working i think it's doing pretty good job	3996	B
so	3996	B
um-hum	3996	B
yeah most of your major companies do now	3996	B
well that's good you know i	3996	B
it prevents a lot it's a great deterrent whether or not it	3996	B
helps in the long run nobody knows but	3996	B
it works pretty good	3996	B
all right	3996	B
uh-huh nice to talk to you-	3996	B
yeah it woke me up but that's okay	3996	B
see you later bye bye	3996	B
-okay	3996	A
well i think that	3996	A
i think it should be done	3996	A
yeah	3996	A
uh well i think at some places like	3996	A
not necessarily at McDonald's but	3996	A
at plants- at bigger companies	3996	A
yeah	3996	A
but there's a lot that do	3996	A
yeah	3996	A
yeah	3996	A
yeah	3996	A
yeah	3996	A
true	3996	A
yep	3996	A
that's why i think it's good to do testing not only when they get hired but also along the line sometimes	3996	A
because_1 a lot of people will	3996	A
have have ways of like faking the test or you know they just don't do it for a while to take the test to get the job and then they'll start up again	3996	A
yeah	3996	A
yeah	3996	A
yeah	3996	A
yeah	3996	A
yeah	3996	A
yep	3996	A
yeah	3996	A
yeah	3996	A
i went down to Wal-Mart a couple of years ago to try to see about a job and they wanted me to take a drug test	3996	A
hm	3996	A
yep	3996	A
okay	3996	A
well thanks for talking sorry to wake you up it sounds like i did	3996	A

yeah	3994	A
yeah	3994	A
yeah	3994	A
do you sing at choir at your church yeah	3994	A
yeah i tried out for choir when i was think in the seventh grade and they wouldn't let me in	3994	A
so i never tried again	3994	A
yeah	3994	A
i never really learned the music or anything i never learned i got right to where i was figuring out where all the keys were on the piano and that's about when i quit	3994	A
yeah	3994	A
yeah	3994	A
yeah	3994	A
of course parents always do they're nice that way	3994	A
um	3994	A
well i don't	3994	A
to so you listen to kind of church music gospel	3994	A
oh yeah yeah	3994	A
oh yeah	3994	A
oh yeah the geezer music as i call it yeah my boss listens to that we listen to ninety seven point nine and that's his station so i call it the geezer music	3994	A
well i listen to like ninety seven point one you know more	3994	A
it's more um oh i don't know how to explain it kind of pop you know rock yeah well not hard just kind of	3994	A
huh yeah	3994	A
it's not too hard it's you know but it's not enough to put you to sleep	3994	A
which some of the songs on KVIL can	3994	A
oh yeah got the bumper sticker too	3994	A
uh someday	3994	A
okay	3994	A
okay bye-bye	3994	A
all right well do- do- do you play any musical instruments or	3994	B
oh well	3994	B
everybody sure i- i started when i was in uh third grade and i've i still play the piano as of today yes i do	3994	B
but then again i was also in uh the marching band i played the drums i played the clarinet i played the trumpet	3994	B
uh you know whatever and so and i and i still sing and i sing in the choir today so i enjoy- i enjoy the music it it gives me an out	3994	B
and i always found that like for my playing the piano when i was depressed and didn't have anything else to do and there was no one to play with i could always go play with the piano you know so how long did you play	3994	B
three months	3994	B
i was gonna say you- you- you got as far as the uh Chopsticks huh	3994	B
oh the woodchuck song and your mother saying and all those the money that we spent for those piano lessons this is all we got was the woodchuck song	3994	B
oh bless your heart did you ever did you ever just bang on it or do anything with it at all	3994	B
oh okay but i mean can you play anything on it other than the woodchuck song no	3994	B
oh okay	3994	B
i can- i can- i can still read music if i'm lucky if i if i work real hard i can still barely read the music but see i played the piano from the third grade all the way through high school so	3994	B
i played concertos uh concertos and other stuff but i got to the point where i wasn't really reading music i was memorizing music and so because of that	3994	B
i can't read music as well as i used to but anyway but i- i enjoy it though i find it to be a good out and i still enjoy the marching band and i still enjoy the singing in the choir so	3994	B
yes i do yes i do that's in fact that's about the only musical thing that i still do is sing in the choir	3994	B
well i sing in the choir i don't know if they want me to or not but at least i do sing in it that's pretty good well	3994	B
i was at i actually went to University of Texas at one time thinking that i would become- be a musician i wanted to be a high school band director	3994	B
but after one semester of it i said nope no	3994	B
this isn't for me i enjoy it but not for profession no and besides that i kind of got- learned i wasn't really that good so i gave up course my mom thought i was but hey you know	3994	B
oh yes oh yes yes well what else can we discuss- talk about uh	3994	B
no no i- i listen to KVIL yes uh i listen to the radio i like the pop music i like people like Neil Diamond and all all the folks that you're not supposed to like but that's who i go	3994	B
oh the geezer music oh okay well	3994	B
okay now what do- kind of music do you listen to	3994	B
i'm not sure what- what is that	3994	B
rock hard rock	3994	B
not hard rock not- not like the Eagle	3994	B
is that the Eagle okay i know- i know what the Eagle is that's not too hard no	3994	B
true true	3994	B
well course see i listen to KVIL for the contests i mean oh yes oh yes you can't drive a car without bumper sticker and you know they're going to call you up	3994	B
yeah well listen i've enjoyed talking i i'm sure that the switchboard will probably give us that sign off message very shortly anyway so	3994	B
i appreciate it catch you later bye-bye	3994	B
uh you know mandatory public service i obviously believe in public service and you know think it's a good idea i i- i- i'm not sure if they would get	3933	B
the service they anticipate if they force it do you understand what i'm saying i mean you know you're gonna get a lot more commitment a lot more desire a lot more uh	3933	B
maybe quality time effort energy from somebody who really truly wants to be there so although i believe in it i'm not sure requiring it would be the way to go	3933	B
um-hum	3933	B
that's true if there were enough opportunities	3933	B
well that or have something available in that field you know and and when you go to employers then is it really a public service	3933	B
thing or more of an internship you know i don't know	3933	B
i- i definitely agree and i- i had you know some family that did serve in the Peace Corps and i- i always thought it was a wonderful thing	3933	B
um i- i do think that if people have the opportunity to do it it's something that you know they won't forget it enriches your life and gives you like you said a a good understanding of	3933	B
oh well what do i wanna say we take so much we- we take what we have for granted you know we're very blessed in this country and and we take so much for granted because we really don't realize uh	3933	B
how other cultures and other other countries live so i- i definitely agree that it's it's good i just you know it- i- i	3933	B
to to require it i think would take a lot of forethought and planning if you wanna get the type of service you know that you're anticipating that you're hoping for	3933	B
yeah	3933	B
that's true	3933	B
that's true and then i guess i can look around you know i i- automatically when the uh	3933	B
switchboard suggested Peace Corps i kind of like you i thought international or going out of the country and i i look around though and there's an awful lot of public service that could be done within our own communities and our own	3933	B
you know a lot of times people say i don't wanna go somewhere else i wanna help my own community you know United- United Way i want my dollars to work here something like that so that might also be a motivating factor then	3933	B
minor offenses yeah	3933	B
i agree i think that's a very good idea	3933	B
what you said the field you're in what field are you in does it apply-	3933	B
okay	3933	B
so you have to do it in that field actually	3933	B
like if you like you-	3933	B
yes	3933	B
that's true well and it might also make them_1 realize jeez this isn't what i thought it was i don't wanna do this that's a good idea	3933	B
that proposal	3933	A
um-hum	3933	A
that's a good yeah good point	3933	A
um-hum	3933	A
you know what i've noticed at least in our- in my field that that works is to require before a person can	3933	A
enter the school program that they do a number of volunteer hours in that field or in in an environment that's related to that field and	3933	A
that might be more motivating um in relation to what you just mentioned if it were somehow of interest to them	3933	A
i suppose uh that would really require a lot of	3933	A
participation on the part of employers to require a certain number of	3933	A
community- uh community service hours in their area that's	3933	A
um	3933	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3933	A
i really like the idea of young people getting a chance to	3933	A
to do something of a volunteer nature maybe in another country but that that's difficult for a lot of people i guess financially to	3933	A
to manage but it would certainly i think contribute to a person's responsibility and and sense of maturity um to recognize what other cultures and other countries	3933	A
go through in terms of their day to day existence if you're working in Peace Corps for example you're really gonna be able to learn those things	3933	A
uh-huh	3933	A
yeah we really	3933	A
um-hum	3933	A
um-hum um-hum	3933	A
yes	3933	A
it's a little challenging today too to think about being in another country where there's	3933	A
uh potentially political or military problems that are gonna effect Peace Corps workers if a person is volunteering	3933	A
it's one thing because they recognize there's a minimal danger where where they might be but if you're	3933	A
expecting that they have to do it then you- you you perhaps the whoever- the whoever the organization is requiring it does assume some responsibility too	3933	A
um-hum	3933	A
yes	3933	A
um-hum	3933	A
um-hum	3933	A
i- i think it's terrific to have criminals involved in community services and i really like the idea of avoiding jail time for people who are just um um	3933	A
paying if you wanna call it that for minor offenses having them do something in the in the community	3933	A
i i'm an occupational therapist and so it's hospital work that um i know this is true in occupational therapy as well as physical therapy there's so many people who are applying to the schools right now	3933	A
that they require that you do X number of volunteer hours i think it's a hundred or so before you can even be accepted into the school program to become a therapist	3933	A
i believe you do yeah you have to volunteer in a department that that provides occupational therapy or physical therapy if that's the	3933	A
the area you're pursuing i'm sure that there are other reasons for them wanting people to do that because a person may actually get into the program and not have a very good idea of what	3933	A
it is to be an OT or a PT and having been a volunteer they'll certainly see people on the job and recognize well this is really what i wanna do i wanna spend three or four years getting this experience	3933	A
exactly	3933	A
exactly which- which is which is definitely the case in	3933	A
the opportunity to uh	3913	A
talk with someone with my name	3913	A
no there really aren't	3913	A
uh-huh that's interesting well are you uh um involved in any kind of home repair projects right now	3913	A
did y'all have	3913	A
oh	3913	A
um	3913	A
but we haven't uh it's just a stain you know it's not really it's a stain on the paint it's not where water actually leaked	3913	A
uh on the floor- i mean it's not like a hole in the ceiling	3913	A
oh	3913	A
uh	3913	A
uh	3913	A
is it like a is it like a popcorn ceiling or what's the texture	3913	A
oh uh-huh	3913	A
huh	3913	A
huh	3913	A
well that's probably the easiest thing to do i guess in that case	3913	A
wow	3913	A
huh	3913	A
well	3913	A
and it looks nice	3913	A
uh-huh	3913	A
yeah	3913	A
right right	3913	A
uh-huh	3913	A
well we are in the midst of all that now too we've lived in our house for uh two years and uh	3913	A
my dog it's just uh she's like a child she wants to play as soon as you get on the phone she my dog is trying to uh a fifty pound dog is trying to get in my lap uh anyway uh	3913	A
so we really have not done much to the house we kind of worked on the landscaping outside but	3913	A
but this year we've made uh kind of a list of things we want to do and we devote half of every Saturday to our work projects and then one night a week and uh so right now we are painting our master bedroom	3913	A
yeah i chose a good job so i don't have to help	3913	A
when is it due July	3913	A
so we're we're working on the master bedroom first and then we'll eventually get to the baby's room and you know try to decide what we want to do in there but uh we have the people that lived here before us uh	3913	A
uh the house is about twelve years old and and ouch she just tried to bite me uh but	3913	A
it it's a custom home and it has a lot of neat things to it but they also went i think a cheap route you know that on some things and there's one wall in this bedroom that uh	3913	A
that uh are in one of our guest bedrooms that was painted gray and the rest of the walls are white and it looks like it must have had wallpaper on it	3913	A
and they took the wallpaper off and then tried to re-texture it and it's horrible it just looks like it just rained	3913	A
no there's really not very many	3913	B
uh when i went to school there was probably three	3913	B
you know in various ages but you don't you don't find that name very often	3913	B
uh we just got through having the ceiling in the kitchen touched up	3913	B
the roof we had a lot of rain and the roof was leaking and it went down and had a big spot on the ceiling	3913	B
and we intended to to fix it ourselves	3913	B
and that didn't work so we ended up hiring just uh a handy man and it turned into a huge project for him	3913	B
and he couldn't he tried to match the spot and he couldn't match it and ended up having to do the whole ceiling over	3913	B
uh-huh	3913	B
yeah i think so but we tried just at first just kind of spackling it it's one of those type ceilings this is an older house and we were trying to just repair that and match the the uh texture	3913	B
and we couldn't do that and then	3913	B
it's i'm not even sure what it is it's not like the kind at my mother's house is a blown texture	3913	B
and this is an old older house and it's kind of a	3913	B
sponge is what it looks like to me	3913	B
that they took the uh plaster and kind of sponged it	3913	B
but it's a different pattern and he had so much trouble trying to match it	3913	B
and the paint and everything he finally just had to redo the whole ceiling repaint the whole thing	3913	B
uh-huh	3913	B
but he uh i was surprised he stuck with the price that he had quoted	3913	B
which was just a couple a hundred dollars to fix the one place and then he found out that the beam there was no support to attach his stuff to and it it turned out to be a mess	3913	B
he finally finally got it finished	3913	B
it does i was i because_1 it took several days and i work so he was on his own during the house- during the day and then i would just have to come home and and call him at night and say excuse me	3913	B
this doesn't look good	3913	B
because he was going to let it go if i hadn't said anything at first when it didn't match and stuff he was just going to go with that	3913	B
and i am sure nobody would notice if they come in they don't look up immediately but i noticed but when he fixed it	3913	B
but this the house it belongs to my father-in-law and our deal as far as living here and each month we fix something	3913	B
and we put a deck in and we landscaped the yard and we put new carpeting in and we put new linoleum in and then we had the ceiling fixed and put a new floor in the bathroom	3913	B
and wallpaper but just as soon as you get finished with one job it's time for another one	3913	B
oh well see you chose a good job well congratulations when is your baby due	3913	B
uh-huh	3913	B
well that good it won't be too hot	3913	B
uh-huh	3913	B
uh-huh	3913	B
okay so what do you think of the Giants	3971	A
yeah	3971	A
oh yeah yeah wasn't that something of him	3971	A
yeah that's really a really proud of him though the way he's you know	3971	A
yeah really you know	3971	A
yeah i just don't understand why they're not right up there on the top you know	3971	A
um-hum	3971	A
yeah um i was mostly an A's fan you know i had been to more games at the A's than i have in the Giants	3971	A
because uh i lived in Oakland you know for some time	3971	A
but uh i still like the Giants though you know	3971	A
yeah right	3971	A
yeah	3971	A
um-hum	3971	A
yeah right right	3971	A
yeah	3971	A
yeah right well i prefer baseball- uh football over baseball but uh	3971	A
yeah it's	3971	A
so add hot dogs baseball and apple pie huh	3971	A
yeah um so what do you think's gonna happen this year to the teams	3971	A
i know	3971	A
yeah well the Giants yeah	3971	A
yeah makes you sick doesn't it	3971	A
yes	3971	A
he's like a little bitty kid huh	3971	A
yeah	3971	A
yeah well i guess the Giants or might move away from San Francisco it sounds like	3971	A
you know uh they won't be that far away but	3971	A
San Francisco it'll be hurting anyhow	3971	A
you know	3971	A
um-hum	3971	A
um-hum um-hum	3971	A
i know isn't that something you couldn't believe that huh	3971	A
yeah i just it	3971	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3971	A
um-hum	3971	A
um-hum	3971	A
yeah yeah i couldn't believe that you know i don't uh there was Braves in that chanting that they have that would drive you up a wall	3971	A
yeah well you're right	3971	A
yeah yeah yeah	3971	A
oh really	3971	A
um-hum um-hum	3971	A
yeah right	3971	A
no uh they give you a list of things that you want to talk-	3971	A
all right	3971	B
uh i like the Giants they got uh i probably didn't get into baseball until maybe	3971	B
maybe four- three years ago really	3971	B
so uh but i- i i just like the Giants i don't- i don't know why i really got into them_1 i read uh Dave Dreveki's book his autobiography and	3971	B
yeah that that was incredible	3971	B
the way he handled that entire situation yeah	3971	B
but	3971	B
i just think the Giants have a good team they they got all you know they're they're real- they're real balanced out they got real good pitching and they got the hitting to go along with it so	3971	B
yeah they just they need that i think they just need that one one element to push them_1 over the top you know i don't really know what it is but but every team that's that's really good seems you know like the A's had they had they just had it all that one year so	3971	B
yeah	3971	B
yeah	3971	B
yeah if you if you're a fan you got to stay with your team any way you know you good and the bad but	3971	B
it's it's kind of hard i still well-	3971	B
basically the the me and all my friends around here since we don't have anywhere i mean we can go to the Astros or the Rangers teams but since none- me or none of me and my friends are really really like either one of those teams so we uh	3971	B
about_1 the about the most- most baseball we get is either TV or we play it on Nintendo we play RBI baseball on Nintendo so so that's just you know that's small town trying to make it through the	3971	B
through the lull- not being around it really but	3971	B
yeah	3971	B
yeah so do i but baseball is still	3971	B
you got- you got to do something when football ain't on so	3971	B
yeah exactly this- this is America so	3971	B
uh but	3971	B
uh i don't know it's hard to say i haven't really really you have to just keep up with everything in the off season it's kind of hard to do at least you know you have to read the paper and	3971	B
Sports Illustrated and everything to keep up with who they traded and who they picked up and and all that but like i say if they can if they can get that one element that they were missing i think the Giants can do it	3971	B
they just i don't you i don't really know about the A's i don't like the A's uh matter of fact i can't stand the Oakland A's just because they have that you know they've got their	3971	B
Jose Canseco and and all the attitude that goes along with that you know the kind of	3971	B
yeah you hear what you hear did you hear what he did he ramming his car- wife's car and i- i was like yeah see that's just	3971	B
yeah he's just a a a little boy with a lot of money so that's just you know but	3971	B
yeah i've heard i've heard talk about that	3971	B
yeah they're not gonna be happy about it	3971	B
but i hope they can do good i mean that's just	3971	B
i think they're a good team that just need that one one little thing to push them_1 over i don't know	3971	B
exactly what it is they got they're pretty balanced out all the way through it just might be the drive you know more than anything else they just they probably just need something to push them_1	3971	B
because i that's that's the only thing i can see that's holding them_1 back is the ambition to do it or somebody basically maybe they just need everybody to tell them_1 they can't do it	3971	B
maybe that's what you know that's what some teams need	3971	B
look at the Twins going from worst to first so	3971	B
yeah my roommate's a my roommate's a Twins fan forever- forever so he had his year this year so	3971	B
we we got quite preoccupied- we we got into that a whole bunch that was a that was a series to remember for sure	3971	B
so i saw all seven games of that so that was definitely worth watching	3971	B
yeah	3971	B
yeah they every- every every team with the Indians been doing that now and it and it i can't figure out why i've yet to figure out why they're all doing that i'm like it doesn't work it's obvious it doesn't work because_1 the you know the Braves	3971	B
the Braves didn't win so uh why why keep on doing something that didn't work but	3971	B
i don't know i was i was kind of surprised that we're gonna talk about baseball and i get a woman's voice i was i was i was thinking uh-huh i talked to a guy named Vinny last night about fixing your car so	3971	B
yeah i got i called got a call the other night about about_1 fixing your automobile up so	3971	B
but	3971	B
well baseball baseball it's it's kind of i don't know it's kind of odd that they'd do you pick the topic or does the computer	3971	B
hello	3990	B
my name's Dan	3990	B
nice to meet you	3990	B
i think so	3990	B
uh no uh luckily i don't i just rent them	3990	B
yeah i'm a i'm an assistant scout master for a boy scout troop	3990	B
yeah it's	3990	B
it's it's it's so much better to to rent	3990	B
yeah	3990	B
ooh	3990	B
that's uh let's see i- i used to be able to do this quite well but that was when i was in college	3990	B
yeah the college that i've got that that i went to was pretty good which was Cal Poly in Pomona	3990	B
and uh you know it was a regular it was a state university and it seemed to be pretty good	3990	B
oh really which one	3990	B
um-hum	3990	B
um-hum	3990	B
yeah uh	3990	B
well my my parents wanted me to go to uh community college	3990	B
and uh i ended up getting into the university and they never really said anything about it until	3990	B
uh my sisters went to college and they they went to the community college	3990	B
and my parents- my father's going jeez it it it uh	3990	B
costs a lot more or just as much to go to community college and you aren't getting as much you know so	3990	B
um-hum	3990	B
oh yeah	3990	B
yeah	3990	B
um-hum	3990	B
uh well because_1 his parents gave him the car to go there well you know	3990	B
um-hum	3990	B
uh-huh that's that's the way colleges are right now anyway is they they have a bunch of kids come down they say hey you wanna be here	3990	B
it's it's so it's pointed towards you	3990	B
and if they sell you well enough there ain't nothing that's going to change your mind	3990	B
we're consumers in society	3990	B
um-hum	3990	B
yeah	3990	B
yeah you got to-	3990	B
got to find the good classes and things like that	3990	B
i- i well i can imagine that i- i started off the the counselor at high school said oh you wanna do this well then go into aerospace- aerospace	3990	B
i went and my first day of enrollment in college i walked around i go into the aerospace building they give me the curriculum and it's like twenty one units to twenty four units a quarter	3990	B
yeah and average is like you know it's supposed to be like sixteen eighteen you know	3990	B
you know this is like i don't want to be a doctor	3990	B
yeah yeah i happened to be walking down the hall turned into some some other instructor's office and said help me and he sold me on his program	3990	B
yeah	3990	B
yeah	3990	B
yeah	3990	B
um-hum	3990	B
yeah	3990	B
well they there there's some tests like that now but they're kind of strange some of them_1 you know it's like you you you should be a cement mixer or something like that you know	3990	B
you know and the guy walked in going yeah but i wanted to be a psychologist	3990	B
yeah	3990	B
what's what's your major	3990	B
i'm Bridget	3990	A
it's nice to meet you are you ready for me to push one	3990	A
okay	3990	A
okay do you have any kids	3990	A
you do	3990	A
oh that's good	3990	A
a little easier	3990	A
well what would you think if they were going off to college	3990	A
uh-huh	3990	A
uh-huh	3990	A
yeah because_1 i'm in college right now i thought God this is a good question	3990	A
i was like because_1 i- i know how my parents when i was looking at colleges	3990	A
they didn't really say anything i mean they didn't say you know i want you to go here or you know they left it up to me	3990	A
and uh i thought it was real interesting because_1 i picked where i wanted to go and then afterwards my mom was like oh i really kind of wish you would have gone there and i didn't even know that she'd even you know liked another place or anything	3990	A
but i don't think that parents could make that decision for you	3990	A
uh-huh	3990	A
uh-huh	3990	A
yeah definitely	3990	A
because_1 i know people-	3990	A
i know some of my friends whose parents really wanted them to go somewhere so they did and they hate it you know	3990	A
or that they don't do good and they fail out and it's like because_1 i know one person	3990	A
um his parents wanted him to go to SMU really bad	3990	A
and he went and he doesn't like it- i mean he wouldn't admit to you that he doesn't like it but it you know he's not doing good and he never is excited about it or anything and he won't tell his parents i was like well why don't you transfer you know	3990	A
yeah i mean i really the car wouldn't get it because_1 i just think that's sad i don't think parents can can make that decision for you i you know	3990	A
if you if they let i think you should choose and you know work something out between y'all God	3990	A
yeah	3990	A
yeah oh i know	3990	A
yeah see	3990	A
that's right that's right that's definitely true	3990	A
yeah sad as long as i just think as long as people are happy so many people will go some place and transfer or whatever	3990	A
it's like you got to find where you fit in best	3990	A
stuff like that	3990	A
uh-huh	3990	A
uh and you're like uh i don't think i want to do that	3990	A
yeah	3990	A
yeah you're like i- i really didn't want to do it i was just kidding you know i just thought i'd come try it out	3990	A
yeah really	3990	A
yeah you can't have- someone can't choose that for you that's why i think people people i know that stay in school so long it's because_1 they can't figure out what they wanna do	3990	A
like what- you know and they start with one major and they go through the certain you know classes you have to take for that major then they change their mind	3990	A
and it's like oh you got to start all over because_1 you lose all the classes you just took that's crazy that's like	3990	A
they need to hire someone to help you and everyone should have to take like a test or something of what you might want to do because_1 i think that's so sad because_1 people	3990	A
yeah there are	3990	A
yeah	3990	A
yeah you're going you should be a farmer you're like a farmer- what	3990	A
yeah i know we took those in like high school those are stupid	3990	A
they ought to tell you mine is psychology	3990	A
well i i think we could use a lot of it at home but definitely a hot spot is the poor last year proved	3900	B
a lot of	3900	B
i agree	3900	B
uh i i agree i like the i like the the peace process spend more money on things like that and especially with um i don't know the	3900	B
Palestinians and the Israelis fighting so much over who is going to go to this peace conference i'd tie some of the money to those peace conferences if	3900	B
they don't want to go to the peace conference then i guess they don't want the two billion dollars for the next batch of F fifteens or whatever	3900	B
but- which we'll never do but i- i think it is about time especially with the Israelis that we	3900	B
because many times in the past they've you know they're happy to take our money and stuff but they often times fail to give us any support in return	3900	B
right well uh they they seem to do a lot of that stuff the problem i have in the past at least it was you know they were very strategically- strategically important to us but i think that's diminished a lot lately too	3900	B
especially with the relationship we've started to develop with Saudi Arabia after the Gulf War and all and i don't know maybe we could use that to our advantage	3900	B
at least if we are going to be giving them all this money then at least you know we should get some at least some cooperation or whatever in return	3900	B
right	3900	B
well that's for sure	3900	B
and we built some good friends over there now with uh time when we can use them you know little rut	3900	B
right well most of the large enemies were large enemies to begin with though there's not too many people that went from being our friends to being our enemies but just	3900	B
quite a few that have been from our enemies to at least tolerating us or whatever-	3900	B
right	3900	B
that's right uh and i don't know Iran- Iran now wants them to reestablish more normal relationships with us i don't know if that is in our best interests either but	3900	B
it's good that i don't know it- it seems slightly more stable now but how long that lasts you know it can history has shown that can just be a lull before the storm	3900	B
right	3900	B
well they have the all the religious battles they have the nationalist battle they just seem to have a lot of	3900	B
different cultures and religions nationalisms all packed into that one small geographical area they all believe that they have rights to these lands you know there's	3900	B
two three four groups that all believe that this portion of land rightfully is their's	3900	B
hopefully you know optimistically maybe- maybe something you know i don't think it's all going to be rosy after this latest round of peace talks but hopefully it can be	3900	B
a start at least in the right direction	3900	B
yeah what do you think about our level of funding to Middle East Trust	3900	A
yeah i was i was thinking while i was waiting to be connected with uh	3900	A
uh another party you know i got real ambivalent uh kind of mixed feelings about it i mean i agree with you i think you know jeez there's an awful lot of money that we go over there to people that seem to be uh shall we say less than appreciative	3900	A
and at and and at the same time it- uh	3900	A
you know i think it's important for us that you know there is some sort of stability in that region	3900	A
but i don't know then again you uh historically there has such a history of uh you know just being constantly in turmoil	3900	A
that i don't know if we can throw enough dollars at them to you know keep any kind of a lasting peace over there	3900	A
so i don't it's it's i i guess bottom line if i had to uh to call the shot i would like to see the the money spent a little more uh judiciously	3900	A
oh yeah yeah	3900	A
yep yep right	3900	A
yeah well that was exactly who i i was thinking about whenever i made the comment of uh you know money going to people that seem less than appreciative	3900	A
i mean they're they're ready to take it and we set- you know have have set uh a precedence over the history with them of always having an open pocket book uh and uh you know they've just have grown to expect it	3900	A
and uh i don't mind uh helping people that i mean i don't expect somebody to grovel but at the same time don't uh you know take the money and and then uh slap me in the face	3900	A
yeah	3900	A
yeah	3900	A
right	3900	A
yeah the one good thing about the Gulf War i i mean there was several good things about it but it was one of the few things that we've ever done as a as a country that i think practically paid for itself	3900	A
and certainly there are countries over there that have the where with all to uh uh foot their fair share of the bill	3900	A
yeah	3900	A
yeah and and we built we we built some good friends and then we've also built some arch enemies so it's you know it's one tit for tat sort of	3900	A
that's true	3900	A
that's right that's right i i	3900	A
well yeah especially when if you look back at wasn't very you know that many years ago i mean back in the early seventies whenever the the Saudi's embargoed uh oil to the US we've certainly come a long way since then	3900	A
yeah right right well it's you know like i say just as uh as uh a region i don't know of any uh other part of the world that uh	3900	A
is- is so prone to change quickly and and i don't know this seems like you know they're these uh deep seeded hostilities and animosities from- that are just uh handed down generation to generation	3900	A
you're right	3900	A
yeah well i do like your idea of tying uh	3900	A
um	3905	A
i had to uh i had to return a	3905	A
that recently i've had to return uh uh a cassette recorder	3905	A
um	3905	A
my feelings about products made in the United States uh recently is that they are getting worse	3905	A
uh in fact i am kind of disappointed in American made things uh	3905	A
how about yourself	3905	A
um-hum	3905	A
um-hum	3905	A
um-hum	3905	A
have- have you recently bought a car	3905	A
what what did you buy	3905	A
they are pretty much a hundred percent American made aren't they	3905	A
or do you know is that right	3905	A
hum	3905	A
i am really surprised to hear about uh i- i haven't studied cars probably as closely as you have	3905	A
um i was really surprised that you mentioned uh Chrysler no it was GM and Ford that are um using Japanese motors and	3905	A
hum huh	3905	A
um it	3905	A
yeah let me see it was a Lloyd and um it it continually and i don't know if i think it is Japanese i think Lloyd is made in Japan and uh it it was eating my tapes	3905	A
and uh	3905	A
i don't know i am totally uh totally confounded about uh	3905	A
uh American made and Japanese and	3905	A
uh i'm not sure which is the best	3905	A
i use the Consumer Digest a lot to decide what i want to buy	3905	A
hum	3905	A
huh	3905	A
do you own a computer	3905	A
i didn't realize that i work for a CPA firm and we have a lot of computers in our office and uh the computers we use mostly are Dell computers and they are manufactured down in Texas	3905	A
uh Dell Computers- Dell Corporation	3905	A
uh uh	3905	A
uh i- i don't know ma'am uh i wouldn't be surprised if most of them_1 aren't Japanese parts but uh we've had the Dell computers for four years now and we we're really happy with them	3905	A
and we use them every day we use them_1 probably eight hours a day on the average every day so they get a lot of use	3905	A
yep	3905	A
i i'm full timing uh with the accountant's office	3905	A
what product did you have returned	3905	B
well i'm kind of confused about American made products because Ford and Chevy have Isuzu Mazda engines	3905	B
and they're considered American products	3905	B
so i don't understand if we are supposed to not buy Volvos and Volkswagons and Mazdas because they are foreign	3905	B
or if we are supposed to buy American because they're foreign but they are American cars you know what i am saying	3905	B
and i just don't understand that	3905	B
and it seems that whenever you do have a product	3905	B
parts of it are both American and overseas that it creates a problem	3905	B
both in uh the product	3905	B
and in the	3905	B
overall warranty or lasting	3905	B
yes i did	3905	B
i bought a Chrysler New Yorker and my daughter bought a Plymouth Sundance	3905	B
no uh i was surprised yes Chrysler has some of their parts built overseas also	3905	B
and i thought that was totally American	3905	B
and uh that's why i stayed away from General Motors and find out that the same thing happened to me anyway	3905	B
and engines that's true	3905	B
it seems like they're quote unquote American made where was your VCR	3905	B
what was it and what went wrong with it	3905	B
yeah i do too i don't read it but sometimes i did you know that Fitzhugh	3905	B
is a Japanese computer company and they deliberately make boards and parts wrong so you will have to buy them	3905	B
and it cannot be repaired and that upset me when i found that out	3905	B
no i don't but my daughter does and she worked with a computer company that uh serviced them	3905	B
and she is the one that told me about that because uh we were we are thinking about buying a computer we haven't done it yet	3905	B
and uh since she works for this computer- computer company i asked her what she thought was best cause if TI was using Macs and IBM clones and this type of thing	3905	B
and uh	3905	B
she was saying that she didn't know which one was the best because of the way they're put together and then she was telling me about this uh	3905	B
uh computer-	3905	B
boards just put in X number of uh	3905	B
computers and then they last for eighteen months to no longer than two years and then instead of repairing them you have to buy a whole new board	3905	B
by whom	3905	B
Dell Corporation where do they get their parts from Fitzhugh	3905	B
are you	3905	B
well maybe you're	3905	B
well you're probably fortunate you've probably got one of the better ones	3905	B
so you work part time with an accountant also	3905	B
oh	3905	B
hi uh	3977	A
i'm Bridgette i'm in Lubbock	3977	A

you haven't well i'm in college and i took it as a class like last semester and i just loved it i thought it was great it's really a lot of fun	3977	A
it's not real hard now i'm taking like weight training and i hate it it's so dumb	3977	A
really it seems so pointless	3977	A
do you	3977	A
oh my gosh	3977	A
uh-huh	3977	A
yeah i know i'm not real into like aerobics are anything like that	3977	A

you know i'm kind of i'm really bad about it	3977	A
yeah when the weather's nicer is it really	3977	A
yeah little cold for you	3977	A
i know that's how i am too because_1 i i love going outside and stuff when it's warmer and stuff but otherwise i won't i mean i won't go work out or i won't jog i won't go outside i'll just stay at home you know on the couch watching TV or renting movies or something	3977	A
yeah	3977	A
do you	3977	A
it it's	3977	A

oh listen to you uh-huh they'll catch up with you	3977	A
really	3977	A
exercise	3977	A
yeah it sort of that does make you feel better though i had to admit that you know after-	3977	A
yeah	3977	A
yeah so then when you're home you're like okay i just want to relax and not think about work and definitely not exercise you want to eat	3977	A
yeah you're probably drained and probably exercising probably wouldn't help	3977	A
uh-huh	3977	A
that have to do it	3977	A
see i've heard that	3977	A
uh-huh	3977	A
oh my gosh	3977	A
yeah	3977	A
oh my gosh	3977	A
uh-huh	3977	A
hm	3977	A
really	3977	A

yeah that's good though but i just God-	3977	A
-hello	3977	B

uh-huh	3977	B
i've tried weight training i just i just can't get into it no it	3977	B
and it well i don't like having the sore muscles i like to run- jog	3977	B
yeah i- i used to jog about six miles a day and then i- i tore the ligaments in my ankle so i- i don't really run that much but i- i- i jog some about a mile or so now	3977	B
when i have time	3977	B
yeah that's that's basically me	3977	B
i'm i'm i exercise more in in the summer and spring than i do um like this time of year because_1	3977	B
yeah that's that's basically what i do i like i like to um	3977	B
to walk too i- i guess they said it's a good form of exercise i guess uh if you consider that exercise i walk a lot	3977	B
right i because_1 i mean i i've always walked fast so i- i don't know i need to get on a some kind of exercise program though because i'm i'm starting	3977	B
to gain weight i'm getting at that age where you don't need- to start putting on the pounds	3977	B
yeah it it has caught up with me in the past year or so i've i've put on about	3977	B
twelve pounds so i need to work and get it off i thought about doing a diet but i really don't need to diet i- i just need to	3977	B
exercise i think	3977	B
yeah because_1 when i get off work i usually come home and fix dinner and watch TV and then i'm tired i take a nap whatever	3977	B
oh i work- i work eight to five so i mean	3977	B
right i- i do accounting and and it's on a computer all day and i'm so brain dead when i get off work it's kind of like just don't even talk to me just let me sit here and vegetate so	3977	B
well i don't i don't know i they say once you once you get in a routine of exercising it gives you a lot more energy- energy i know when i ran	3977	B
um i kind of got like addicted to it	3977	B
you know you see these people um i never was die hard you know they they had a story on the news about uh people becoming addicted it's like uh people that do drugs it's it's a high for them_1	3977	B
i've got a couple- uh uh a real good friend of mine that i went to school with lives here too she works for The News and Observer and she's the one who got me started running in in college and i- i was never	3977	B
die hard like she was it was we had a sleet storm and she was outside running in it icicles hanging down and all this other kind of stuff and i- i told her she was crazy but she runs about thirteen miles now	3977	B
she's really training and i when we were in college we both chain smoked like freight trains and she would get out and run everyday and it never would bother her and it's like it don't bother me	3977	B
and her husband made her stop- after she got married her husband made her stop so so now she's just like	3977	B
channeling all of her energy into running now	3977	B
now	3912	A
do you have any pets	3912	A
oh you do	3912	A
oh my goodness are they uh a specialty kind of um cats or	3912	A
um-hum	3912	A
oh my	3912	A
um-hum	3912	A
well we have uh a cat and a dog and a turtle	3912	A
a turtle we have a turtle uh the the turtle kind of was inherited from the school where i teach the uh children found it last year going out through the uh property	3912	A
it's just a small one it's not one of those large ones at all it's one- a very very small turtle	3912	A
and they had it in their classroom all year long almost and were going to let it go	3912	A
and i didn't have the heart it it wasn't even my classroom it was the next door classroom i didn't have the heart to watch them let it go so i said i would keep it during the summer time so uh we are	3912	A
oh gee	3912	A
oh	3912	A
oh	3912	A
uh-huh oh my goodness well you know and it's- it's- it's very hard for me to have any living uh creatures	3912	A
and and then uh sort of watch them disappear it was no trouble to have this turtle it has uh tank and then they don't do anything and it's not large	3912	A
and uh our cat uh is a another little story we've had the cat for several years now but um uh uh when my my children uh	3912	A
started school at Cistercian school up in Irving you might be familiar with it since you're from the general location it's a boys school well anyway uh one of the persons in the car pool	3912	A
uh their cats were always having kittens and uh my husband was driving the car pool one day he was off from work and he said he'd accept one of the cats now i had been avoiding this for years	3912	A
but he said that when the cats were weaned that we would take one of the cats	3912	A
now i don't really mind i don't really mind but i know that once you take a little living creature there that there's another responsibility in in the house and uh	3912	A
so we have uh a uh what do we have Siamese all the Siamese traits came out in this one particular cat it's not a thoroughbred Siamese	3912	A
but it looks if you were to see it you'd say oh you have a Siamese cat but i know it's not a thoroughbred but it it and we have had her for many	3912	A
oh gosh i think we've had her almost eight years now	3912	A
seven years or something	3912	A
oh my	3912	A
oh my	3912	A
um-hum	3912	A
right	3912	A
um-hum	3912	A
oh i see	3912	A
um-hum um-hum well our our cat is um	3912	A
is not the most lap cat although she will uh when she's uh in the right mood uh you know let you hold her on her lap uh and you know she's not uh	3912	A
uh a a bad cat but uh she she kind of is her own cat in in her own way although as i said she will uh she will come around you and she will let you hold her but she's not really a lap cat hum-um	3912	A
yeah	3912	A
oh we have a um a black uh Lab	3912	A
and actually it's a cross between a golden and a black so it has longer hair	3912	A
and we've we've had her now for um	3912	A
oh about almost	3912	A
ten or eleven years now	3912	A
oh yeah	3912	A
uh yes we currently have three we have two cats and a dog	3912	B
well we have quite- a big household here	3912	B
well they're um	3912	B
uh	3912	B
the we have a solid black one that's kind of long hair and uh but he's i don't know he's has a little Persian in him but we're not not sure how much and	3912	B
that we inherited the neighbors uh	3912	B
Persian and when they had to move to a place that wouldn't allow cats so uh he was like a full full blooded Persian um	3912	B
and then our dog's a big old golden retriever	3912	B
how about you you have some	3912	B
and a turtle hm	3912	B
uh-huh	3912	B
oh was it	3912	B
well we we were in uh similar- we kind of did a did a similar thing uh we inherited a lizard from my uh my son's uh uh class	3912	B
yeah	3912	B
yeah yeah	3912	B
okay-	3912	B
oh had you	3912	B
uh-huh	3912	B
yes yes there is and uh	3912	B
uh-huh	3912	B
it looks Siamese yeah	3912	B
yeah	3912	B
well we just had a uh uh oh it happened about a year ago we had a cat that we had	3912	B
for uh twenty years uh the- the year we got married we we got the cat and she finally uh died right after uh Christmas a a year ago	3912	B
and that was kind of uh	3912	B
uh a sad parting but she had a little bit of Siamese	3912	B
uh if you looked at her face you'd you'd picture Siamese although she was solid black too but	3912	B
um uh my wife uh uh uh kind of missed her because she was uh a cat you could hold in your lap and stuff the two cats we have now don't care at all to be	3912	B
held or anything like that	3912	B
uh-huh	3912	B
yeah yeah	3912	B
on- on her own terms	3912	B
and what kind of- what kind of dog do you have	3912	B
oh okay yeah they're friendly too	3912	B
oh okay	3912	B
is- is she a real- a real friendly type of dog	3912	B
well so you you don't know too much about the Dallas Mavericks this this-	3947	B
no they are uh only just a slightly a bit better than uh the other expansion teams they're they're they're a team in disarray right now	3947	B
actually i used to and i gave it up this year because i thought well Roy Tarpley wasn't going to make it and sure enough about a week after i decided not to buy my ticket he went down with his uh his drug problems	3947	B
and uh boy the team just is going into a tailspin since then	3947	B
yeah	3947	B
you're kidding	3947	B
how'd you manage that	3947	B
um-hum	3947	B
sound sounds like a real game huh	3947	B
well he must he must be a pretty big guy	3947	B
gee	3947	B
well it's it's it's nice to see those- those- you know those kind of guys when they get paid all those big bucks to uh you know to be halfway friendly	3947	B
but i know what you mean about talking about_1 being big i mean that's when i was in high school	3947	B
i got- i went to a Cleveland Cavaliers game i'm from Ohio	3947	B
and a friend of mine runs or used to run the clock down on the floor so he'd let me get down on the floor at half time and i stood by these guys they all walked out and and gee whiz they're just monsters	3947	B
seven foot doesn't sound that tall but boy when you stand next to one it it is real tall	3947	B
so if you you don't- you don't get down to uh basketball games very often then	3947	B
um-hum	3947	B
wow	3947	B
so you didn't watch the all star game uh yesterday	3947	B
yeah i- i got out the weather was so nice here that i got out and didn't didn't see any of it	3947	B
well that's uh you you talking about the Olympics now	3947	B
yeah the summer Olympics is his next thing	3947	B
well i really you know it's it's his choice to play but there's a lot of other people you know the other team's choice not not to play against him i think he's gonna find a lot of people just say well heck i'm not going to worry- you know i'm not gonna mess with that	3947	B
are you serious	3947	B
how can- how can they do that if he doesn't played the whole season	3947	B
oh unless they yeah unless they're just carrying a one odd guy instead of carrying the ten or eleven that they carry just carry one less	3947	B
well i you know i didn't watch the game but a a friend of mine was telling me that he you know he played a lot but he he played then he'd sit down then he'd play and he'd sit down and it wasn't like he was out there for twenty or thirty minutes at a at a go	3947	B
yeah once once uh he starts losing that weight and can't keep it on you know he'll have to slow down and not not do that kind of stuff that that's got to be awful tough- awful tough on his body-	3947	B
oh gee -whiz the the they are	3947	B
they need players and and they need a front office that that can judge players we've traded away so many good players in the past five years and got nothing for them_1	3947	B
and drafted so many bad players and you know they haven't turned out	3947	B
it's uh it's very frustrating we had- we had one year where we had two first round picks	3947	B
and we picked uh a guy by the name of Bill Wittington uh who's a seven foot center a white guy and Uvay Blob another seven foot white center	3947	B
and they are both okay but i think both of them_1 are playing in the Italy now	3947	B
and they you know they they traded away Mark Aguirre and got nothing for him	3947	B
i mean he had to go but they- they	3947	B
no what where they at this year uh they win in their division	3947	A
uh-huh	3947	A
uh-huh do you do you have a season pass you go watch them_1 or	3947	A
uh-huh	3947	A
huh	3947	A
yeah that's too bad i'm i guess i'd be most familiar with uh the Jazz	3947	A
uh and i've never watched them_1 but uh interestingly enough i i i got to meet Carl Malone	3947	A
huh-uh uh well it i live about forty five miles from Jackpot Nevada	3947	A
and uh it's a town- it's a town where they uh have uh uh casinos and so forth	3947	A
and i guess that's one of his pastimes i caught him down there and he was playing the slot machines and uh yeah you know would you know it somebody like him	3947	A
he hit a five thousand dollar jackpot and then he turned around hit- hit another two thousand dollar jackpot	3947	A
and they came and took his picture and you know got the uh the IRS forms and stuff and he sat there and put all the money back into the machine lost every penny of it didn't bother him a bit	3947	A
just yeah just doing it for enjoyment	3947	A
it was incredible when he stood up he just towered he was a good foot above anybody in there	3947	A
and uh everybody- everybody was uh kind of excited to see him and he's he oddly enough he was uh very friendly and cordial and stopped to sign a few things and	3947	A
so it was it was neat	3947	A
yeah	3947	A
um-hum	3947	A
um-hum	3947	A
uh-huh	3947	A
yep yeah i hear you so	3947	A
i don't no we've got a small of course this isn't professional basketball but uh the CSI Golden Eagles	3947	A
i don't know if you've heard of them they're they're number they're the number one junior college in the state in the nation excuse me	3947	A
and uh so they're here and they're kind of fun to go watch but uh uh that's- that's the the most closest i get to in fact i've only seen one professional basketball game uh	3947	A
i kind of watched it on television parts of it i didn't i didn't see the whole thing	3947	A
uh-huh	3947	A
uh yeah well- well what do you think about Magic Johnson should he play or should he	3947	A
yeah i guess the summer Olympics is uh what they	3947	A
yeah	3947	A
uh-huh yeah well- i don't- i think they that they'd feel that way too interestingly enough they've kept a seat- a seat open	3947	A
uh and he may even play in the in the tournament games for uh LA	3947	A
i'm serious i heard that the other day on a sports	3947	A
i i don't know i don't know i guess the roster's one man you know there's a hole there still	3947	A
yeah	3947	A
right	3947	A
that's what they've done	3947	A
and there's	3947	A
yeah	3947	A
no he wasn't and the the the part i saw is he he made the last shot of the game off balance three pointer and	3947	A
i guess so	3947	A
uh-huh	3947	A
yeah	3947	A
uh-huh	3947	A
well when's your Mavericks gonna do something	3947	A
they need more people they need a coach what do they need	3947	A
players	3947	A
hm	3947	A
hm	3947	A
um-hum	3947	A
well that's uh debatable if if you read the paper every day looks like there's a new scandal breaking ever ever minute uh	3943	B
yeah it is that guy that does the traveling show that's that's on Broadway and everything now	3943	B
yeah that's supposed to be great i don't know as long as there lawyers making up the majority of the state legislatures and the national Congress uh	3943	B
i don't see a lot of change happening	3943	B
isn't that funny how that just happens to be a correlation	3943	B
i'm afraid not unfortunately	3943	B
right i saw a	3943	B
a lawyer joke book the other day and it and the title of the joke was skid marks and of course there's a major joke about skid marks and lawyers	3943	B
but uh i don't know it just it's pretty disgusting every time you	3943	B
it it's not just the unethical part of it it's the self-serving part of it	3943	B
that bothers me about the politicians they're all out	3943	B
either for a particular controlled interest group of some kind or maybe several uh and rather than really honestly decide issues on the basis of what is good for the country	3943	B
everybody decides them with this the constituency in mind or or afraid that they're gonna hack off the wrong group or the other vote wise	3943	B
and yeah exactly and so we if we just limited terms senators especially	3943	B
and even Supreme Court judges this appointing them_1 for life is just absurd they wind up senile old men making decisions at eighty years old	3943	B
just just say that the most you can serve is a couple of terms and then get in there and then you could get in there and do the best possible job that you really feel like you should be doing and then you're out of there and go on to something else instead of this	3943	B
because_1 this exactly well at least you'd decide things you'd decide things from the stand point of what's best hopefully for whatever agency you're representing	3943	B
yeah i know	3943	B
i just- i just think we ought to we limit the President why not terms of the others and give there's plenty of other qualified people to run	3943	B
um-hum	3943	B
exactly	3943	B
hm	3943	B
that's right and above nothing either starting with Duvall County	3943	B
yep	3943	B
yeah that's that's probably true	3943	B
i haven't	3943	B
yeah i don't	3943	B
well that's it when the very people making the laws are gonna be the ones who would have to pass those uh against themselves it it sort of uh	3943	B
goes without saying that it'd be awfully awfully tough unless you could get the best thing that could happen uh to the state legislatures would be to be full of just	3943	B
independent- independent- independent businessmen or just businessmen working for companies that could somehow get their salary made	3943	B
uh justified you know or brought up to whatever over the state salary level uh	3943	B
Mike the subject is almost laughable is there such a thing as an honest politician	3943	A
oh i agree with you	3943	A
it's amazing Will Rogers who was in the twenties and thirties if you hear the guy that gimmicks him and uses his same material it is pertinent today as it was then	3943	A
uh	3943	A
yeah	3943	A
um-hum	3943	A
attorneys yeah did you catch that the defensive driving course you can take to get out of a ticket was recently changed from two years to once every twelve months	3943	A
it was also noted in some journal that the percentage of ownership of the driving schools by legislatures has greatly increased	3943	A
yes yes they're not down there to to live off the salary of uh what they're paid	3943	A
and course you know the the famous joke is Japan does so good in business because they only let ten attorneys a year graduate each year and that's if fifteen had died the year before and	3943	A
yes yes	3943	A
uh	3943	A
um-hum um-hum	3943	A
um-hum	3943	A
and won't get reelected	3943	A
i agree with you a hundred percent	3943	A
oh i think all the way-	3943	A
uh	3943	A
all the way down to dog catchers of the city yes sir limited turn	3943	A
two two	3943	A
um-hum um-hum	3943	A
you go to you know get elected to another office and let somebody else pay you	3943	A
uh you seen the benefits that	3943	A
yeah	3943	A
the benefits legislatures uh state and senate and uh	3943	A
and legislatures in Washington get after they've been there a few terms is unbelievable they get their salary for life health benefits for life	3943	A
oh uh uh have- have you ever noticed when	3943	A
what	3943	A
right	3943	A
they tried that in in Washington or was it or Oregon	3943	A
but speaker of the house was from there	3943	A
and if approved it he would not have been eligible to continue representing and being speaker	3943	A
and so the voters- voters kicked it said no we we since we're the one with the with the gun right now we're not gonna vote out having the gun control- having the power	3943	A
so when i- i don't LBJ's a perfect example of how somebody can be broke and get into politics and come out rich as yeah	3943	A
well they- they used to say in advertising that the textbook example of good competitive advertising- advertising is Hertz and Avis rent a car commercials number one number two i guess LBJ has to be a textbook example of politician without any morals	3943	A
i don't think one of the question- question was could they legislate laws to keep politicians honest my opinion no because_1 they won't pass laws against themselves	3943	A
um-hum	3943	A
let them_1	3943	A
um-hum	3943	A
where you calling from	3991	A
okay all right so am i	3991	A
okay you understand the topic	3991	A
okay i'm going to go hit the button	3991	A
so what do you think about the death penalty	3991	A
um-hum	3991	A
um-hum	3991	A
um-hum	3991	A
um-hum	3991	A
oh	3991	A
hum	3991	A
for psychopathic killers and stuff	3991	A
yeah	3991	A
um-hum well what'd you think about Jeffrey Dahmer now	3991	A
well	3991	A
well he got fifteen life sentences	3991	A
for uh	3991	A
sane	3991	A
right um-hum	3991	A
well okay so i see- he can get up to fifteen life sentences	3991	A
and uh i he with no chance for parole	3991	A
but uh	3991	A
hum	3991	A
uh-huh	3991	A
well huh that's not very good	3991	A
uh-huh	3991	A
uh-huh	3991	A
uh-huh hum	3991	A
now what's uh what is a life term if someone gets a life term what's the earliest they can get out	3991	A
uh-huh	3991	A
wow	3991	A
um-hum well now i know in uh	3991	A
in Virginia i- i think it's about the same i want to say each life term you're eligible for parole within fifteen years	3991	A
and uh i knew um	3991	A
uh-huh	3991	A
uh-huh	3991	A
oh	3991	A
oh okay yeah see they should make consecutively i don't like this concurrent stuff	3991	A
right right	3991	A
um-hum	3991	A
right	3991	A
hum	3991	A
yeah	3991	A
um-hum	3991	A
see that's what what i don't like is warehousing you know i mean if you make them useful you know put them_1 in jail and make them do something you know	3991	A
uh i don't know make license plates you know	3991	A
i mean it to me uh for me to pay i mean what does it cost uh per year to uh to keep uh an inmate i think they said it's something like eighteen thousand dollars per- per person is is what we were paying per inmate that's a lot of money	3991	A
you know i mean some people don't even make that much money a year you know	3991	A
and i think that's free	3991	A
uh-huh	3991	A
uh-huh	3991	A
um-hum	3991	A
yeah yeah	3991	A
yeah	3991	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3991	A
well-	3991	A
hi i'm Susan Linnstaedter	3991	B
uh i'm in Dallas	3991	B
uh yeah um-hum	3991	B
uh well	3991	B
i've mixed feelings i guess you'd say	3991	B
it's it's not something that uh i mean uh you know it doesn't make me happy	3991	B
but uh	3991	B
on the other hand you know the present alternatives at least in Texas are not real good i mean it's an all or nothing proposition you know you either you either uh give somebody a death penalty or	3991	B
they're out on the streets in a very short time to uh have- have a repeat performance of whatever they did um	3991	B
and i guess uh you know i guess i should mention i'm an attorney and i used to do some criminal work and um	3991	B
as long as it's reserved for	3991	B
special purposes and as long as as uh you know the judicial process that's afforded to someone pretty much	3991	B
you know makes you feel good about that you've got the right guy then i guess i- i can live with it	3991	B
uh i haven't been keeping up with that i've been in and out of of town and i haven't kept up with it what's happening to him	3991	B
um-hum uh so they went ahead and ruled him uh at least legally sane to stand trial	3991	B
okay	3991	B
see we don't have that in Texas that's the problem	3991	B
is is you can't give somebody life without parole at least at this point	3991	B
no i mean you know uh a life sentence	3991	B
they get time and a half for um time served and uh if they get made a trustee they get good time um which is like two two days for every day they serve	3991	B
and they can really be out or eligible for parole in a fairly short space of time	3991	B
i want to say	3991	B
uh you know they've changed things since i used to since i used to practice that kind of work but i think that	3991	B
somebody told me that within ten or twelve years they would be um eligible for parole	3991	B
i mean it's not very long	3991	B
um-hum	3991	B
well see also in Texas it's real unusual for them to do what they call stack them stack the penalties	3991	B
they they will they will cause the penalties to run concurrently	3991	B
yeah i mean on on something like a like a Jeffrey Dahlmer or somebody like that you know that definitely i mean you know why go through the farce of having a parole hearing	3991	B
you know what's going to happen if you let him out i mean we and in Texas too i mean i smaller states like Vermont uh and places like that have some real innovative	3991	B
rehabilitation type activities that they can do in their penal system and in a in a state like Texas we don't have that	3991	B
they get down there we are warehousing people basically	3991	B
and they go down there and they maybe pick up a few tricks you know how to be worse and uh and then you turn them loose on society and i just don't think that that's i don't think that's right i don't think that's fair	3991	B
yeah	3991	B
something yeah	3991	B
uh it's a lot	3991	B
yeah	3991	B
huh-uh	3991	B
well and and if you consider the fact that with with all the the federal lawsuits that went on and all the standards that there are for how you can and cannot treat prisoners and and what they're entitled to have	3991	B
frankly you know it's it's considered cruel and inhumane for a prisoner at the state penitentiary	3991	B
to live in conditions that would look pretty attractive to some of the homeless people who have not committed a crime	3991	B
you know i mean we just our system is is is kind of skewed somehow or another	3991	B
and like i say i mean you know i can't- i can't tell you i feel good about the fact that we put people to death	3991	B
i mean i really uh you know deep down i guess that bothers-	3991	B
uh just the one screamer	3989	B
he's eighteen months today	3989	B
yeah	3989	B
and uh	3989	B
huh yeah and he's um he's discovered pens and that you lick the backs of stamps	3989	B
that's what he was screaming about i just uh	3989	B
yes i i'm a full time mother and i spend all day	3989	B
yes and i spend all day with the baby	3989	B
i see a real growing trend for families going back into the home	3989	B
where a lot- a lot more people if they really can can make a a tight budget they're going back to where the women take care of the children at home	3989	B
and not working and not	3989	B
yeah i think uh	3989	B
i personally see that happening maybe i'm not in the right neighborhood but	3989	B
i really do see it a big trend toward that and	3989	B
people even not waiting as late in life as they had been	3989	B
i know for a while that there were people waiting to have their families and i think that trend is is slowing down	3989	B
um-hum	3989	B
yeah	3989	B
um-hum	3989	B
oh yeah	3989	B
uh-huh	3989	B
ah uh-huh	3989	B
yeah	3989	B
well i agree it	3989	B
it's really important to me to support my family	3989	B
to support my children and to support the children of my brother and sister too	3989	B
that i think children without support are really they're missing out a lot	3989	B
uh-huh	3989	B
uh-huh	3989	B
yeah	3989	B
oh and it	3989	B
well it obviously made a really good impression on you	3989	B
so	3989	B
yeah well i agree i'm i'm even considering putting my son at at two in a tumbling class	3989	B
and you know going and maybe staying with him during most of the class and then going to see what he does and all that	3989	B
because i really i think it's important for children to be around children but i also think it's important for there to be a tight nucleus at home	3989	B
so i'm	3989	B
trying to think of what else what was the other part of the topic	3989	B
trends	3989	B
yeah	3989	B
yes	3989	B
well	3989	B
oh are you	3989	B
well he	3989	B
he has a tendency um	3989	B
to leave it to me since i'm with him all day	3989	B
and it's really hard for me to let go too	3989	B
i feel very attached to my son and i i'm sure it would change if i had another one	3989	B
but um	3989	B
i just don't think that	3989	B
i don't know i- i don't see much of a change happening there i wish they would spend more time together	3989	B
but	3989	B
we'll uh we'll see how that goes	3989	B
he's um a scientist with TI	3989	B
well it's um it's not the speech study but it's a different kind of study i mean he he works	3989	B
in uh laser he's a laser physicist	3989	B
so it's a completely different line of work	3989	B
than uh than the speech program but	3989	B
anyhow	3989	B
um-hum	3989	B
children do you have	3989	A
okay how old how old i- is uh he or she	3989	A
all right	3989	A
year and a half	3989	A
uh-huh	3989	A
um-hum	3989	A
well i would suppose a lot of your time is spent with yours then	3989	A
uh-huh	3989	A
uh-huh	3989	A
uh-huh How how do you see most of the world now uh uh the country spending time with their children	3989	A
and not working so much to	3989	A
live live in the fancy homes and drive the nice cars	3989	A
uh	3989	A
uh-huh	3989	A
uh-huh	3989	A
hm	3989	A
i i'd have to agree with you that's what's happening back here in the west more people are	3989	A
are just saying it's not worth it and uh	3989	A
and spending more time at at home	3989	A
i know it's tough for our family to do that i've got three kids	3989	A
and uh my oldest one is only six but she's still in dance and kindergarten and you know she's got a bunch of things going on and	3989	A
and uh i my it's a good thing my wife she she does work a little bit she works part time	3989	A
as a college instructor she at a junior college here but she has time to go to all of her uh dance concert recitals and things and and it just means so much and i i try to be there but i don't get to go all the time	3989	A
uh-huh	3989	A
uh-huh	3989	A
yeah my you know when when i was growing up my i i played high school sports	3989	A
and my dad rarely missed a football game- my mom- mom and dad both but mostly my dad rarely missed a football game or a basketball game even if we had to travel away from the local area	3989	A
he would always go and uh i remember that and i'll never forget that you know	3989	A
uh-huh	3989	A
and that's something that i'd sure like to do with my kids when they	3989	A
uh-huh	3989	A
uh-huh	3989	A
um trends and uh	3989	A
we've talked about trends um you're you're talking about your family- does your do you find your husband has a hard time spending time with the child	3989	A
it's tough isn't it i sure have a hard time see i still at work now	3989	A
yes it's uh it is sure tough for me	3989	A
uh-huh	3989	A
yep	3989	A
yeah what what line of business is he in	3989	A
hum	3989	A
So he's part of the study here then almost isn't he	3989	A
uh-huh	3989	A
uh-huh	3989	A
uh-huh	3989	A
yep	3989	A
well i i'm an accountant and i know it takes it's it takes a lot of lot of time away from the home	3989	A
and so uh i just don't i the only time i get a lot of time with my kids is when	3989	A
well Barbara whenever you get around to purchasing your next new car	3999	A
what are going to be the chief considerations	3999	A
uh i'm interested primarily in reliability	3999	A
uh	3999	A
well	3999	A
well uh let me give you a little history on that i drove- i drove uh GM cars for a long time	3999	A
and in fact i had a a Chevrolet and it ended up costing- it was only about five or six years old and i was paying on the average a hundred dollars a month in repair bills on that thing	3999	A
and i just couldn't handle that so i took a deep breath and bought a Toyota	3999	A
and have lived happily ever after since then yes yes i've had two small problems neither one of which left me by the side of the road	3999	A
uh with the Toyota in the last five years and and when i was buying that i was concerned primarily with reliability- reliability	3999	A
and but i also wanted a hatchback	3999	A
because you know you- you sometimes you have to carry bags of fertilizer	3999	A
uh	3999	A
so	3999	A
well it is a sports car that i got which is my first probably my last one because	3999	A
comfort is not	3999	A
high on the list when you get a sports car	3999	A
no	3999	A
just me	3999	A
just me	3999	A
does your car have an air bag	3999	A
it does	3999	A
yeah	3999	A
yeah i suspect they probably will	3999	A
and i think on my next car i'll be concerned i'll i think i will want antilock brakes	3999	A
i've heard good things about them_1 it was the first year it was offered on the Toyota Supra when i bought mine	3999	A
and i was a little nervous about some new technology i mean i'd got to where i had real- this real hate relationship with anything that looked like service department at a dealership	3999	A
um-hum	3999	A
yeah	3999	A
yeah i think i'd i'd like that i don't know i- i have a friend who drives an Acura Legend which is very comfortable car	3999	A
and it it makes me more aware of how uncomfortable mine is every time i ride in his car	3999	A
uh-huh	3999	A
oh is it	3999	A
uh-huh	3999	A
yeah	3999	A
yes	3999	A
uh-huh	3999	A
well that's great	3999	A
that's great	3999	A
so if you had to do it again you'd buy another Chrysler do you think would you	3999	A
that's	3999	A
yeah that's interesting because i mean i- i was hearing a just on on the way home from work the other day i heard something on the news about the trade deficit for December the figures were some some very large number	3999	A
i was thinking golly and and you know it's partly my fault i mean not in December but	3999	A
i- i really have a problem buying Japanese things and for years i bought American	3999	A
and i don't know i hope by the time this car wears out and i hope that's not for another five or ten years	3999	A
i hope that i can get an American one at that time	3999	A
oh sure it	3999	A
yeah	3999	A
one of the main considerations is safety and quietness and um economy what about you	3999	B
well i have found most of the cars now are pretty reliable um	3999	B
i haven't found any that have left me down yet what are your specific requirements American or foreign	3999	B
really	3999	B
um-hum	3999	B
do you have a family for comfort or	3999	B
just you	3999	B
well i had the same problem whenever i had a General Motors car i had a Chevy and uh	3999	B
it was constantly giving me valve problems i had this constant ticking of the valves and uh i switched over to Chrysler	3999	B
Plymouth	3999	B
and i haven't had a lick of problem	3999	B
yes	3999	B
but just on the driver's side	3999	B
i wish they would come out with them everywhere- on the passenger side too	3999	B
uh-huh	3999	B
well i found out they're pretty good whenever uh especially on weather like we're having today and and uh the roads are so slippery	3999	B
the antilock brakes are one of the better ones to have	3999	B
um-hum	3999	B
my daughter has a	3999	B
Civic Honda and that's a real comfortable car to sit in yeah which surprised me	3999	B
i have a Chrysler now i just bought and uh it's real comfortable	3999	B
and i'm very happy with it but Chrysler has a good warranty that they have to stand behind so i haven't had any	3999	B
worries about that that's one thing i go for in a car is their warranty and uh	3999	B
what does and doesn't come under that warrantee but they have the seven thousand- uh seven thousand- seventy thousand miles or seven years i believe	3999	B
and uh bumper to bumper and i have no complaints	3999	B
so far with mine	3999	B
i sure would	3999	B
Dodge Plymouth Chrysler something in that line	3999	B
um-hum	3999	B
well	3999	B
well that's another fallacy because uh so many people say that's a requirement has to be American	3999	B
but uh did you know that my Chrysler has foreign parts in it and so does Chevy and so does Ford	3999	B
so um i often hear people saying well i want to buy American or i like the foreign something and uh	3999	B
they're built right here like the foreign cars are even built over here Datsun has a	3999	B
good	3929	B
well my uh uh my interests lie mainly in classical music	3929	B
and uh uh uh although i wasn't raised with opera it's it's something that i've i come to enjoy how about_1 yourself	3929	B
right absolutely	3929	B
sure	3929	B
sound	3929	B
well i uh i tend to shy away from anyone who uh uh is born later than nineteen hundred	3929	B
uh other than Aaron Copeland uh Aaron Copeland i enjoy	3929	B
oh Gershwin- uh Gershwin's uh i i i uh	3929	B
i i haven't uh quite found jazz to be enjoyable and and and a lot of Gershwin has a a some of some of his work is a little uh has- has- has a touch- enough- enough of jazz uh	3929	B
that uh that uh is not particularly enjoyable for me to listen to the uh	3929	B
uh	3929	B
uh like i i i suspect my favorites uh are in the uh seventeenth and eighteenth century uh uh musicians uh i'd	3929	B
the uh oh there's one uh uh i guess more recent one with uh Copeland uh is uh Raspegie who uh i was always amazed that he was uh so contemporary- uh contemporary	3929	B
um but i uh	3929	B
uh i our family gets down to uh the Myerson relatively frequently it it's our uh uh our one enjoyable uh if if we can make it to Saturday uh everything's okay	3929	B
so it's uh it's a relatively busy uh activity we uh one uh very nice uh uh opportunity that we've had is the is the Dallas Chamber Orchestra	3929	B
that has uh uh uh actually it's it's it's wonderful they they have a Sunday matinee that uh uh if you buy two season tickets the kids go free	3929	B
and uh that gives us an opportunity to uh	3929	B
uh to take to to uh uh make sure the kids uh get uh get dressed up and and go to the symphony whether they want to or not and	3929	B
and uh and they uh their they oblige us by falling asleep so least that's pretty good	3929	B
they're uh eleven nine and eight which is and it's it's nice in that uh	3929	B
in that uh their- their- you- their they you can get real close to the uh to the chamber orchestra and see the music and watch the musicians it's uh it's a very intimate setting and the the music's really very good	3929	B
right	3929	B
it was just a recital	3929	B
oh um-hum	3929	B
right	3929	B
right	3929	B
-go now what kinds of things do you like to listen to	3929	A
is that right uh-huh	3929	A
well actually i kind of like those same things myself and um uh i did uh study some music in school although i'm not um	3929	A
a musician i just took it kind of as an avocation and i sing with the Brookhaven singers over at Brookhaven College you must be familiar with that name living in Dallas	3929	A
and uh they have um a lovely woman over there who um teaches singing and um	3929	A
has a Saturday class as well as private lessons and uh we go and we sing for some retirement homes and at the Botanical Gardens and things like that and uh	3929	A
really very very very enjoyable and i do try to get down to the symphony at least a couple of times a year and i didn't get down to the opera this year though but i have in the past um	3929	A
but anyway i do enjoy listening to especially the classical music that has some kind of a story line or a theme like Beethoven's Pastoral and things like that where you can	3929	A
follow um through some of the mood of the of the melodies and not just have um you know a kind of mathematical arrangement of the notes which is	3929	A
also fascinating many times but i like that break of a kind of a story line sometimes what kind of uh pieces are your favorites	3929	A
uh-huh	3929	A
oh yeah uh-huh	3929	A
uh-huh what about Gershwin	3929	A
um-hum	3929	A
um-hum	3929	A
um-hum um	3929	A
um-hum	3929	A
uh-huh	3929	A
um-hum	3929	A
um-hum	3929	A
um-hum	3929	A
uh-huh	3929	A
uh-huh	3929	A
oh really	3929	A
um-hum	3929	A
oh	3929	A
um-hum	3929	A
how old are your children	3929	A
oh isn't that wonderful though	3929	A
um-hum	3929	A
um-hum	3929	A
i bet it is now i have never heard them um that Myerson auditorium is really is really quite acoustically beautiful i- i have to admit that um	3929	A
i had the privilege of going to the uh piano concert that uh Yefgenya Chessum who is a young uh Russian artist gave i guess it was just before Christmas time	3929	A
and i'm telling- and and it was no orchestra- -orchestra or anything it was just he	3929	A
and yes and i'm telling you the sound the sound was so	3929	A
so perfect uh i- i had heard you know the orchestra the symphony and we went for the toy symphony and the young children's um uh uh orchestra from SMU and	3929	A
several things down there this is the first time i just heard like one artist and-	3929	A
i don't Vinny i'm a a CPA and this time of year i'm dang busy but uh i do do a lot of exercise in the spring and summer and in the fall	3981	A
well i don't- i don't go to a to- uh health club and work out and things of that nature but i- i run a lot	3981	A
i usually try to get uh oh about three mornings	3981	A
three mornings a week where i run two two miles a day	3981	A
yeah how about yourself	3981	A
um-hum	3981	A
um-hum	3981	A
yes um-hum	3981	A
um-hum uh do you uh pump iron or what kind of uh	3981	A
um-hum um-hum	3981	A
um-hum	3981	A
um-hum	3981	A
hum	3981	A
uh what-	3981	A
i i've never been around weights much is how how's a dead weight help you versus the machine type	3981	A
um-hum	3981	A
oh	3981	A
yeah	3981	A
uh-huh	3981	A
right uh-huh	3981	A
equalize that or	3981	A
right	3981	A
um-hum	3981	A
um-hum	3981	A
yeah	3981	A
uh-huh	3981	A
huh-uh	3981	A
um-hum	3981	A
yes	3981	A
hum	3981	A
what do you uh do you work your cardiovascular system at all other than the running how do you	3981	A
you know get your	3981	A
heart rate up for a while	3981	A
i was just wondering how you get your heart rate up or does pumping iron do that	3981	A
um-hum	3981	A
okay	3981	A
um-hum	3981	A
um-hum	3981	A
that's incredible	3981	A
um-hum	3981	A
yes	3981	A
huh	3981	A
yeah	3981	A
huh do	3981	A
do do do your muscles uh do do you lose the tone fast do you lose the strength in them_1 fairly quickly or	3981	A
uh-huh	3981	A
um-hum	3981	A
um-hum	3981	A
so you uh exercise on a regular basis	3981	B
uh-huh what kind of exercise do you do	3981	B
um-hum	3981	B
um-hum	3981	B
oh that's not bad um-hum	3981	B
well i uh i like to run but uh i have problems with my back hurting so uh i run i if i run it's usually short durations and i only do it when i can't you know get out of the house um	3981	B
there you know to go because_1 i usually work out in a health club and uh i try to work out like every other day and sometimes when it's like a really nice day outside i don't feel like going inside to work out then i go ahead and run for short duration	3981	B
yeah i use i like to do uh free weights	3981	B
because_1 uh i found certain parts of my body developed better than other parts of my body so uh instead of they you know they have like different circuits and they tell you to work every single muscle in your body and uh i hate working a muscle that you know just won't develop	3981	B
so uh i've i've gotten uh i've adapted to uh a routine and i like to work my arms and my chest and my stomach and everything else just seems to stay the same no matter what i do to it	3981	B
so those are what i like to work out the most and you know i get a pretty decent workout with my legs um just you know on occasion running but or you know just running around what i do everyday so	3981	B
well sometimes- what happens is sometimes uh now different machines i guess uh work different ways but uh the way i look at it if sometimes the machine like you know one hand can put more force can put more force than the other one	3981	B
so sometimes you end up working out one hand more than the other or one leg more than the other because the machine averages the weights out	3981	B
because_1 you're pulling like the same set of weights out now they they have different machines that will uh	3981	B
um	3981	B
right they have what they have like a uh weight- weight for one side and a weight for the other side and that's you know better than uh than like a universal set usually has like one set of weights that you know you do for both of them	3981	B
um	3981	B
but even then uh i i'd like to think the free weights simulate a live a real world situation better	3981	B
you know like uh just like a friend of mine used to tell me he goes uh if you work out with free weights you know and a car falls on you think the free weights going to give you better uh	3981	B
better idea of what's gonna happen rather than if you work out with uh you know with some kind of machine	3981	B
but uh the machines the one thing the machines do do that the free weights don't do is they focus on a specific muscle or muscle group	3981	B
which is something i don't think you will get out of the free weights because_1 the free weights just kind of work your whole body i guess or a whole area as opposed to like one spot because_1 if you get like a particular Nautilus machine or something	3981	B
yeah- you can get it like down to you know the very last muscle down there	3981	B
so it works pretty good	3981	B
um that	3981	B
i'm sorry say that one more time	3981	B
oh no usually what i do is when i get to the uh i- i usually like run around the track they have a track there	3981	B
i run around the track uh you know uh maybe like it's a tenth of a mile all the way around so i just run real slow you know maybe do a couple of laps just enough to get my heart rate going	3981	B
and uh after that then i just go ahead and just get in my routine i do uh i do my um my sit ups first	3981	B
and that also uh that gets my heart rate going too and then i- i don't pump iron until maybe like halfway through and then i sit down and start doing the the free weights	3981	B
and then i usually run before i leave to kind of relax me a little bit	3981	B
yeah so it- it works out okay i haven't uh i the problem is you know i get into it and i work out for three months four months in a row get in great shape and then you know i'll have a business conference i usually go overseas twice or three times a year	3981	B
and to attend these conferences and they kill me you you travel you eat a lot you um it messes up you know your uh biological clock you know	3981	B
and uh it just screws you up completely and by the time you come back you don't feel like working out you know	3981	B
well uh	3981	B
i you- you don't lose strength i don't think you lose a little bit of tone	3981	B
um but you get back into it and you know it doesn't take very long to build it back up	3981	B
but uh i don't think you know they say you get flabby if you you know the more you work out and you get all big muscles and stuff and then also when you stop they say you get flabby when you get older you know	3981	B
well it may happen but like i said it's easy to develop them_1 because if i lose if i lose tone you know by not working out uh over a period of a week or two	3981	B
well the topic is is very apropos to what's going on um how do you feel about our topic	3992	A
yes	3992	A
um i think that's because uh it's like i told someone the other day i'm a housewife and uh among uh working mother too and i know how it is to live on a budget and i hear what you're saying	3992	A
yeah our taxes it's nice to see them_1 spent for things that benefit the community but when we see them wasted that's when we think we're paying too much	3992	A
um-hum	3992	A
um	3992	A
yeah	3992	A
well i think uh in a way that's that's uh almost off our topic in you know in that uh they didn't want us to talk about how it was spent but i don't think you can separate it	3992	A
i know um i felt very fortunate once when i talked with a lady from England and she said their taxes are at least fifty percent	3992	A
and uh in talking to people i've met from other places uh we do seem to get off light	3992	A
that's	3992	A
oh yeah um-hum	3992	A
in the other countries	3992	A
um-hum	3992	A
yeah	3992	A
well on national health so many of them_1 can't use it they say because they never can get in to see their doctors	3992	A
at least in England	3992	A
um-hum	3992	A
yeah	3992	A
um-hum	3992	A
yeah	3992	A
um-hum	3992	A
i hope it doesn't i uh i hope not but i don't see any way out of it unless we start cutting some spending drastically	3992	A
yeah	3992	A
course i- i think the sales tax is about the most equitable tax there is	3992	A
because if you don't uh buy and participate you don't have to have to pay it	3992	A
and uh that way people who use the facilities and live outside of the area basically help pay some of the upkeep for it	3992	A
um-hum	3992	A
and how much is spent to administrate administrate them_1	3992	A
yeah	3992	A
um-hum	3992	A
um-hum	3992	A
um-hum	3992	A
yeah	3992	A
that's right	3992	A
yeah and and one of the things that makes it so hard on these people they slap so much penalty and interest on it	3992	A
that they can triple it in nothing flat	3992	A
um-hum	3992	A
right	3992	A
um-hum	3992	A
well i feel like uh i do feel like we pay a lot of taxes i don't mind paying a lot of taxes if the taxes- taxes are spent well	3992	B
but uh i'm not convinced that they're being spent well um	3992	B
um-hum	3992	B
um-hum um-hum	3992	B
well i feel i- i mean one of the things is when it's- it it's not going it's going into a lot of military stuff which is badly spent	3992	B
and not going into a lot of infrastructure things uh or or um you know social needs	3992	B
that that it could i mean when you look at the pie it's it of where our money is spent it's it's uh very very um skewed	3992	B
and uh so i don't feel like i- i just don't feel like they're doing what i would do with it	3992	B
uh-huh	3992	B
well uh but the people who pay a lot of taxes also get a lot of services they have national health	3992	B
so you know uh	3992	B
in other words yes that's why i say	3992	B
yeah so i'm saying if we did i wouldn't mind paying what we pay	3992	B
or even more if i got a lot of stuff back for it	3992	B
but uh	3992	B
yeah	3992	B
i we hear that here uh some although we get some people who obviously don't want it like	3992	B
like rich doctors	3992	B
who who'd rather us not have it i think but i don't know i- i just and local taxes um i think are probably	3992	B
just about the same you know the school- the school taxes and all of that income tax of course is not a a topic in in Texas yet but i'm sure it's coming	3992	B
yeah-	3992	B
no	3992	B
that's true i've lived in uh states where they had income tax and you you know and you just get used to it	3992	B
but uh again- again um	3992	B
it just depends on what they're what it's being spent on	3992	B
um	3992	B
yeah and sometimes and sometimes i think it does work that way um	3992	B
but they you know uh	3992	B
uh again it's it's you- you you have the different kind of taxes then then then what are they being used for and who is deciding what they are being used for	3992	B
right	3992	B
all those people are doing those things and and and i know that the stories i mean i personally know people who have been in this place where you know they they're having trouble paying their taxes and they	3992	B
uh like you would with a bank you know go into the IRS and say you know you can you can do all this stuff to me and get nothing or give me you know let me pay this out and you'll get it all	3992	B
and they'll say no you know and i think now- wait a minute that was my money you said no with well well- well you're not going to get it all uh	3992	B
um-hum	3992	B
yeah i mean it's the one place that there's no recourse at all	3992	B
and a lot of people aren't trying to get out of it but trying to figure a way to live and pay it back	3992	B
and they just they don't accept that at all so	3992	B
well have you had to return any uh merchandise recently	3935	A
yeah	3935	A
yeah it's interesting- it's interesting i really hadn't even given any thought at all to things like buttons and seams but	3935	A
i guess i've just begun to take that for advantage that buttons are not gonna be sewn on i mean took that for uh granted that buttons are not gonna be sewn on very well	3935	A
yeah well- you- you're right you're right	3935	A
yeah yeah no i- i agree with you	3935	A
yeah	3935	A
uh-huh	3935	A
yeah one of my pet peeves is uh neckties- uh neckties you know they're just uh uh a nice silk necktie is astronomical	3935	A
and it has this little um you know sewn on bar on the back of the tie that you tuck it in you know after you've tied it and those little those little some of them_1 bars will- inevitably come loose- loose- loose	3935	A
and it drags- it just drives me crazy i mean it's an integral part of the tie and it wouldn't take you know what a half a penny of good thread to put it on there securely so um anyway yeah that's uh that	3935	A
yeah	3935	A
well yeah	3935	A
yeah i- i will i will tell you my experience with appliances Joan has been that uh well what happened to me i had a a stereo	3935	A
that i uh um receiver- receiver amplifier that i really liked and it started messing up so i took it to the shop and the minimum charge to even look at it was fifty bucks	3935	A
but i you know rationalized and i thought well even if i spend you know seventy five dollars that's cheaper than buying a new one so i wound up spending the nearly a hundred dollars on it	3935	A
took it home it worked maybe two weeks and exactly the same thing happened to it so i took it back to the shop	3935	A
and you know bottom line is i went through all this gyration and and aggravation and unhooking it and hooking it back up and hauling it back and forth to the repair shop	3935	A
eventually it never worked right again and i- i wound up buying a new one i had similar- i had a similar thing happen with a television and i'm about i- i just came to the conclusion with electronics anyway	3935	A
you know if they break throw them_1 away go get a new it	3935	A
yeah you know and and i think you're better off in the long run just to chunk it and get a new one but i- i will have to say you know if you think about things like uh	3935	A
as much as stereos for example i can remember the first one i bought whenever i was in college i mean i paid a fortune for it	3935	A
well that's true as a matter of fact my i gave the amp to my little brother and he's still using it yeah that is true i'll have- i'll have to admit but they have come down in price but there again they're they're made a lot cheaper	3935	A
uh-huh	3935	A
uh-huh	3935	A
so	3935	A
yeah so yeah and i- i agree with you if we had done it i would have felt maybe it was biased which that's a terrible thing to say but well i don't know it's um it we're living in an interesting time i mean certainly the Japanese have shown that	3935	A
you know they can really produce some quality merchandise and at the same time um	3935	A
i think what it's forced uh American manufacturing to realize is that they're gonna	3935	A
yeah i did i just had to return a pair of shorts i bought for Christmas a winter pair of shorts	3935	B
and the seam was out on the the zipper went out on it right away pulled out	3935	B
and the buttons were loose on it and it was from you know a nice department store	3935	B
and um	3935	B
i guess that's true but it you know you think back and you didn't have to do replace buttons or anything	3935	B
very long ago it wasn't	3935	B
but anymore it's pretty common that you do but when the zipper went on this one i said that's it	3935	B
that you know that really did it	3935	B
yeah	3935	B
um-hum	3935	B
right	3935	B
um-hum	3935	B
um-hum	3935	B
yeah	3935	B
i know it	3935	B
right	3935	B
yeah	3935	B
yeah there are a lot and and how about_1 uh any appliances i've had that happen with Sunbeam- no i'm disgusted i have a Sunbeam beater that we've taken back three times and Sunbeam always had a good name	3935	B
now that just really shocks me but i'll tell you that thing hasn't i burnt the motor out twice and i cooked once at Christmas so that's about it anymore	3935	B
but i bake and i'm very disgusted with them_1	3935	B
um-hum	3935	B
um	3935	B
yeah sure	3935	B
um-hum	3935	B
um	3935	B
um	3935	B
uh-huh	3935	B
um-hum	3935	B
huh huh huh	3935	B
right	3935	B
and go ahead and get a new one anyway you got a lemon	3935	B
yeah	3935	B
yeah	3935	B
yeah but yeah	3935	B
um-hum	3935	B
and you had it forever though	3935	B
right	3935	B
right	3935	B
yeah	3935	B
yeah	3935	B
yeah they've come a long way with the difference in the i heard an interesting thing on this morning on the radio to going to work about the Japanese you know they have that big thing about the consumers	3935	B
and how many more hours they work on it and um	3935	B
they were saying that they did a study on it and the Japanese actually uh i mean the United States actually produces six point five percent more product	3935	B
in the time um more products	3935	B
than the Japanese do and the Japanese take twice as much time and work but they don't get the productivity- productivity out of it	3935	B
and that they do because of the hours they put in that that's what they loose- they loose and i thought it was very interesting and they said in the and the unique part of it is that the Japanese are the ones	3935	B
that um did the study it wasn't as though we were doing it to show them they did the study so i got- i got- i got a big kick out of that one	3935	B
yeah yeah	3935	B
yeah yeah	3935	B
um-hum	3935	B
have any great vacation spots to share with me	3927	A
oh boy	3927	A
where in Europe	3927	A
where in Europe did you go	3927	A
wow	3927	A
that's not	3927	A
you say you were there for five years	3927	A
oh five days uh-huh	3927	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3927	A
i'm sorry i interrupted you you was always saying- also saying that you'd gone to Rio	3927	A
that's wonderful	3927	A
um-hum	3927	A
so a lot- lot of your big vacations have been international	3927	A
that's wonderful	3927	A
do you like to travel domestically as well do you do you take vacations around the country now	3927	A
uh-huh	3927	A
yes i can relate to that	3927	A
oh yes	3927	A
did you ski when you were there	3927	A
in Vail	3927	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3927	A
it's true it's true	3927	A
yours are much more exciting than mine um i think probably finances have limited us um primarily my family um	3927	A
because i'm the oldest when i left	3927	A
um my family went on some really fun vacations so it's more the things that i've done with my husband and and more recently our child that uh	3927	A
that we that i could probably talk about	3927	A
well i'm not actually i just started my family younger i mean started my family later um	3927	A
i'm thirty six and my daughter's only	3927	A
my-	3927	A
well but my daughter's only two so at my age i think that my my mother	3927	A
i mean when my mother was my age i think that i was probably twelve or something like that	3927	A
it	3927	A
right	3927	A
at any rate we've really enjoyed camping vacations i think that that's probably the thing that we've uh done most each year probably four to seven times a year we'll take short short little vacations maybe three days maybe four days	3927	A
and there's so many places in the San Francisco Bay area that you can camp that you don't really have to go very far you can drive as little as an hour and get into a redwood forest and feel like you're just	3927	A
it is really nice to have that very close	3927	A
um there are some places up the coast near Mendocino and in Marin that have what they call environmental cabins so	3927	A
you can rent them fairly inexpensively and stay a couple nights and feel like you have a little beach house getaway	3927	A
so we've done that a few times too you know it's very rustic you don't you bring all your own things and you bring your your your cooler almost as if you were camping but there's a stove and there's a	3927	A
a table and and uh platforms for your bed mattress and that sort of thing so it's somewhat set up	3927	A
those we've really enjoyed i think what i'd like to do when our daughter's a little older	3927	A
and if we have other kids its uh the kind of club made med vacations that my husband and i enjoyed several years ago because there's so many different activities	3927	A
yes they call them club kids	3927	A
yes they have all kinds of art activities and sports that are tailored for kids and babysitters if you have children that are you know infants-	3927	A
uh well most	3927	B
i'm fifty three most of my big vacations i think are probably in the past i've been you know to Europe a couple of times and	3927	B
and to	3927	B
Rio huh	3927	B
oh okay uh England uh Holland France	3927	B
uh one of the interesting- most interesting ones was Berlin we were there for five years and this was back in eighty five before you know the wall came down	3927	B
so that was very interesting to go into	3927	B
you know a Communist country and all that course it's kind of laughable now but you know that's the way it was then	3927	B
five days i'm	3927	B
five days	3927	B
my husband's brother was the commander of the Air Force base in Berlin	3927	B
and so we were visiting them	3927	B
yeah uh another brother all my my brothers and sisters used to live in all these interesting places uh they're all retired and back in the states now but one lived in Rio and that was	3927	B
we went there for about ten days and that was quite a beautiful place	3927	B
and uh so	3927	B
to	3927	B
yeah and to visit relatives my brother worked lived in Jamaica for a number of years so we went there you know for a week so uh	3927	B
and-	3927	B
we're caught in this economic crunch	3927	B
we also had a time share condo if you're familiar with those so we used and it was our home unit was in Vail Colorado	3927	B
and then if you didn't want to go there you could switch and go actually anywhere -anywhere in the world and-	3927	B
uh	3927	B
yeah a little but we waited we were too old when we started going to really learn the you know like our children learned well and skied well but you know	3927	B
you- that's something you really i think should learn when you're younger	3927	B
now i've done all the talking you tell me what you've done	3927	B
well you're much younger what age are you	3927	B
oh	3927	B
well that is young go ahead	3927	B
yeah but- but that was the trend back then you know	3927	B
you had your children in the early twenties	3927	B
oh	3927	B
oh and such beautiful country up around you	3927	B
oh	3927	B
right	3927	B
oh	3927	B
um-hum and and they you can take children now can't you	3927	B
yeah okay i knew i knew something about that uh-huh	3927	B
okay	3968	A
i know i guess that	3968	A
i guess you consider just things that every day that would you'd think of about see i'm a college student so i can think of lots of things that my roommate does that bother me	3968	A
you know that i think's like is an invasion of my privacy stuff like that but i think it'd be it is kind of a tough topic	3968	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3968	A
uh-huh	3968	A
oh gosh- you're like no you don't no	3968	A
uh-huh	3968	A
yeah	3968	A
they call late now i mean now there's i heard that they were going to start calling on Saturdays or something-	3968	A
see that's ridiculous- i would be so mad	3968	A
really	3968	A
huh	3968	A
huh	3968	A
really huh i don't know i'd think like things that that i think's like privacy is like just like not going through my stuff but like going through just like my clothes or my drawer just going through my stuff basically	3968	A
that drives me up a wall	3968	A
no see we're not and uh	3968	A
yeah she'll take all my shirts and stuff because she can't wear like my pants but she'll take all my shirts and my blouses and stuff	3968	A
man i'm just glad she can't wear my pants or my skirts or my dresses you know	3968	A
but still she'll just take them and she won't even think about it and then i'll like see her that day and she'll be wearing my clothes and i'll be like you know i don't like to borrow my clothes out you know i really don't	3968	A
so i prefer that you just not go in and get them because_1 she doesn't even ask me	3968	A
stuff like that really like that's an invasion of my privacy i feel like	3968	A
stuff like that when you have your door closed people just walking in and stuff like that	3968	A
i was thinking like my mom i know this she would think this is like an invasion of her privacy is like going through her purse like if you ever needed money and stuff we always just give her her purse you know and she'll get it out or whatever	3968	A
i was trying to think i was thinking that's the only thing i could really think of that would really be	3968	A
really	3968	A
uh-huh	3968	A
yeah get out of my cabinets	3968	A
that's great	3968	A
uh-huh	3968	A
see	3968	A
yeah	3968	A
you could tell- you know you put your stuff where it's yeah	3968	A
that would drive- that would that-	3968	A
really	3968	A
uh-huh	3968	A
uh-huh	3968	A
uh-huh	3968	A
yeah	3968	A
then you start missing stuff and	3968	A
that's okay	3968	A
see that would that would make me really mad because_1 you can always tell when someone's touched your stuff just because_1 i mean i know i have everything like a certain way	3968	A
and you know how it looks and everything	3968	A
uh-huh	3968	A
that would bother me definitely	3968	A
uh-huh	3968	A
see yeah	3968	A
you just- know that's the only thing i can really think about being an invasion of privacy like something every day though	3968	A
uh-huh	3968	A
oh really	3968	A
uh-huh	3968	A
all right that's a real different topic i'm not sure i'm familiar with	3968	B
with what they mean of invasion of privacy	3968	B
yeah	3968	B
yeah	3968	B
i think personally you know i'm i'm i used to be a college student ten years ago but uh now i think an invasion of my privacy is when someone calls me on the telephone	3968	B
and says Mrs Miller have we got a deal for you	3968	B
it's like how do you know my name where did you get my phone number and why do you think it's a deal for me	3968	B
i mean those people they'll call you any time of the day or night with try to solicit and that's an invasion of my privacy i think	3968	B
oh they do already	3968	B
well and i've even had the computer generated calls on Sundays too	3968	B
um-hum	3968	B
but i do know of a way to get around the computer generated calls	3968	B
but don't answer your phone hello the computer's geared to to start talking to you on the on the word hello	3968	B
uh-huh	3968	B
oh yeah oh yeah	3968	B
are you and your roommate a similar size	3968	B
and she still goes through your clothes	3968	B
uh-huh	3968	B
ooh	3968	B
oh yeah	3968	B
uh-huh	3968	B
uh-huh	3968	B
oh yeah i agree	3968	B
um-hum	3968	B
oh yeah	3968	B
yeah	3968	B
uh-huh	3968	B
my mom doesn't even like for us to go through her cabinets	3968	B
i mean we're all grown all her kids are grown and we have our own families and now if we go through her cabinets she's like well what are you digging for	3968	B
yeah like what are you doing don't you have your own house to dig through	3968	B
yeah so	3968	B
i guess that privacy is really	3968	B
and at the work place i suppose oh well actually yes i can say definitely that privacy at the work place i hate it for people to open up my drawer to my desk	3968	B
because that was that was where i kept all my stuff and i could tell i mean even if a pen was turned the wrong way oh yeah	3968	B
it would drive it drove me batty for a while yeah well i worked a second shift	3968	B
and everybody else in my area worked first shift and our shifts overlapped	3968	B
so i would come in and there would be people sitting at my desk working	3968	B
and i'm wondering you know um	3968	B
what is this <b_aside> it's my vitamins <e_aside>	3968	B
i wonder what is you know yeah what is why are they working at my desk and can i have it back	3968	B
can i have it back soon maybe	3968	B
oh yeah <b_aside> no mommy is going to take the vitamins <e_aside>	3968	B
i'm sorry i have a small person	3968	B
yeah	3968	B
<b_aside> switchboard call <e_aside>	3968	B
oh yeah well you know how you left it the day before	3968	B
oh yeah	3968	B
so that's	3968	B
yeah i agree it's it's pretty tough that way	3968	B
and	3968	B
i know even like with your school books and paper	3968	B
do you miss your papers sometimes	3968	B
uh-huh huh	3968	B
yeah well actually i do know and i have used it once and it it really is an invasion of privacy but	3968	B
in the library there's a book that you can find out what people's phone numbers are by where they live by their street address yeah	3968	B
and that i mean i've i've used it once	3968	B
i'm i'm ready	3946	A
okay well i don't have an elderly person that i could send to a a nursing home or anything my both of my parents are dead	3946	A
but i did have a friend that was in a convalescent home uh like a nursing home	3946	A
and i had- went there very often to visit her and uh	3946	A
made me feel really sad if i did have a mother living i don't think i could do that	3946	A
i think they would be better off being at home with their family	3946	A
you know	3946	A
uh-huh	3946	A
um-hum	3946	A
um-hum	3946	A
um-hum	3946	A
oh i can believe that yes because most elderly people can't take having a lot of noise and kids running around and things like that in a situation like that maybe it would be better	3946	A
um-hum	3946	A
oh yeah	3946	A
um-hum	3946	A
oh	3946	A
uh-huh	3946	A
oh see now that's that's that's really a sad situation	3946	A
yeah really you know i just	3946	A
um-hum	3946	A
yeah right right	3946	A
yeah in a case like that you know you more or less think it it would be better if she were in a nursing home because you have your family growing up where	3946	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3946	A
uh-huh but the cost of these nursing homes are so	3946	A
you know a lot of people can't afford that	3946	A
you know so you really have no choice that way if you you know if you're not rich or something- you know um	3946	A
i know this lady that you know that was a friend of mine now her husband was still alive at the time when she was in there you know and it was costing him a small fortune to keep her in there	3946	A
so	3946	A
um-hum	3946	A
yeah then bring her back home at night	3946	A
um-hum um-hum	3946	A
yeah you know just come home for dinner and then usually they want to go to bed pretty early anyhow you know so that would probably be nice if we could ever get something like that but	3946	A
right	3946	A
um-hum	3946	A
um-hum	3946	A
um-hum	3946	A
um-hum um-hum	3946	A
hm	3946	A
um-hum	3946	A
yeah	3946	A
if if they don't know anybody and they don't know what's going on around them and everything like that well i can see maybe a nursing home would be better you know	3946	A
but if they they have their wits about them_1 and everything why	3946	A
it's kind of hard	3946	A
um-hum um-hum	3946	A
um-hum um-hum	3946	A
well uh my mother always said she hopes she never had to be like that and	3946	A
uh luckily i mean she lived by herself and then you know one day she had a heart attack and she was gone so she never did have to go into a nursing home or anything like that but there's	3946	A
so many of us kids there was like seven of us that my we wouldn't have probably allowed that to happen anyhow	3946	A
you know she could've taken turns living with each one of us you know for a short- a short- a period of time because_1 we all don't live in the same city anyhow or- nor the same state	3946	A
so	3946	A
uh uh a couple- i have a couple more that live out here in California but then i have a brother-	3946	A
why don't you go ahead and start off	3946	B
i agree although we're in that situation right now we have a an eighty seven year old mother-in-law living with me right now	3946	B
and because of her circumstances she can no longer live independently	3946	B
and even moving from her house to our house has been tremendously unsettling for her and we have several young children and they about drive her crazy	3946	B
well we've you know we've struggled a lot with it because_1 again uh most of the nursing homes i've been in are very depressing to me	3946	B
and she's still alert enough that i think she would really know that we were putting her there and i think she'd really resent it	3946	B
and i think that would make it very hard but on the other hand i see my wife with i guess our youngest one now is five	3946	B
and her trying to struggle because her mother really cannot take care of herself she needs to be bathed and dressed and a lot of those kinds of things	3946	B
and so the drain on the family	3946	B
and when the kids have kids come over you know she's always saying well why do they have to be here why can't they send them home it's too noisy and she'll say that to the kid's friends	3946	B
so it's a hard situation either way i think	3946	B
and i think that's one of the things we're really wrestling with when does it become detrimental to our family to the point that you have to consider that as opposed to considering her current circumstances and	3946	B
oh prohibitive	3946	B
yeah	3946	B
yeah	3946	B
i think we need to develop some alternatives like adult day care	3946	B
that's more readily available you know i think if we could send her someplace for the day	3946	B
and she could be around some elderly people and have some activities would be of more interest to her and then in the evening have her return and be with the family	3946	B
yeah	3946	B
but there's not many of those available right now and they're very hard to get them_1 into and	3946	B
we tried sending her to a senior citizen center but they're really not prepared to cope with her because she's somewhat senile and so a lot of the activities that they're engaged in she can't participate in	3946	B
but i think it's an issue that you know with the graying of America we're really going to have to as a as a country figure out how we're going to deal with this	3946	B
because it is a difficult situation and you know you hate seeing them just sort of send off and not well cared for	3946	B
and yet	3946	B
and then i think it depends on their physical ability too you know if they could be up and doing some things it might be better than when they're just sort of needing almost constant supervision and care	3946	B
yeah	3946	B
do you live at all close to each other	3946	B
and how's your weather been	3904	A
well this is getting to be uh similar to the reason i moved away from Saint Louis all these gray gloomy rainy days you know	3904	A
but uh i've been here for about uh well it's going on five years now and this is definitely the rainiest January February	3904	A
well i thought it was bad enough about four years ago when we had the was it three or four years ago when we had the big ice storm	3904	A
yeah	3904	A
you've been here a while then	3904	A
oh okay	3904	A
gosh i think you're the first person from Colorado i have ever heard that didn't say oh it's wonderful it's so dry here	3904	A
well this actually isn't far enough south for me	3904	A
i would like to get down to oh Tampa some place like that where	3904	A
at least yes	3904	A
is that down the coast of Florida	3904	A
okay	3904	A
no i think it's a couple hours drive if i	3904	A
uh you may have been speeding a little bit though	3904	A
i see	3904	A
is that right	3904	A
do they arrest people there uh unlike Dallas	3904	A
maybe	3904	A
well uh i'll tell you i will definitely take the hot summers	3904	A
no kidding	3904	A
i'll bet you just did all kinds of business	3904	A
um-hum	3904	A
um-hum	3904	A
um-hum	3904	A
yes	3904	A
oh i'll bet	3904	A
well my weather right now is rainy uh this is the most rain i think we've ever seen uh over a twelve month period of time since i moved to- to uh to the Texas area	3904	B
um i was uh i've seen climates both rather arid and and and complete and total uh tropical so i've seen kind of the gamut but this is starting to lean towards the uh the tropical end how about you	3904	B
oh my uh-huh	3904	B
uh-huh oh this is this is a neat year- you missed the nineteen eighty eighty one uh uh mess	3904	B
the nineteen eighty summer that about roasted everybody and then the eighty one spring that uh where practically every lake in uh North North Texas overflowed	3904	B
i mean we	3904	B
oh yes ma'am well that was that was pretty good uh however the one in seventy nine and uh and uh seventy eight and seventy nine uh dwarfed that one	3904	B
yes ma'am since uh you know i have been well the firm i am with uh i've been with them them for twenty three years so and they are in the North Texas area	3904	B
so uh	3904	B
yeah i have seen quite a bit of of weather uh patterns of course like i say uh when i was in the service i got to see plenty of um	3904	B
different uh locals as far as wet and dry uh climates and uh	3904	B
uh i was kind of like you i'm i didn't want to go back to Colorado because of the different- because of the tremendous weather we had	3904	B
um no no no	3904	B
oh okay	3904	B
Tampa Florida	3904	B
uh-huh well let's see my in-laws uh winter in uh the Leesburg area	3904	B
well it's uh in the Orlando area	3904	B
and Tampa Saint Petersburg is not that super far away	3904	B
yeah something like that i think we made to from their house to uh Bush Gardens in ninety minutes that day	3904	B
no no no no no no no not not at that not down that uh uh tollway they've got	3904	B
they're they're smokies you think our smokies are bad with with uh uh our uh little Mustangs that are hot rods they got them_1 there too oh yeah	3904	B
i know we uh were uh	3904	B
over run by one in uh we went down for Christmas and we were cruising- cruising along in our little rental car and uh this this this car comes over the hill and pass me and it was one of those	3904	B
puppies and he was flat moving	3904	B
yeah yeah he's he he pulled one he pulled one over and was uh steady having a little chat about something other than the weather that's for sure	3904	B
because_1 i mean he didn't look happy when we went by	3904	B
so i don't know maybe it was uh	3904	B
who knows but anyway this weather here is is certainly evolved from a from a dryer hotter uh nineteen eighty	3904	B
to uh the present- the the last summer we had i think we barely what cleared a hundred	3904	B
i think that was stretching it	3904	B
oh well believe you me i'm not not advocating cold summers no no no no no no no wrong wrong wrong but uh	3904	B
uh the summer of nineteen eighty we saw one hundred fifteen and one hundred sixteen and i was running a little heating and air-conditioning business at the time	3904	B
well uh	3904	B
what happened there was that most of our customer- everybody's customers uh down here about April start to call call everybody- you know call their their local guys	3904	B
and we go out and tune up the systems	3904	B
and we are normally expecting some a hundred hundred degree days so we tune for that	3904	B
so we had everybody nice in tune when the hundred and fifteen degree weather hit	3904	B
and so what- the only thing that got replaced were the weak systems	3904	B
you know that would barely make it at one hundred but when the hundred and fifteen degree days hit well it just couldn't couldn't handle the load and they then they then the compressors blew like popcorn	3904	B
i mean just this pop pop bang bang	3904	B
do you feel you're paying too much in tax	3906	B
yeah	3906	B
i think you're right there uh it might be a little more ruthless uh to go with the free enterprise system the government has a sort- sort of a habit of investing in things that don't pay much return	3906	B
and into- getting into projects that uh there is no yield on the investment so it's all money down the rat hole	3906	B
um-hum	3906	B
no i'm uh sort of in Fairfax County working for uh one of the uh free loaders on the government uh government contract uh group uh	3906	B
so you know somebody once accused uh accused us of uh uh being a welfare program for engineers	3906	B
um-hum	3906	B
yeah	3906	B
um-hum	3906	B
well i think my father went through his life saying that he just keeps paying taxes and paying taxes and paying taxes	3906	B
uh	3906	B
yeah	3906	B
well the welfare is a good example that uh	3906	B
you know if if welfare is handled at the local level by small groups like the churches and some of the organized charities that that get people involved directly	3906	B
uh then the money gets right straight to the people and there's a lot of volunteer work and and supporting that type of operation	3906	B
but you let the government handle it and next thing you know you're spending four out of five dollars just to administer it	3906	B
and it just seems like nothing gets down to the people	3906	B
huh	3906	B
um-hum	3906	B
yeah	3906	B
yeah well i'm afraid they may have a more bureaucratic system than we do	3906	B
uh i think one of my biggest concern on taxes is uh real estate uh taxes down at the local level the federal government seems to be pretty stable you know you can figure out what they're gonna charge you next year	3906	B
but uh since i moved into this house five years ago the real estate tax has doubled	3906	B
and i'm just afraid that by the time i'm ready to retire and uh the mortgage is paid off on this house i won't be able to afford the taxes on it	3906	B
yeah well that was true on the last house i bought i got a thirty year mortgage on it and by the time i uh sold it the the tax payment was a bigger part of the uh	3906	B
of the mortgage payment yeah	3906	B
and i figure it just says that uh when i'm ready to retire i'm gonna have to move out of Fairfax County and get out in the country some place	3906	B
uh and there's no control over it uh the accessors just come around and say okay you're assessment just went up twenty thirty percent and uh	3906	B
you know there's no recourse	3906	B
well the property taxes are supposed to pay for education and some of the county services	3906	B
uh and i- i hope that some of that is working efficiently we have a pretty good school system	3906	B
i'm a little concerned that there's too much paper work there for them_1	3906	B
oh i always feel i'm paying too much for everything that's part of my problem	3906	A
i wonder if we wouldn't be better off um	3906	A
you know with a little more free enterprise than having the government do some much for us	3906	A
that's what my i don't know those are some of my feelings i think free enterprise does it for a better price	3906	A
yeah	3906	A
yeah it doesn't it doesn't seem like we really get our uh i don't know i- i don't think we get the best for the buck if that's if that's a good way to put it but	3906	A
um uh do you now do you live close to uh uh you know to a government installation of any kind or	3906	A
oh okay so you know it from the contract side	3906	A
yeah my father worked uh for the government uh	3906	A
here in Utah at the Hill Air Force Base where i mean you know that was the occupation that he had all the time i was growing up and	3906	A
and we got a good living out of it but i know just from talking with him there were it was like you said there are a lot of things that go on that just- just make you wonder	3906	A
that they don't really even get the best out of the people that are working for them_1 so it makes me wonder where we're where we're going with that	3906	A
yeah	3906	A
well they uh uh yeah they- they- they provide a lot of services that we don't	3906	A
you- you know that we don't really see or notice i guess but it just seemed like if if we had you know some kind of a private enterprise system	3906	A
um-hum	3906	A
um-hum	3906	A
yeah	3906	A
yeah i	3906	A
i think i think that's a really good point because_1 i- i- i think you know welfare is one of the one of the big problems	3906	A
and it it's interesting that in	3906	A
uh in a way it's interesting to me that that like in the foreign in Russia and those kind- areas where they're having their struggles right now you know they're gonna have to have a welfare system	3906	A
in order for- in order to improve their life over there and i i hope they don't pattern theirs after our	3906	A
um-hum	3906	A
um	3906	A
your monthly taxes will be as high as your monthly payment	3906	A
yeah that is the	3906	A
hm that that is scary because_1 that really makes you wonder what they're doing with that i	3906	A
um-hum	3906	A
and what what do you think you get out of your taxes your property taxes	3906	A
um-hum	3906	A
what kind of camping do you do down there	3995	A
um-hum	3995	A
do you	3995	A
do you have a camp trailer or do you just take tents and sleeping bags um-hum	3995	A
take the whole family	3995	A
um-hum	3995	A
um-hum	3995	A
um-hum	3995	A
um-hum	3995	A
um-hum um-hum	3995	A
do- do you go up in the mountains or mainly stay in campgrounds	3995	A
you basically just go with the KOA campgrounds or something like that	3995	A
um-hum	3995	A
um-hum	3995	A
um-hum	3995	A
huh i'll be	3995	A
yeah	3995	A
uh-huh	3995	A
my experience at camping is a little bit different um we do we do do a little family camping but i do a lot of elk hunting with uh bow and arrow elk and deer hunting	3995	A
and uh so i- i we go back into the mountains using horses and and uh go- and we'll pack in sometimes as far as ten miles	3995	A
back in just on horseback and we'll stay for ten days and	3995	A
and that's a lot of fun but it's it's not real uh conducive to taking my wife uh she doesn't appreciate being away from civilization that long and	3995	A
and uh no electricity and no you know we you you take a bath in the creek and freeze to death while you're doing it but uh	3995	A
uh it is but it is fun	3995	A
of course i guess it takes the right personality	3995	A
no no i've done that lots of times	3995	A
yeah it's in fact i as far as i'm concerned i don't get enough	3995	A
um but	3995	A
we'll probably go during the summertime on uh like a three-dayers probably two times and then as soon as fall comes on and the hunting season starts	3995	A
uh we usually get one big one and then one big one that'll last probably ten days and then one or two small ones for two or three days at a time	3995	A
yeah	3995	A
um-hum	3995	A
yeah	3995	A
um-hum	3995	A
yeah i agree it's it's always fun to go with somebody that knows how to cook over an open fire that's a little that's a little different than uh you know heat control at home and and uh uh you can have some lousy meals out there or you can have some great meals um	3995	A
um-hum	3995	A
um-hum um-hum	3995	A
well it makes a difference we're we're set up with uh camping cots and uh and uh uh self inflating mattresses and and and things like that and then and then it's not so it's still not like home but it's uh	3995	A
um-hum	3995	A
yes well yeah but they don't come on the big trips they're very small too i've got a a six a three and a about a one one and a half and	3995	A
so	3995	A
yeah and they they enjoy the day ones we'll run up in the mountains like uh when i get off work sometimes and we're not- we're not very far we're forty five minutes from some	3995	A
some real nice mountains here and we can go up there and build a fire and cook hot dogs and that's really not camping though that's kind of a picnic's what that is but	3995	A
but they enjoy that	3995	A
well we have gone to several places	3995	B
um there's a real nice area north of here close to the Oklahoma border	3995	B
no we take tents	3995	B
tents and sleeping bags	3995	B
is what we use	3995	B
yeah we do uh we haven't gone in a while because we have a three year old and we're waiting for her to get a little bit older but we have two older kids and we take them	3995	B
and uh it's fun	3995	B
i mean we're not avid campers	3995	B
but um	3995	B
i guess our the funnest camping trip we had was was when we went up north	3995	B
close to the Oklahoma border that's north to me um	3995	B
and we stayed for about three or four days and the weather was very nice that's one thing you have to consider down here because in the summer it gets so hot	3995	B
that you know nobody wants to do anything	3995	B
um	3995	B
oh uh one time we went to Arkansas	3995	B
and did some camping	3995	B
i'd almost forgotten about that that was about	3995	B
six years ago i guess	3995	B
well we didn't really have any just second <b_aside> what <e_aside>	3995	B
<b_aside> is it getting worse and worse <e_aside>	3995	B
<b_aside> okay <e_aside>	3995	B
um	3995	B
uh no we really didn't go up in the mountains	3995	B
well this was a uh it wasn't a KOA what was- <b_aside> Frazier what was that that we went to in Arkansas <e_aside>	3995	B
<b_aside> it was a park it was a state park <e_aside>	3995	B
yeah it was a state park	3995	B
um and they had trails you know that we could go on	3995	B
uh we were going to go on the river but the river was so high that year it'd been raining so much that they wouldn't let anybody get on the river	3995	B
yeah there were a lot of snakes around	3995	B
<b_aside> oh it was Snake River <e_aside>	3995	B
oh Snake River with a lot of snakes in it	3995	B
uh-huh	3995	B
oh wow	3995	B
oh wow	3995	B
yeah yeah	3995	B
yeah	3995	B
oh my gosh that's really roughing it	3995	B
uh-huh	3995	B
have you only done that once or you've done that several times	3995	B
you love doing that huh	3995	B
really oh wow	3995	B
um-hum um-hum	3995	B
um-hum	3995	B
um-hum <b_aside> TI switchboard <e_aside>	3995	B
well you've done a lot more camping than i have actually my husband's the one that's really the avid camper he you know has a lot more experienced and and he makes it a lot of fun for everybody though because he knows	3995	B
when you when you go with someone that's experienced and knows how to do things and it's a lot often fun for everybody else	3995	B
and	3995	B
oh yeah	3995	B
uh-huh yeah	3995	B
that's true when we were in Arkansas we'd been camping for about three days i guess and i was already tired of sleeping on the floor	3995	B
and we ran into a lady that told us about a resort area up there and we checked into one of these resorts and got to sleep in a	3995	B
a nice bed and that that was	3995	B
camping the right kind of camping to me	3995	B
yeah	3995	B
right makes a little bit more comfortable	3995	B
yeah do you have kids that you take along	3995	B
yeah	3995	B
oh wow you've really got your hands full	3995	B
yeah	3995	B
uh-huh	3995	B
oh that's great	3995	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3995	B
that's great	3995	B
that's great	3995	B
do you have any elderly relatives currently in uh in a nursing home now	3902	B
do you i have a grandmother she's a hundred and two	3902	B
she'll be a hundred and three in August	3902	B
and we decided not to put her in a nursing home	3902	B
she lives with my mother and my father who also live here in town and then my sister takes care of her	3902	B
she even though she is a hundred and two she still has all of her faculties	3902	B
she still has her snap she takes care of her own business this is the first year that she has gotten weak and actually has to have a little walker	3902	B
but with somebody that needs around the clock care i have seen my family age	3902	B
i've seen them in the she's been there ten years now and i have seen them age twenty in the time and and with the expense and everything i think- i still think it is worth it if you if you had a good nursing home	3902	B
and they needed some quality care i would put someone in a nursing home	3902	B
um-hum	3902	B
oh well that's good	3902	B
oh that is great	3902	B
why yeah i'm sure you have got some really good nursing homes around Dallas	3902	B
um-hum i- i- i know a lady that lives in a place similar to that in Austin	3902	B
where	3902	B
and the bad thing about it before you can get any kind of government help you just practically have we have to be a pauper	3902	B
it it takes every penny they want you to spend every dime you have before the government will pay for your your care and that's the sad part about it	3902	B
um-hum i think that's what most people do you just have to give it everything away	3902	B
i- i- i work at a brokerage firm and i have seen so many people that just have to gift	3902	B
you know their belongings as much as they can each year in anticipation of having to move to a nursing home	3902	B
i can't imagine i'm twenty nine and everybody in my family's always had we don't have any children everybody that has has them_1 later in life so my my mother and my father are in their late sixties	3902	B
so i mean they're not that far away	3902	B
oh i know	3902	B
it but yeah most people aren't	3902	B
and that's the bad thing i would hate to have lived so long she lived by herself	3902	B
my grandfather passed away before i was born so she lived by herself up until she was ninety ninety one	3902	B
and just did everything and it but most people aren't like-	3902	B
okay well why don't you start because_1 it said i was suppose to ask you what do you	3902	A
yes i do	3902	A
oh my gosh	3902	A
uh-huh	3902	A
uh-huh	3902	A
right	3902	A
right	3902	A
yeah	3902	A
right	3902	A
my mother-in-law finally they had to make a family decision there's seven children in my husband's family and fortunately four of them_1 live in the same home town	3902	A
and she has Alzheimer's it was getting where she was	3902	A
getting things- dangerous i mean letting strangers in and things like this but they were very fortunate it's a small town and	3902	A
she happens to room with one of the doctor's mother's and then she's got a lot of family there and that go and see her all of the time but she really doesn't nobody thought she would adjust but she's adjusted beautifully	3902	A
but then i am also facing my father who is very sick and my mother and father reside in Colorado she's been taking care of him i don't know how much longer this can last	3902	A
and at that point because_1 he requires round the clock he can't do anything without her he doesn't know when to take his medicine	3902	A
and it's really sad and i have thought if something would happen to my mother for	3902	A
uh my brother's are not interested in helping me so i would have to move him down here that way i want to see the nursing home if i have to put him into one	3902	A
you know where i can go see it i i'd be very uncomfortable with him being in Colorado	3902	A
and	3902	A
yes and some of them_1 are limited care too where people can do uh like they have apartment styles but that wouldn't work for him i think he's beyond that	3902	A
where if you need help you can get it but basically people kind of have a small apartment and doctor's are available if they need them and allows	3902	A
yeah	3902	A
yeah well the only problem with these are that they are very expensive of course i guess all nursing homes there is	3902	A
but	3902	A
right	3902	A
yeah	3902	A
right	3902	A
yeah i see- uh yeah and i think a lot of people who do it now in Colorado it's interesting i talked to my mother they allow you sixty five thousand dollars and your car and your home	3902	A
and my mother could make it on that what she probably would do is disburse the money to me and then i would send it back to her so that's probably what would happen	3902	A
yeah it's unfortunate	3902	A
right	3902	A
yeah it's frightening and i guess uh i don't know how old you are i'm forty six you know we're the generation moving into this and i don't know how our kids are gonna take care of us	3902	A
you know	3902	A
yeah	3902	A
yeah	3902	A
right -yeah	3902	A
i also fill in my generation a squeeze between	3902	A
looking to having to help my parents and still having to help my son because things are so rough out there job wise and he's still living at home and i don't know how he's ever going to get on his own the way things are	3902	A
and so it's kind of squeezed- you feel squeezed in the middle of having both generations but it something will have to change as more and more of us get older uh luckily if we could be like your grandmother	3902	A
i uh you know i would love to live to a hundred and two if i were okay	3902	A
but you see these people in their seventies yeah most aren't that's the problem	3902	A
that's incredible	3902	A
well Liz do you own a boat	3964	A
um-hum	3964	A
um where do you sail at	3964	A
how- how large is your boat	3964	A
um-hum	3964	A
that's too bad we've got- we've got a boat it isn't a sail boat my i should say my family does also	3964	A
it's a it's a fishing and ski boat it'll hold about seven people	3964	A
but we have a lot of fun uh every year we get together for a a week down on a place uh it's uh it's kind of a resort we have a time share down there and take the boat and	3964	A
water ski and and go fishing early in the mornings when the water's cold and	3964	A
it's a lot of fun and even the little kids uh enjoy it i've got	3964	A
uh a six year old and and of course some of the other family has some around eight or ten and we have a great big oh it'll hold about probably five or six kids that size it's a big	3964	A
kind of like a a a water weenie that floats in the water and they can all get on it at once	3964	A
and they just have a blast we put a a life jacket on everybody and then you know just pull them_1 around and	3964	A
uh we burn up a tank or two of gas a day	3964	A
and get a really good sunburn and just have a great time	3964	A
but my experience with boating and at at least that way i don't know the sailing might be different i i don't know i think i'd kind of be too impatient to uh	3964	A
to sail but uh i don't know it might be kind of fun too just to	3964	A
uh relax and i guess it's all wind powered isn't it when you sail	3964	A
um-hum	3964	A
um	3964	A
hm	3964	A
so that's additional speed when you're is that what you	3964	A
uh-huh	3964	A
yes	3964	A
um-hum	3964	A
i see and you always get to be the one that's hanging over the edge	3964	A
um-hum	3964	A
sure	3964	A
hm	3964	A
um-hum	3964	A
hm	3964	A
well do you just drop an anchor when you find a place or do you just kind of let it go and you do take an anchor then and	3964	A
um-hum	3964	A
uh oh	3964	A
cut the rope huh	3964	A
how how large is your boat how many how many people could go on it at once	3964	A
um-hum	3964	A
are are they set up so you can spend the night in them_1 and	3964	A
well my family has a has a sailboat and we haven't actually been out in- in it in a while um but we do	3964	B
there's a lake uh right at by our airport here in Dallas and uh Lake Grapevine	3964	B
and um actually i have not done much sailing i had uh	3964	B
i would i have crewed in it	3964	B
but i've never really gotten to where i feel comfortable you know doing the whole thing myself and had	3964	B
all kinds of plans to go out and take lessons and do it and uh	3964	B
for a while there we had flooded lakes and didn't have a chance to so i haven't done that yet	3964	B
i'm trying to remember uh probably uh	3964	B
i really can't remember	3964	B
uh it's a boat that my sister and i had told	3964	B
my father who's in his seventies we had said you know maybe	3964	B
uh it would be nice- maybe sometime we'd like to learn more about sailing and um he he who he is the one who loves sailing and he's the one who's been in it	3964	B
and he just went out and bought a boat uh we didn't mean it that seriously so he went out and bought one he is not fun to sail with it is always a crisis and so um	3964	B
he turned me off against it when i was young and then later different men- men that i have known have had boats and and they made it fun	3964	B
but um he doesn't	3964	B
uh-huh	3964	B
uh-huh	3964	B
oh i bet that's fun	3964	B
uh-huh	3964	B
oh	3964	B
oh how fun	3964	B
yeah	3964	B
yeah	3964	B
i bet	3964	B
i bet	3964	B
it is uh you you can have a motor on it and and a lot of them do i uh just because if you get out there and there's no wind it's pretty hard to get back	3964	B
i find it very relaxing i i think they're they're absolutely beautiful i you know i really as i say would like to learn to do it myself just got turned off early on by	3964	B
a particular manner but um it's a wonderful feeling my son and and and- can sail and he and i have gone out	3964	B
but he likes to cut it right right to the when you're going along with the wind you you you can get you can decide how much you want to heel and he loves to take it as far over as possible	3964	B
i find that	3964	B
yeah the closer to the wind you are	3964	B
then you've seen sailboats out where they're just way over	3964	B
and that's they're just moving right on out	3964	B
well you know i mean since he's doing the other there you know where am i supposed to go so that that is not my favorite but um a friend who um i dated um years back uh and and i would go out and that was just wonderful you'd	3964	B
you know take some take a picnic and and go out and you can go in little coves and and	3964	B
it's so quiet it's it that that's something i love i mean i i like ski boats too	3964	B
and the speed and you know going around but there's something extremely peaceful about a sail boat	3964	B
yeah	3964	B
yeah	3964	B
um really comfortably about four adults	3964	B
and uh	3964	B
well not this one but but some are there's so many-	3964	B
-okay	3961	A
well i have three they are all grown but i have three grandchildren that live very close by that i spend a lot of time with	3961	A
oh see oldest one's fourteen then the youngest one is six	3961	A
right	3961	A
um-hum	3961	A
right	3961	A
uh-huh	3961	A
oh yes	3961	A
yes	3961	A
yes they are in fact you know i pick them up from school their mother is also going to school she's in nurses' school and ought to be finished in May so that leaves me a lot of time with the grandchildren	3961	A
oh well like they are in dance class and things like that and i pick them_1 up from school and i take them_1 there um	3961	A
which it's all right for one of them_1 i think because_1 she enjoys it and seems to have a talent for it but the other one i wonder about i think she's just pushed into it	3961	A
to have something to do and uh are	3961	A
yes uh-huh well i- i can- can sympathize i know i	3961	A
i would go when mine were growing up uh from one extreme to the other you know either i we didn't do anything or we did too much it's it's hard to decide and uh	3961	A
decide when they're old enough to make their own decisions that uh you are i wanted them_1 to have the opportunities to do what they wanted but	3961	A
wasn't sure what that was	3961	A
well they may pick it up a little bit later and uh	3961	A
all that but uh i know my oldest one he is well he's an honor student and just	3961	A
wins all the awards at school but he's not really outside of school involved in anything other than the church activities so uh he's not a baseballer or anything like that but he seems very well adjusted and	3961	A
oh right yes that's that is good	3961	A
um-hum	3961	A
yeah i imagine-	3961	A
imagine it takes a while to settle down and let children settle in school and	3961	A
find out friends and what what it is they're wanting to do	3961	A
so	3961	A
oh yes uh-huh	3961	A
well yeah well it's	3961	A
well how many children do you have	3961	B
yeah	3961	B
well that's great	3961	B
that's good how old are your grandchildren	3961	B
well good my we have five children and our oldest one uh will turn uh fifteen next month and the youngest one uh will turn	3961	B
uh eight the end of April so they're about the same uh range as your grandchildren um-hum uh and so uh they're pretty busy right now we the oldest is in uh	3961	B
uh the ninth grade school here uh the second one is in uh junior high third one is in uh what they call it intermediate school fifth and sixth grades	3961	B
and the last two are in uh an elementary school and it looks like uh we're gonna have them_1 in at least four different schools for uh you know three more years so that keeps us busy running around some times	3961	B
are your are are yours in school near there your	3961	B
hum what kind of things have you done with the kids	3961	B
yeah well that's possible for now	3961	B
yeah i guess that trade off between uh	3961	B
you know letting them_1 just do the things they enjoy doing or pushing them_1 kind of just a little bit of a nudge so that they they uh	3961	B
you know get into something far enough that they do enjoy it by themselves you know is is a tension for most parents	3961	B
yeah right right	3961	B
that's right we	3961	B
um-hum	3961	B
yeah well we found out particularly with piano we wanted the kids to take piano for a few years you know and i said well you need to take it for	3961	B
for at least six so that you know whether you wanna do it any more you build up enough- enough skill that you can you make a a reasonable choice	3961	B
so we pushed for a few years but then uh then we moved and and dropped it i hope some get back into something- into something	3961	B
i hope so	3961	B
well	3961	B
um-hum	3961	B
most of our focus is either on some school activities or going to or our church activities and they uh we just moved here uh this summer and so we uh we're sort of getting into things uh they've got a	3961	B
good number of of activities and uh we enjoy you know transporting them_1 to that because we really hope there's gonna be some benefit from those things you know and uh	3961	B
so they're they're doing that we uh	3961	B
uh haven't gotten into too many civic activities where we were before they were playing soccer and uh	3961	B
did a little bit of gymnastics uh things like that uh here we haven't really gotten into it too much	3961	B
uh we may later on sometime if you know they show particular interest	3961	B
sure	3961	B
that's right yeah	3961	B
well i uh	3961	B
i don't know about the time we spend with them_1 it seems like we're with them_1 all the time if we're not here you know not working you know uh	3961	B
but um i'm sure they'd like more and it's hard for us it's hard to balance it you know there's some that	3961	B
sort of uh i don't know about_1 demand but you know sort of just take up more time just by their nature and uh we we struggle to uh i do any way not to work so much that i- i don't give them_1 time you know being with them_1 and stuff like that	3961	B
uh sometimes it'd be just nice to come to the office and and work straight through without you know uh spending time with them_1 but i like you know i like to spend time with them_1 and and be with the kids and all like that i	3961	B
uh	3961	B
do you take them_1 over say to see	3961	B
hi	3974	B
Bridgette i'm Jackie	3974	B

oh i'm from Wisconsin Kenosha yeah i'm not very familiar with Texas	3974	B
yeah i'm far	3974	B
yeah i- i live in Kenosha Wisconsin	3974	B
yeah i i've gotten a lot of people from Texas and they're always like wow Wisconsin	3974	B
uh-huh okay okay	3974	B
all right ah what kind of music do you like	3974	B
oh yeah is that really popular in Texas or is that just like a stereotype because_1 it's the south	3974	B
is it	3974	B
oh	3974	B
um well i used to not really like country that much but i think but what my dad really likes it	3974	B
and i used to listen to that and the older i got the more it you know i i can listen to it but um i prefer um um hm groups like i like um Firehouse	3974	B
and Slaughter and um Scorpions- um the Scorpions	3974	B
yeah yeah but i also like the top forty too and i really like the oldies station like um fifties music	3974	B
yeah and and um The Doors are pretty good too i can listen to them and The Who i- i really like all kinds i	3974	B
um no that's about the only kind i don't get into is like rap and like classical and um	3974	B
jazz is all right but um like the blues and stuff like that i- i like to dance and if it's like a upbeat you know good song then then i'll listen to it and if i'm out you know dancing then makes it better to listen to	3974	B
yeah um there's this station called The Blaze from Chicago and that's my favorite because_1 they yeah they play um all different kinds of um harder rock	3974	B
um-hum oh i've been there hm um-hum	3974	B
oh really	3974	B
no	3974	B
um-hum	3974	B
oh really uh oh yeah oh that's neat uh-huh me too yeah	3974	B
hm	3974	B
oh really we get a lot like at the bars because um we have a lot of like bands that form by themselves like from Milwaukee and Chicago trying to get started you know to the big top and yeah	3974	B
oh really uh-huh	3974	B
i think a lot of music has to do with like you know the type of people you hang around with and especially your environment like you know the settings like the bigger cities you get more variety i think you know	3974	B
oh yeah	3974	B
uh i've gotten to like um a couple of songs from Garth Brooks	3974	B
yeah i- i just um heard of him this year my boyfriend um he uh likes some types of country music and he was listening to that and it	3974	B
um-hum	3974	B
yeah	3974	B
yeah i i've liked most the songs i heard so that was good	3974	B
yeah same here	3974	B
oh yeah	3974	B
uh i just started um listening to it too because my boyfriend but yeah after i heard it a while at first i didn't like it and then i heard it and then i'm like oh this isn't so bad you know it's it's	3974	B
you know upbeat and	3974	B
you know i got into it and i saw on TV one time um they were playing Garth Brooks and they were um showing how to country dance to it and it looked so fun because_1 like i say i like to dance and it was just really neat	3974	B
yeah it it looked fun i'm like oh i wanna learn now	3974	B
oh yeah	3974	B
oh	3974	B
yeah	3974	B
i'm Bridgette	3974	A
it's nice to meet you	3974	A
i'm in Lubbock	3974	A
it's in west Texas	3974	A
oh really	3974	A
oh my gosh	3974	A
well is that where you are right now	3974	A
oh my gosh i didn't know i'd get someone that far away	3974	A
i know that's i was like oh my gosh so we're supposed to talk about music okay i'll push one then	3974	A
okay	3974	A
um i listen to all sorts of music really i think uh i like a lot of country	3974	A
um	3974	A
i think it's pretty popular i mean it is probably like a huge stereotype but i think it's pretty popular too what kind of music do you like	3974	A
uh-huh	3974	A
uh-huh	3974	A
uh-huh	3974	A
so you like more hard rock yeah	3974	A
uh-huh	3974	A
really	3974	A
uh-huh that's how i am too do you like any rap music	3974	A
yeah i don't either	3974	A
uh-huh	3974	A
so you like mostly like uh do you like hard rock the best	3974	A
really	3974	A
uh-huh well i'm from Dallas and uh	3974	A
have you they have hard rock stations there i don't even think they have a hard rock station in Lubbock i pretty sure they don't if they if they do i've never come across it	3974	A
but they only have i mean they don't have really it's really small and uh they don't have that really many radio you know like top forty stations even	3974	A
yeah it's more like a college town so yeah because_1 i'm in college	3974	A
cool so um i mean i don't think gah they had a i don't think they do have a hard rock station here	3974	A
see you don't here very often and you never have like bands come you never have them_1 like come up to we're up here you know	3974	A
oh really	3974	A
see that's great you would never see that here no i don't think you would	3974	A
yeah see yeah see i think most people listen to country up here being it's so far like in the panhandle of Texas and stuff	3974	A
do you i know he's great i like him a lot	3974	A
uh-huh	3974	A
see i only know very few too even i mean i only know like Garth Brooks and like George Straight and a few of the top the really good guys i like- uh Garth Brooks i really like him he's really good	3974	A
uh-huh	3974	A
you have to kind of get used to it though because_1 i didn't like country western really for a while and even when i came up here i didn't listen to it until like last year then i started listening to it a lot and then- then you like it a lot	3974	A
oh really	3974	A
uh-huh	3974	A
oh yeah you would like two stepping then	3974	A
i know i wanted to i wanna learn to because_1 we can do it but we're not very good	3974	A
we're just like oh yeah we kind of fake it you know so i wanna take lessons because_1 i think that'd be so fun i think	3974	A
have you snow- had any snow up your way	3936	B
um	3936	B
um	3936	B
well i talked to a woman who lived up in the hills uh mountains in uh Utah uh	3936	B
guess this last weekend and she had uh quite a bit of snow on the ground her way	3936	B
um	3936	B
yeah well the weather uh here is always a topic of conversation in Texas	3936	B
but uh	3936	B
we have wide variations and have	3936	B
warm weather when most people have cold weather but we have our share of cold weather as well the uh temperature this morning was right at freezing it didn't stay there but it was	3936	B
right at	3936	B
we usually have some of our coldest weather toward the uh	3936	B
end of January but this year it wasn't bad at all i guess that's because we had so much rain	3936	B
oh yeah	3936	B
well my uh	3936	B
my sister lives in Houston and they uh	3936	B
the river there was uh in the flooding stage near where her son lives and that uh	3936	B
caused some uh concern of course	3936	B
they have a uh lake cabin and uh their dock was completely under water on the lake	3936	B
so we really had a lot of rain	3936	B
right	3936	B
yeah we had a lot of flash floods in the area we had a few people who ran into uh	3936	B
water and a few fatalities just uh just uh a few not more than ten	3936	B
but	3936	B
well the uh	3936	B
there's an old profane	3936	B
expression about Texas weather it's always too damn cold too damn hot too damn windy	3936	B
well El Paso won't be cold	3936	B
no it's it's quite southern and it's it's rare to get real cold in in El Paso	3936	B
the uh	3936	B
you'll be flying in there	3936	B
well uh take off is uh fun from El Paso because you normally the way the winds are you take off right toward the mountain the Rockies	3936	B
and they're towering above you and so you circle back over the air and then make a circle around and come back over again	3936	B
well	3936	B
well i noticed on the weather map on uh cable network that	3936	B
there was supposed to be a storm front moving into California and on down your way but i guess it didn't pan out huh	3936	B
hm	3936	B
oh boy	3936	B
um-hum	3936	B
huh	3936	B
well we uh had a bad siege last uh Christmas a year ago we went up to visit my wife's uh	3936	B
sister who lives in uh Calgary Alberta Canada-	3936	B
no we haven't had any since uh oh just before Christmas	3936	A
and uh we got a lot before Christmas the ski resorts were really excited and uh but now uh	3936	A
we have we've had fog for about forty days in a row and temperature inversion so but no uh no snow	3936	A
the snow's all melted off the mountains uh	3936	A
uh-huh	3936	A
i guess there there's different parts of the state of Utah that that that does have some but uh not usually we have up to a hundred and fifty inches up at the ski resorts and they're down between thirty eight and uh	3936	A
forty inches	3936	A
this time of the year and uh we've been in a drought for the last five years this is the sixth year	3936	A
and it's getting quite serious as far as water next summer	3936	A
right	3936	A
oh well that's that's different isn't it	3936	A
um	3936	A
i know my son was telling me about the rain down there he said yeah well it just and we read in the newspaper southern part of Texas i guess-	3936	A
flooded out	3936	A
oh wow	3936	A
yeah my son in Plano he lives fairly close to there's quite a wash that goes down uh through Plano	3936	A
and uh there's walking trails on both sides a walking path and uh when i've gone down to visit him i've gone on that but uh that was clear full and up to up to some of the streets i guess it just gets-	3936	A
um-hum	3936	A
that's funny that uh we can't have it in moderation instead of having either a drought or having too much	3936	A
seems like-	3936	A
yeah well it's uh interesting uh i'm going down to El Paso next week	3936	A
and uh i was wondering what the weather was but i imagine that if it's that cold in Dallas it	3936	A
it's not a doesn't get that cold i guess huh	3936	A
yes	3936	A
uh-huh	3936	A
yes	3936	A
right	3936	A
yeah we're kind of used to that here in Utah of course there are mountains and i fly into Montana a lot and we have a	3936	A
the mountains are are really uh high and a lot of places we go into you just kind of uh it's in the little valley but	3936	A
and i uh sure hope we we really need the moisture i hope we can get uh get some there's supposed to be a storm but it split went down through uh northern Arizona and southern Utah and	3936	A
they're not predicting any for the next uh week anyway up here so	3936	A
yeah well that's that's what the went above uh	3936	A
some of it went to the south and some to the north up into Montana so that just left us we got a high pressure	3936	A
system that's just been sitting in here and uh we broke the record for the amount of fog that we've had uh you know airport's been shut down uh till about noon everyday and they they seed the clouds or seed the fog to try to	3936	A
to get the airplanes in and out	3936	A
um-hum	3936	A
and	3901	A
have you lived in Garland long	3901	A
about six years- tell me your name again i'm sorry Carol okay um are you in a new area or old	3901	A
yeah yeah	3901	A
oh really	3901	A
oh no leakage or	3901	A
oh not	3901	A
i'm not sure what to do	3901	A
well our house is about um twelve years old i guess we've been in it for about two years and	3901	A
i guess there's advantages- advantages and disadvantages to moving into a new or old house um	3901	A
one thing it had all of the window treatments you know so we didn't have to redo that and it had been updated but	3901	A
their roof is old was old so uh last year we covered the wood shingles with uh that composition	3901	A
and that was- cost a fortune and uh	3901	A
now we're we're in the process of uh repainting the interior because we didn't paint when we first moved in	3901	A
you know that it's not as great well there's just a lot of uh i mean it has-	3901	A
that well the family before us raised three kids and a dog and cats and and so there's just wear wear and tear on the house but you don't notice	3901	A
until you live in it and have to clean it and you know you you find scratch marks on the wood or	3901	A
you know places were the dog chewed or i don't know things like that	3901	A
i would say uh you know that uh	3901	A
who is it the inspector you know that you use just um they have a list of things they go over but	3901	A
you know i think we had maybe a list on top of that that some friends had- of ours had told us to go through	3901	A
and just things that they might not normally look for and and go around with them and even if you're kind of on their you know looking over their shoulder or whatever um	3901	A
because there's lots of things that furniture hides and you know we have a place we have picture frame paneling in our living room and	3901	A
it is in beautiful condition it's uh it's a custom home but there's just areas that they skimped on and uh but the	3901	A
the uh picture frame paneling for the most part is beautiful and and they had this big arrangement on the mantel	3901	A
and it and i think one thing about the house that made us fall in love with it was	3901	A
because_1 we're um you know we haven't been married we've been married for almost four years and	3901	A
uh anyway	3901	A
but there's a piece of paneling behind that's above the mantel that has	3901	A
um it's right above the fireplace and i think they there must have been some water running down the chimney behind there because_1 there is some water damage and it's warped and with it being picture frame i don't know how to	3901	A
how to replace that one piece without having to tear it all down because it's one of the inset pieces so there's a lot of things to you know to look for and um	3901	A
but i guess new homes are like that to they probably have things that are constantly	3901	A
needing fixed or at least you probably have to i don't know did did you- all did the builder provide the mini blinds and stuff like that or did you- all yeah you had to go purchase all that	3901	A
what size- what size home are you in now	3901	A
uh-huh	3901	A
i'm not really familiar with the homes in Garland i guess i know	3901	A
um i tried	3901	A
um yeah we're going about six years yeah	3901	B
Carol um-hum	3901	B
um well it's about six years old we've lived here as long as the house has been built so i guess it is	3901	B
no that's exaggeration but we had some problems yesterday so	3901	B
um some plumbing problems	3901	B
so and it damaged the carpet and we're going to have to do something we're not sure call insurance or something so	3901	B
uh-huh	3901	B
right	3901	B
uh-huh	3901	B
uh-huh	3901	B
oh yeah	3901	B
yeah	3901	B
uh i wouldn't think about the painting	3901	B
uh-huh	3901	B
yeah	3901	B
yeah	3901	B
yeah	3901	B
yeah	3901	B
yeah	3901	B
yeah because_1 we're kind of thinking of uh trying to find a used home and uh the ones we've looked at have been really nice	3901	B
um but you know there's some things you don't really think about looking at in a pre owned home that that you do in a new home so	3901	B
uh-huh	3901	B
um-hum	3901	B
um-hum	3901	B
um-hum	3901	B
oh really	3901	B
yeah	3901	B
yeah	3901	B
uh-huh	3901	B
yeah	3901	B
yeah	3901	B
uh-huh	3901	B
uh-huh	3901	B
uh yeah	3901	B
yeah	3901	B
yeah	3901	B
yeah	3901	B
oh no no huh-uh yeah yeah from scratch everything but we're trying to look for a bigger home right now and and	3901	B
right now we're in um seventeen hundred square feet so it's were looking for something a lot bigger because we have two kids	3901	B
and uh but i like Garland i love Garland i really- really want to stay in Garland if i can but	3901	B
uh you know there's there's other places too like Sachse and that and that area- place- area out there which is really nice i've been to some friend's house out there and there's just uh there there's some really nice homes out there	3901	B
uh go ahead	3924	A
AIDS research is something that that i think that- whether our country is putting enough money into it and actually i'm concerned that they're not	3924	A
i have a friend who is working with uh who works with uh travel groups and one of the ones that he's worked- worked with was professionals who came in for an AIDS uh conference in uh California	3924	A
and these were from other people from other countries he's a translator	3924	A
and in talking to the people from France he said you know he says one of the things that really concerns me is your government's not telling you enough about how pervasive and frightening this epidemic is	3924	A
and they're letting the information out slowly about how	3924	A
you know how big it is which is scary you know it's pretty scary when so many people get it so i guess i'm i'm i'd like to see us spend more i don't know that spending more always gets it	3924	A
you mean more money for that means less for cancer or yeah- yeah	3924	A
um-hum um-hum	3924	A
well it i i agree with you there because i know every time that it- it- something comes into vogue all the money goes to that one and you don't know whether it's still also going to the other or if it's a limited pie	3924	A
money from	3924	A
money for taking care of the infants takes money away from taking care of the elderly or do they both get served uh that's a good point	3924	A
um-hum	3924	A
um-hum	3924	A
well and one of the things i'd and i'm with you that i don't know is is that really the only way it's being transmitted or was that the easier way to tell us and we're going to find out more	3924	A
uh that's that's the part that	3924	A
that's the part that scares me you know i mean beginning with this is this is just for homosexuals well no it's for homosexuals and gays well no actually it's i mean you know did they know that all along	3924	A
oh	3924	A
right	3924	A
and how is it really transmitted et cetera which is i think what they also don't know	3924	A
i mean that's i think they they told us what was convenient and felt safe to say you know it was nice to isolate it to one particular community that they have trouble	3924	A
you know they just as soon not approve of anyway but but that isn't how it was in Africa	3924	A
in Africa was the men and women and and had nothing to do with that and it's huge over there so i i you know and it's beginning to other countries that's was his point this was an international conference	3924	A
where people are saying well but in my country it's you know like this and does that mean like flus	3924	A
i mean i don't know	3924	A
all i'm saying is i think it's scarier than we know uh or maybe they understand but	3924	A
yeah and uh and then the people that have it it does seem that there are are some drugs that are there that you know they keep holding back if you if i were dying i'm not sure i would care	3924	A
yeah- exactly	3924	A
yeah yeah and that's i think what they're saying too	3924	A
-okay	3924	B
what are we supposed to discuss again	3924	B
more money less	3924	B
um-hum	3924	B
um-hum	3924	B
uh-huh	3924	B
hm	3924	B
yeah	3924	B
i'm i'm ambivalent about it because um	3924	B
uh	3924	B
it uh well it is very frightening and scary i have no perspective on how it relates to other diseases	3924	B
and uh i mean whether	3924	B
yes	3924	B
and uh whether those diseases can you- some difference could be made if you did pour more money in like diabetes research uh didn't uh	3924	B
you know but	3924	B
i uh then part of it's lack of education i don't know whether whether you know where our money would be most effectively spent	3924	B
um-hum	3924	B
and i'm i am concerned a lot about uh	3924	B
i'm concerned about uh	3924	B
two things one is preventing the spread and the other is for uh for uh treating the illness	3924	B
and i'm not certain i i again this i'm telling you basically i don't have any opinion but whether or not it would be uh our money would be better spent uh	3924	B
teaching you know working on the drug problems and the and the sex problems uh rather than trying to cure the people that already have it	3924	B
yeah well you know the dentist- whether my dentist or	3924	B
and and i heard something the other day this sounds ridiculous about mosquitoes	3924	B
and you know they've been saying oh no absolutely not can't get it from mosquitoes and uh and now they're saying well maybe in the right conditions yes	3924	B
and i don't know that's true or not i mean i just heard it in passing but	3924	B
so what does that what does that mean for people that you work with and shake hands with and	3924	B
yeah	3924	B
um-hum	3924	B
no	3924	B
um-hum	3924	B
oh	3924	B
i think maybe more information should be given out about it	3924	B
i i give me cyanide i mean is it uh-huh	3924	B
right-	3924	B
exactly and why can't you why can't the FDA say you know if- if these people knowingly consent to be research monkeys and well let them_1 let them_1 do it	3924	B
so what do you think	3950	B
um-hum	3950	B
yes	3950	B
uh-huh	3950	B
yeah	3950	B
right that's true i mean i'm twenty six now and i came through high school with about the first generation that had computers in the classroom	3950	B
and all that and it certainly has been good for me	3950	B
so i see myself	3950	B
you know when i learn a new system a new program or a new computer language that it's much easier for me than for let's say	3950	B
my colleagues who are a lot older but just as intelligent and whatever	3950	B
uh-huh	3950	B
that's true	3950	B
uh-huh	3950	B
and what do you think that's just a question of becoming more aware or has it become less safe over the years	3950	B
yeah i would agree with you	3950	B
um that's right	3950	B
uh-huh	3950	B
yeah i don't know i think a lot of what causes it is just economics	3950	B
naturally	3950	B
uh-huh	3950	B
uh-huh	3950	B
yeah i suppose it has uh	3950	B
that's right uh it's	3950	B
well let's see i think that the mass communication that we have in the world now is in general a good thing and i think it has its good points and	3950	B
bad points but in general it's pretty positive	3950	B
uh more or less yes i mean it is we have the	3950	B
global village you know like Maclean was saying but it doesn't	3950	B
i don't think that it really means that we have a sense of community yet as a world	3950	B
which	3950	B
which hopefully maybe coming we'll have to see	3950	B
uh-huh	3950	B
right	3950	B
well yeah that's definitely right i mean and when we're	3950	B
right well with things like the war in Iraq we were	3950	B
dealing with other people's affairs for our own interests certainly is what i believe	3950	B
um	3950	B
uh-huh	3950	B
um-hum	3950	B
yeah	3950	B
um	3950	B
i figured you were going to ask me first here i was going to ask you first this is a difficult one i mean unfortunately the first thoughts are sort of negative	3950	A
but then when i give myself a chance to think about it a little bit more i recognize the positives as well uh	3950	A
positives for sure are technology and	3950	A
um some of the changes that the computer age has brought i think that kids growing up today are just	3950	A
uh very much more facile than i was as a kid in terms of the use of computer technology and you know	3950	A
uh-huh	3950	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3950	A
yes	3950	A
um-hum and the earlier you learn	3950	A
yes the younger you are probably the easier it is	3950	A
um	3950	A
some of that i think probably we take for granted you know the changes have happened so rapidly that it's it's easy for us to forget how quickly it has changed	3950	A
i think probably the other thing i that came to mind is is the increased awareness on our part of the the criminal element if i can put it that way you know you you don't	3950	A
you don't uh casually let kids play in the street or you know ride their bike to friends if you're in an area where you're at all concerned about	3950	A
abduction	3950	A
i think it's changed i think that in the last twenty or thirty years there's definitely been an increase in that type of crime	3950	A
and i'm not sure why you know uh certainly a question that we could spend hours on you know whether whether there is a change in	3950	A
in the way a lot of individuals grow up whether or not there is you know more mental illness or something that causes that sort of	3950	A
thing to go on uh i don't know	3950	A
but you know kidnapping is a strange thing you know what kids today are not nearly as free as i was when i was a kid in terms of just being able to go to the store by myself or riding my bike around the neighborhood or	3950	A
being being informed at a very young age about uh going to a shopping center and what to do if a stranger approaches you i mean i never had a concept of that as a kid so that's certainly changed a lot in the last ten or twenty years	3950	A
anyway what are some positives that you could you've thought about besides spending too much time on the criminal element	3950	A
huh	3950	A
uh-huh	3950	A
it really does bring us together as a global community doesn't it	3950	A
um	3950	A
um-hum	3950	A
uh that's a good point	3950	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3950	A
i think that's something that uh is a political influence as well you know probably people feel it on a personal level more than they might	3950	A
um on a on a global level you know just being informed about what other countries and	3950	A
other cultures are doing	3950	A
in a way that we might have not been informed before but yet politically uh their activities aren't aren't	3950	A
influencing how our leaders direct	3950	A
legislation as as much as they could	3950	A
it's still really focused on our interests you know what i mean	3950	A
uh-huh	3950	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3950	A
yeah	3950	A
McDonald's uh	3950	A
burning up the uh	3950	A
the rain forests in order to have more cattle grazing so that somehow that's something that's not going to work out in the long term in that kind of a cycle it's going to catch up to us at some point	3950	A
what else has changed social changes uh i think that there's probably a greater awareness sensitivity on the part of men and women to to what the other	3950	A
um is adjusting to in life	3950	A
no but we're getting pretty close to it my wife's uh uh stepfather uh is in the hospital right now and hopefully we can pull him out uh back home but we don't know yet	3987	B
how about_1 yourself	3987	B
uh-huh	3987	B
uh-huh	3987	B
yeah so so is uh so is our uh my my uh my mother's parents	3987	B
my family my mother- mother and daddy are dead	3987	B
um-hum eighty four and eighty	3987	B
yeah see eighty four one eighty four year old man that's in the hospital	3987	B
but uh we've been looking into it and uh course nursing homes i think uh you would find that uh you would want uh one close to home	3987	B
and one that has a pleasant surrounding	3987	B
and one that has good staff that uh you know will take care of you and treat you you know like a a like an individual	3987	B
and uh	3987	B
and look after your every needs i know down here in Texas we've had a lot of problems with nursing homes that uh that don't uh take care of their people	3987	B
they've gone in they've closed down a lot of them_1 and they put new regulations on some of them_1	3987	B
you go in you find an old person with a bed sore because they haven't been turned or haven't been cleaned	3987	B
so uh all of that uh you know i think someone needs to know uh about uh the qualifications of a nursing home	3987	B
and the staff	3987	B
well let's assume that uh you wanted to take your mother to a uh nursing home there locally in Ogden i'm sure you've got some that's close by	3987	B
it would- it- what would be real nice is find one around the corner that you could visit that you could go in and uh talk to the people talk to some of the people's uh uh siblings	3987	B
or uh you know children children and uh find out how they like it you know course one of the most important things is is uh can you afford it	3987	B
and uh down in some small cities here in Texas it's about fifteen hundred dollars a month over here in Dallas it's closer to three thousand if you really wanna get super care you know you can pay anything you want to	3987	B
course we haven't even mentioned Medicaid uh which and uh which uh would take care of an individual who is destitute	3987	B
and course there's a lot to be said about uh making a member destitute	3987	B
as opposed to uh paying for it yourself because the government you know uh provides for a destitute person	3987	B
yeah	3987	B
yeah	3987	B
well yeah and that's true because uh after the year's gone all of her savings are going to be eaten up and if she owns her house uh	3987	B
i'm not sure about the total rules on the house but i assume that you'd have to sell the house and those proceeds would go to pay for the nursing home	3987	B
and anyway it's while it's unlawful	3987	B
um	3987	B
there's nothing wrong with a parent gifting everything she has to uh to	3987	B
uh to an individual like uh like like you	3987	B
and then uh from there on out uh saving that money uh so that uh you could supplement her income after she goes under Medicaid	3987	B
a lot of people do that	3987	B
and most one of the most important things uh about sending a person to uh the nursing home is is the burial provided for	3987	B
see that should be provided for before she ever goes out of her monies or otherwise you know the the uh the uh the kids have to provide that	3987	B
so uh you know- i sure you've thought of all this	3987	B
oh yes it's very sad we had a discussion with her mother who is uh is eighty years old this past weekend and uh	3987	B
okay um have you ever had to put one a a family member in a nursing home	3987	A
oh	3987	A
uh-huh	3987	A
oh	3987	A
well my mom is sixty five and she's which i feel is you know quite young still but she's not in the greatest of health and	3987	A
so recently she has been talking a lot about what we would do if we had to put her in a nursing home	3987	A
she's adamant that she does not want to live with any of her children	3987	A
and put that burden on us	3987	A
oh uh-huh	3987	A
uh-huh but their parents are still alive oh my goodness wow oh	3987	A
uh-huh	3987	A
right	3987	A
um-hum	3987	A
right	3987	A
um-hum	3987	A
oh	3987	A
oh oh dear	3987	A
um-hum	3987	A
now how do you go about finding out things like that you-	3987	A
uh-huh	3987	A
right	3987	A
um-hum	3987	A
oh that's right	3987	A
uh-huh	3987	A
well that's true	3987	A
that's right	3987	A
oh my	3987	A
boy	3987	A
well	3987	A
um-hum	3987	A
uh-huh	3987	A
oh well	3987	A
um-hum	3987	A
well that's what my mom's been saying you know she's been just saving her money and not paying a penny of it	3987	A
but she says my little bit of savings will probably pay for a nursing home for maybe a year and then i'll be on Medicaid anyway so she said	3987	A
why don't i go out and and enjoy life while i can	3987	A
and you know when i get to that point of being in a nursing home then maybe Medicaid will just have to take care of me but why don't i just enjoy life now	3987	A
i think so	3987	A
yes	3987	A
uh-huh	3987	A
uh-huh	3987	A
oh	3987	A
oh	3987	A
uh-huh	3987	A
that's right	3987	A
uh-huh	3987	A
yeah well it's	3987	A
it's kind of a sad thing to think about isn't it	3987	A
yeah	3987	A
hm	3987	A
um i	3915	B
mysteries- mysteries murder mysteries true murder mysteries	3915	B
and uh tacky romances	3915	B
what do you what have you read lately	3915	B
oh i got that The Cradle- uh	3915	B
The Cradle will Fall and	3915	B
is that the right who's is that one	3915	B
i've read i've read a few of hers i was just thinking i i just read a trilogy of Mary Higgins Clark	3915	B
and uh that's so that's why i got confused but	3915	B
and	3915	B
i've read all of his	3915	B
i can't oh it's been so long since i've read them_1 but i will buy those in hardback	3915	B
and uh	3915	B
no is it a good book	3915	B
where did you get it	3915	B
uh-huh	3915	B
uh-huh	3915	B
so well i loved Steel Magnolias i heard it was similar to that	3915	B
yeah that's one of my favorites	3915	B
uh-huh	3915	B
um-hum	3915	B
yeah	3915	B
i might go get it because_1 i i'm reading Newsweek right now and i'm going to be finished in a minute and and Bookstop stays open till eleven	3915	B
oh i i don't do that i read those i read pretty quickly	3915	B
um-hum	3915	B
that could be difficult but uh	3915	B
i read uh Prince of Tides i haven't seen that movie yet	3915	B
yes it was	3915	B
well i'll bring it next meeting	3915	B
because_1 i don't have- i don't have anything to do with them_1 when i finish with them_1 you can't sell them_1 for anything	3915	B
okay	3915	B
i read some self help books but	3915	B
i think- i like- i like to spend my time reading for enjoyment	3915	B
and uh	3915	B
at work yeah	3915	B
i have Neil by my bed	3915	B
i don't have i've got three dogs	3915	B
no	3915	B
well- well yeah i do i do	3915	B
they're in the front yard	3915	B
um-hum	3915	B
hey Cissy	3915	A
what kind of books do you enjoy	3915	A
uh-huh	3915	A
uh-huh sounds like we like the same kind	3915	A
well see i read the uh oh Helen McImes i read a trilogy of hers	3915	A
yeah	3915	A
a set- a group of three in one book	3915	A
uh she's the one that writes uh	3915	A
uh they're real good she's been writing for a long time and i was trying to remember she wrote one- uh she writes they've always have gone the spy um	3915	A
uh thing with them_1 you know setting in in foreign places or and they're they always have kind of a twist to them_1	3915	A
oh yeah um-hum	3915	A
yeah those are good too	3915	A
uh-huh	3915	A
and then i got uh	3915	A
some of Robert Ludlum's i like those too do you like him	3915	A
yeah i get the Supreme- Bourne Supreme the Bourne ones i get them all mixed up	3915	A
yeah i have a lot of those in hardback too	3915	A
uh and did you read Fried Green Tomatoes	3915	A
oh it's wonderful	3915	A
well my daughter gave it to me uh quite a while ago to read	3915	A
and uh then uh uh i guess what brought it to mind uh was that uh last time i went to see the movie	3915	A
and uh it did not disappoint me and it's it's just so well written of course Fanny Flag wrote it	3915	A
and uh it's uh it's got humor in it and a little bit of suspense- suspense	3915	A
and uh uh and you'll cry	3915	A
well i think i didn't read Steel Magnolias but i think it's probably better than Steel Magnolias were	3915	A
the movie is anyway and Steel Magnolias was tremendous	3915	A
but uh this one it just uh sort of has a well my husband enjoyed it i i just kind of mixed- you know mixed feelings i didn't know whether he would- it might be a woman's movie	3915	A
but uh he just he just raved about the actresses in it that they were so good and everything was real and	3915	A
it was just really good and the reason my daughter gave it to me is because my mother is in a nursing home	3915	A
but uh it was good	3915	A
um-hum	3915	A
um-hum well i would highly recommended it and don't get discouraged in the first few chapters	3915	A
because-	3915	A
well you may have to go- i do to and i had to go back and reread	3915	A
because you have to get the they're telling two stories at once	3915	A
and you have to get it straight and get the names straight	3915	A
that's the thing get all the names straight	3915	A
uh-huh where you you're working with two stories and once you get that down it flows and you can't wait to get to the next part	3915	A
it uh it's one of those that you get caught up in	3915	A
oh	3915	A
i haven't read that book was it good	3915	A
okay_1 i'll have to see if i can get it	3915	A
oh all right wonderful wonderful	3915	A
no you can't i'd love to borrow it from you	3915	A
all right um	3915	A
we're all supposed to say what do we read for improvement what have you read for improvement	3915	A
um-hum	3915	A
i do too	3915	A
well if- if you're like me there're so many technical things to read	3915	A
that when i read at home	3915	A
yeah i just don't want to	3915	A
to well of course i i garden a lot and i read a lot of gardening things	3915	A
but uh	3915	A
oh yes Neil and then the American Gardening Society puts out a real good book on on vegetables	3915	A
um-hum you don't need vegetables	3915	A
you have problems even with flowers	3915	A
yeah	3915	A
um-hum	3915	A
yeah it's a good place for them_1 if the dogs	3915	A
well i feel like the major problem we have and the reason that crime has gotten so out of hand is because there isn't a punishment that's matching what's being done	3957	B
and i think it starts when the kids are little i think the parents in our community teach our children that as long as they can get away with something that it's all right	3957	B
because i don't see a lot of parents especially where i'm at i have a lot of the responsibility of what ever is done in our neighborhood because there's no other mothers at home	3957	B
and i see a lot of kids very small kids coming home to empty homes every day and doing all kinds of unbelievable things and as long as they don't let anybody know about it they get away with it so	3957	B
you know i feel like if our parents- mothers stayed home if we had that secure start you know where kids learned the right way to act um they were rewarded for their good behavior	3957	B
and they had a secure family that they came from i think we'd see a whole different society	3957	B
that's right	3957	B
yeah	3957	B
right	3957	B
well you know i did a survey on why mothers left their children to go to work and i found out that more than eighty percent of all the people i talked to	3957	B
the mothers went to work to provide a better life for their children and when i talked with their children their children wanted their parents home rather than the the material things they were getting	3957	B
and it's just too bad that the parents won't listen to this survey	3957	B
so i just think that um another problem is i think the way the legal system has been set up that the criminals get out and the jails are so over crowded they can't handle punishing this the	3957	B
people that are committing the bad crimes	3957	B
sufficiently i think they need to put more people out to death um if it's completely witnessed and it's uh seen that there's no	3957	B
you know i think there needs to be more severe punishment but it needs to be fair	3957	B
right i think that	3957	B
to oh out do it	3957	B
yeah or out do what's been done	3957	B
yeah i think that's another problem um i know that once when i was reading a book when i was studying history	3957	B
and it said you show me a country that can produce strong families and you'll have a strong country	3957	B
and if you look back over United States histories our country was strong until the mothers started leaving the home	3957	B
that's right	3957	B
that's right and they do and then they grow up and it just continually will get worse	3957	B
so	3957	B
i guess what we both agree on is that families need to change their way of thinking	3957	B
right and i think people need to have some sort of a an idea of why we're here and what we're doing and what we're working towards and why it's important to do these things rather than just getting ahead materialistically	3957	B
that's right well um do they come- do they come on and say when we've talked- visited for five minutes	3957	B
this is your first time	3957	B
um	3957	B
we discussed i discussed on here with someone um last week about the justice system and how it could be improved on juries and we discussed about how half the jury that they select to	3957	B
you know come up with the verdict if half of those were law students then they could understand what was going on in the court room	3957	B
and have the time that they spent in their jury district count towards some of their graduation hours	3957	B
wouldn't that be a good idea because_1 i think so sometimes the juries don't understand all this the legal you know talk and and what's going on	3957	B
and this way it would get people that were a little more knowledgeable at least half of them_1	3957	B
to be on that board or on the jury	3957	B
-okay how do you feel about it	3957	A
i agree with that	3957	A
um-hum	3957	A
yes i have the same thing here	3957	A
yeah that kind of goes right along with what i'm thinking too is well the movies and the TV the violence and all the	3957	A
things that are on there if the parents were home in the afternoon when the children came home maybe they wouldn't be watching as much as this	3957	A
but then again there's some of them_1 at home at night with them_1 that do not monitor what their children are watching	3957	A
and so it's i think you're right in that it is parents caring enough to may be put off having that other car or the other TV or what ever it is they're working for	3957	A
and take care of the children	3957	A
um-hum what'd you find out	3957	A
yes i- i can believe that	3957	A
um-hum	3957	A
um-hum	3957	A
right	3957	A
right but and maybe not quite so much publicity either i think there's far too much publicity on some of these violent crimes that and then it seems to become a challenge	3957	A
to be shown to people to see if they can get away with it	3957	A
right that it's	3957	A
um-hum women's rights and all these good things the children are the ones who suffer	3957	A
yes and and	3957	A
right- right yes and until the families change i think that we'll continue to have this problem and it will worsen	3957	A
yes uh-huh uh back to the old basic morals and	3957	A
i- i don't know i- i thought they did but this is my first time also so well but in	3957	A
um-hum	3957	A
hey that would be a good idea that's	3957	A
yeah	3957	A
that	3957	A
what kind of music do you like	3939	B
oh now that i don't know	3939	B
either that or i didn't listen to Sons of the Pioneers i've heard about	3939	B
uh	3939	B
in fact i have a friend who uh plays hammered dulcimer and sings uh yodel cowboy yodeling songs and she talked-	3939	B
talks about	3939	B
Patsy Montana	3939	B
i think you know who that was	3939	B
no	3939	B
well that she she	3939	B
that was	3939	B
i gather an old	3939	B
cowgirl who used to	3939	B
sing songs like that	3939	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3939	B
pretty much like like rock	3939	B
or or	3939	B
or just too similar to each other	3939	B
yeah yeah	3939	B
well i like all of that i like classical i when i look at my tapes it's hard to tell i like Celtic music i like classical	3939	B
i like uh some of the new age music	3939	B
i like uh blues uh	3939	B
Muddy Waters people like that i like uh	3939	B
uh	3939	B
what else do i have-	3939	B
folk music	3939	B
i like folk music a lot	3939	B
uh oh you mean uh flamenco oh yes that's beautiful	3939	B
yeah flamenco's beautiful	3939	B
yeah yeah	3939	B
well that that i like and i used to live in Mexico so i like i like Mexican music to a certain extent just because- because it reminds me of that time	3939	B
and then uh um	3939	B
do you play anything	3939	B
you mean yours and everyone else's	3939	B
uh-huh	3939	B
uh-huh	3939	B
wow	3939	B
uh-huh	3939	B
and do you do it do you play	3939	B
yeah	3939	B
well i	3939	B
and get back- and get back into trying something with music huh	3939	B
oh you do	3939	B
oh well that's great	3939	B
yeah	3939	B
no well i played the piano you know as a child uh	3939	B
for years and then quit and then kind of enjoyed it and took the guitar and	3939	B
played the guitar a little bit and i can sight read uh and we have a	3939	B
piano my son was a percussionist and so he has we have a marimba and a drum set if i were to take anything i think i would take drums i just loved it when he did that	3939	B
in- in fact one time uh i bought a a two hour session with his teacher for a	3939	B
lady who said she would had always wanted to go and just play all of those percussion instruments that you see including the gong the big big gong	3939	B
and so he let us into the percussion room and we got to play on every single instrument	3939	B
what	3939	B
uh-huh	3939	B
uh-huh	3939	B
uh-huh	3939	B
well i i like uh i guess it would be easier to say tell you what kind i don't like i don't like hard rock	3939	A
uh	3939	A
but other than that i i like just about every kind i	3939	A
i'm not real crazy about modern uh country and western i i like the old uh	3939	A
uh country western songs that i grew up with uh	3939	A
San Antonio Rose	3939	A
and uh the Sons of the Pioneers Cool Water and that sort of thing	3939	A
well see you're not as old as i am	3939	A
yeah	3939	A
um-hum	3939	A
no	3939	A
um-hum	3939	A
yeah and i i like the old Hank Williams songs	3939	A
but uh the modern kind it seems to me it all sounds just pretty much alike	3939	A
um yeah well	3939	A
it's hard to tell one song from- yeah it's hard to tell one song from the other	3939	A
too- too be truthful with you i'm sort of a Beethoven and Bach fan	3939	A
um-hum	3939	A
um-hum	3939	A
um-hum	3939	A
um-hum	3939	A
yeah i have a good friend who grew up in Mexico she's been in this country oh about twelve fifteen years	3939	A
and uh uh	3939	A
she gave me a tape uh of some Spanish music	3939	A
oh what is that dance	3939	A
with the ladies in the long dress and the fans	3939	A
yeah flamenco	3939	A
it's modern day flamenco music	3939	A
yeah and it's really different and it's really pretty	3939	A
um-hum	3939	A
um-hum	3939	A
well there're two schools of thought on that	3939	A
yeah uh i i played in the band in- in college i played the clarinet B flat clarinet	3939	A
and then uh i took a semester as an elective i took a semester of class piano and i have a piano and an and an organ not a very fancy organ	3939	A
but it's an old Hammond	3939	A
uh	3939	A
and uh i i can sight read most church hymns	3939	A
and uh	3939	A
oh the First Movement of Moonlight sonata that goes of course very slowly	3939	A
uh	3939	A
no not as on a regular basis	3939	A
uh i	3939	A
that's going to be my retirement	3939	A
activity if i can ever ever retire	3939	A
yeah i i do sing in my church choir	3939	A
yeah	3939	A
yeah so so i i i do keep up to that extent	3939	A
do- do you play any instruments	3939	A
um-hum	3939	A
um-hum	3939	A
yeah	3939	A
um	3939	A
um-hum	3939	A
listen let let me tell you what my uh my retirement job's going to be	3939	A
uh i've just been to the Meyerson one time and the first part was oh Schubert and you know the usual stuff and then there was this very modern day	3939	A
piece that had no rhythm no tune and just sounded like a bunch of racket	3939	A
and in the the middle of the stage was this box about oh four by four by four covered with black black what i have no idea	3939	A
how do you uh feel about the metric system	3910	A
well	3910	A
yeah i'll tell you i was i was thinking about it while i was waiting for a connection	3910	A
and i in my business i have to do conversions back and forth between metric tons and uh then i converted into barrels and gallons and then i deal with long tons and so forth and so on and i will admit that it does make it uh	3910	A
uh perhaps a little bit cumbersome at the same time i don't know it's one of the oddities one of the few things that are left you know is is as the world shrinks we become more and more homogenized everybody	3910	A
yeah it seems to uh uh you know it it's like it's like accents even you know there's not used to be there's a great variation across the US and now with television everybody is beginning to sound like uh a news uh announcer you know-	3910	A
and and the whole um i don't know it-	3910	A
yeah but i i don't know i kind of got a soft spot in my uh my heart for feet and inches even though i- i like i say in in my business i do have to uh to work around it	3910	A
yeah	3910	A
you know i think one of one of the reasons that i've got some hesitancy about doing it is that i still have a difficult time	3910	A
i mean there are few of pieces of the metric system that i can visualize okay i- i- i've gotten pretty good at at at you know i realize about that how long a a meter is	3910	A
okay but as far as you know and it's uh i've kind of got the conversion of different parts of the metric system where i'm comfortable with it but i'm not with weights	3910	A
and and until i- i- i guess it would be something that if i had been uh uh a little more educated in it or forced into using it more i might be more comfortable with it	3910	A
uh-huh	3910	A
well well sure it'd take a new generation- it would take a new generation to be just you know completely metric	3910	A
yeah i think you're right	3910	A
yeah	3910	A
well you know they try to in one of the in one of the parts of the question they ask you know just- ask to- ask us to discuss was uh uh	3910	A
why why the first attempt failed you know and i was thinking- i don't- i don't know i- i don't really have a good answer for that other than i guess it was just that much uh uh resistance to change	3910	A
that's true and and the other thing too they're they were going to use both systems you know simultaneously	3910	A
right	3910	A
yeah they didn't -until uh you know uh strawberries by anything but uh kilograms then you know rather than pounds	3910	A
sure	3910	A
yeah and then and then you could you know people would start looking- seeing a you know a quantity and they would say well hey that you know that's about- that looks to be about two pounds and hey that's this much you know in metric so you know	3910	A
um-hum um-hum	3910	A
yeah of course i've i do think there's always that there's still kind of a uh i don't know a a romance if you will with the idea of a yard being the uh the link from the king's nose to the tip of his uh finger or you know	3910	A
so i you know and and that- that and i- i think i don't know then all these other old English stories that go back you know that with our uh with our system of measurement	3910	A
yeah	3910	A
yeah although- although- although although there are	3910	A
well uh i i was just talking to my dad about that just a couple of weeks ago and i think i think it'd be great that we went to it	3910	B
and uh the- the one thing though that i think we should do if we go to the metric system then we should do away with the other system and and have only the metric system	3910	B
uh-huh	3910	B
right	3910	B
yeah yeah	3910	B
yeah	3910	B
yeah	3910	B
well that's true	3910	B
yeah	3910	B
yeah	3910	B
yeah that's true you're right you're right there's no losing we're losing our culture of our area uh-huh	3910	B
sure yeah	3910	B
yeah well i uh i work in a hospital and of course that's all we use and every- and every thing we do is metric you know and uh you know weights is in kilograms and uh you know whatever- whatever is whatever happens to be the thing that we're measuring it's in metric	3910	B
and uh	3910	B
yeah yeah	3910	B
right right	3910	B
yeah	3910	B
yeah	3910	B
yeah yeah sure right	3910	B
well uh uh one one of the things that really i- i really think it would be sort of weird is is the uh cars the miles per hour instead of having uh having kilometers- um kilometers per hour	3910	B
no matter what you-	3910	B
that's right that's right because it's hard to it's just like uh another language i guess	3910	B
and when you learn another language um i guess what you have to do is try to think in that language and not think in in terms of translating it to English you know but	3910	B
yeah yeah	3910	B
i think so too and i think that uh that it was- it was pretty much optional wasn't it at the time and and uh	3910	B
yeah that's right see that's why i think it is i think they used both systems and everybody as long as they had inches they could just transpose back and forth and it made it difficult so everybody thought well this is too much trouble	3910	B
but uh of course if you didn't have anything available but metrics i think it'd be a little easier on you you know	3910	B
that's right that's right you- you'd you would just quit thinking you wouldn't worry about how many ounces is this you would just say well how many how many uh grams is it you know and	3910	B
yeah	3910	B
sure yeah yeah and it's uh like weight you know i- i weigh about a hundred and sixty five and that's i know somewhere in the neighborhood of seventy something kilograms you know and it's- it's hard to imagine well only seventy something you feel like you don't weigh much you know	3910	B
but um i guess if that's the only thing you knew well you would just know well i weigh seventy something kilograms and that's it you know	3910	B
well that's true	3910	B
yeah i understand that it's that's true that's very true that's very true	3910	B
yeah that's right	3910	B
it's funny that uh i guess all that started in England i guess all the measurement- system of measurement and now uh we're still using it and they are gone they've left it you know and they use metrics there	3910	B
okay	3993	A
what do do you do artistic painting	3993	A
oh you do	3993	A
do you do a lot of it	3993	A
yeah i i took one class about_1 i guess three or four years ago and i've done a little	3993	A
um but it takes a lot of time	3993	A
do-	3993	A
do you sell your projects	3993	A
uh-huh	3993	A
um-hum	3993	A
where do you work at	3993	A
oh	3993	A
now do you ever send any of your stuff to the boutique	3993	A
uh-huh	3993	A
that keeps you busy	3993	A
uh-huh have you tried any of the well do you cut out your own projects	3993	A
huh	3993	A
do you um ever spray your projects with uh i mean a base coat first or do you brush it all on	3993	A
uh-huh	3993	A
i just bought a spray gun one of those airless um not airless high volume low pressure spray guns	3993	A
and i do a lot of wood working and that's what i bought it for	3993	A
but i haven't used it yet	3993	A
yeah yeah	3993	A
um fine furniture type stuff yeah	3993	A
that's why i brought bought the sprayer is to finish my projects that's my worst	3993	A
worst part of my wood working i get so sick of making it	3993	A
yeah	3993	A
but spraying does put on a nicer finish	3993	A
for wood working um let me see table saw scroll saw band saw lathe routers and that's about it	3993	A
yeah it is	3993	A
yeah the band saw's really nice i have an Inca i don't know if you've ever heard of those	3993	A
but yeah it's nice to have the right equipment	3993	A
um-hum	3993	A
um not mostly i do like you do give it away as gifts	3993	A
uh making my own furniture	3993	A
um just in junior high and then i just kept on through high school and then bought my own equipment	3993	A
kept up with that	3993	A
yeah yeah	3993	A
like the shelves and	3993	A
for your tole painting	3993	A
good	3993	A
well i guess i'll let you go now	3993	A
oh they do	3993	A
oh okay so this is my first one you're probably a veteran at this	3993	A
uh-huh	3993	A
yeah sounds fun where do you buy your tole painting paints at around here	3993	A
oh i'm not familiar- well we live in Roy but we haven't is it on nineteen hundred	3993	A
i know where fifty six hundred south is	3993	A
is that Ben Franklin then	3993	A
um i do tole painting	3993	B
uh-huh i really love the tole painting um	3993	B
i haven't done any of the oil or watercolor i would like to learn that some day but right now my passion is tole painting uh-huh	3993	B
oh	3993	B
it does it is real time consuming and	3993	B
uh mostly i have just given them away as gifts um	3993	B
i've done uh perpetual calendars and	3993	B
cookie jar lids and oh on and on you know just things like that but	3993	B
um i would eventually like to make enough to sell and quit my job	3993	B
i just work at Stop and Shop out there in in Ogden so	3993	B
no i've wanted to do that uh but just haven't just haven't mass produced enough to do that	3993	B
so i have five children of my own so it's	3993	B
they they keep me busy and tole painting's just a you know something i do in my spare time so	3993	B
yes uh-huh i have my own saws and so i really enjoy doing that	3993	B
i brush it on yeah i haven't tried a a spray varnish	3993	B
i use just a wood sealer	3993	B
and	3993	B
oh uh-huh	3993	B
do you oh	3993	B
oh well that's that probably give you a smoother finish wouldn't it oh now what type of wood working do you do	3993	B
oh do you	3993	B
oh	3993	B
oh but it's hard to finish it huh	3993	B
oh well that is interesting so what kind of equipment do you have	3993	B
uh-huh	3993	B
boy it sounds like you're really into it that is nice	3993	B
yeah i i just have a scroll saw and a jig saw and i am really anxious to get a band saw and a router	3993	B
oh	3993	B
yeah that is that makes it easier doesn't it well have you sold any of your furniture or	3993	B
just	3993	B
uh-huh	3993	B
oh	3993	B
well-	3993	B
oh well that's interesting do you uh did you take classes to learn how to do that	3993	B
uh-huh	3993	B
oh so yours is mostly just a hobby too then oh well that's interesting oh i would i really would love to go take a class in wood working and learn how to	3993	B
i don't know if i necessarily want to do furniture but mostly uh	3993	B
just do more uh-huh the wood working	3993	B
uh	3993	B
yeah	3993	B
yeah so it's fun	3993	B
well they come on we're supposed to talk until they come on and tell us yeah well it's it has been really fun i've enjoyed this um	3993	B
like i say i've made a couple of calls to Texas and just talked to all different kinds of people so i think you'll enjoy doing it it's fun	3993	B
um you know there's a shop in Roy that i really love um and it's there by the Copper Mill restaurant used to be the Hayloft	3993	B
uh-huh um let's see i'm trying to think of the name	3993	B
uh i don't not right off	3993	B
Ben Franklin okay	3993	B
yes i'm here	3951	B
oh	3951	B
uh what kind you get	3951	B
how do you like it	3951	B
well that's good	3951	B
my um wife just got a new car a Honda Civic so i think i think it's my turn	3951	B
well a CRX not a Civic i don't why i said Civic yeah	3951	B
yeah she liked it and it's been pretty good so far she's had it about um six months now	3951	B
and um it's been a really good car	3951	B
but i don't know i think she when she got one i should get one so i'm looking although slowly right now	3951	B
pardon me	3951	B
yeah	3951	B
yeah just about everybody- i've never had one but everybody i know who has they don't have too many complaints which is can't be said about a lot of cars	3951	B
but i don't know i think i want a a Chevy Blazer or a GMC Jimmy truck is what i'm looking for a wagon type of deal	3951	B
it'd be good i look was i looked at a Toyota 4-Runner actually it's the same type of deal but smaller kind of like the S-10s	3951	B
for the Chevys and i don't know i like- i like the bigger ones better than the small ones if you're gonna buy a truck you might as well buy the real one instead of a toy truck	3951	B
yeah	3951	B
yeah	3951	B
uh that sounds pretty good i used to have a an S-10 a little truck i don't know was it was more like having a car than a truck so i decided this time i'll get a big one	3951	B
yeah	3951	B
he wants a big one again yeah	3951	B
that has a lot of advantages and i'm up here in New Hampshire so up north with the snow and everything it's a a big advantage to us	3951	B
you from Texas by the way yeah yeah most of the people i talk to on this are from down there i'm one of the few New- East Coast people	3951	B
well that sounds pretty good do you shop around pretty much when you were looking for your car or	3951	B
right	3951	B
yeah	3951	B
yeah	3951	B
yeah	3951	B
oh that's great	3951	B
are those um four cylinders do you know or six cylinder four cylinder	3951	B
yeah you get pretty good gas mileage like	3951	B
around thirty or more than that even or	3951	B
yeah	3951	B
yeah that's a that's about what my wife's car gets	3951	B
little bit over thirty which is pretty good i can't complain right now i have a Ford Escort which is the terrible car but it gets good gas mileage so i can't complain too much but it's ugly and you know it's not real comfortable or anything but	3951	B
i bought it used after i graduated from school and it's getting the job done but it's nothing that i really enjoy	3951	B
uh my brother used to have one of those	3951	B
yeah	3951	B
yeah lot of time in the shop	3951	B
yeah	3951	B
yeah i know about that i had a i had a	3951	B
Ford Thunderbird for a while and	3951	B
fixed or repaired daily is the joke about the Ford and it was pretty accurate with that car i swore up and down i never own another Ford as long lived and i ended up anyway	3951	B
oh i don't think i'll ever have another one after this one but so far it hasn't too mean to me	3951	B
um do you test drive a lot of cars before you um bought them_1	3951	B
yeah	3951	B
yeah	3951	B
okay	3951	A
well are you there	3951	A
okay well i just bought a new car that's why i checked um	3951	A
it's a Toyota Tercel i love it it's really nice yep	3951	A
oh really	3951	A
yeah	3951	A
oh a CRX that's what i was looking at	3951	A
yeah	3951	A
yeah	3951	A
yeah	3951	A
yeah my parents are thinking about getting a Toyota Camry	3951	A
my parents are thinking about getting a Toyota Camry because_1 they're supposed to be i think- i think Toyotas are really good cars	3951	A
hm	3951	A
yeah	3951	A
yeah those are nice	3951	A
yeah	3951	A
yeah	3951	A
well my brother has a my brother just bought a Mazda a little Mazda truck and he loves it course and he's into the little trucks and all and the stereos	3951	A
so	3951	A
um-hum	3951	A
yeah	3951	A
my dad used to have a big full size GMC and um he just bought a little S-10 and now he hates it he wants a full size again yeah	3951	A
he's so used to driving a big truck	3951	A
yeah	3951	A
yeah i'm in Dallas	3951	A
yeah	3951	A
yep	3951	A
i didn't do not much at all i went and looked at a GMC i- i went and looked at a little truck because_1 i just i don't need you know much more and um	3951	A
i went and looked at it and it was just i couldn't afford it or anything	3951	A
so and i was just looking for a little stripped down	3951	A
and they just wanted way too much for it so i was kind of looked around and i was going to look at a	3951	A
mainly the trucks but i also looked at a Nissan Sentra	3951	A
and then i went and i looked at the um Toyota Tercel and i ended up getting it because_1 i really liked it i test drove it and i just love it	3951	A
yep	3951	A
mine's a four cylinder	3951	A
yeah really good	3951	A
it's about thirty i think it's thirty two in the city and uh like thirty out on the highway it's really good	3951	A
yeah	3951	A
yeah	3951	A
yeah i used to have a Buick Skylark an eighty one	3951	A
really mine was not a good car i bought it used and it	3951	A
and then i had a lot of problems with it it just made me so mad that because_1 i had to pretty much go out and get a new car	3951	A
yeah most of the time or sitting out front yeah	3951	A
yeah yep	3951	A
yeah	3951	A
yeah my family's pretty much against Fords too	3951	A
yeah	3951	A
well that's good	3951	A
not really i only i test drove mine the one that i got now and um that's the the only one i went and when i looked at the CRX's uh i just looked at them_1 and they had the lot that i went to the close	3951	A
okay_1 well in the organized i'm with Department of Defense and uh we have random drug testing	3955	A
and uh	3955	A
the last couple of years and people have really you just accepted that of course the soldiers and then uh the civilians they haven't done the civilians yet but	3955	A
personally i don't think see anything wrong with it uh i think it's a protection to employers and to employees and everybody else if	3955	A
uh-huh	3955	A
you bet	3955	A
i really like it the way they do it in the in the military they go by social security numbers and they take the last number and uh	3955	A
so it uh	3955	A
and it- it or or just pick a last number social security numbers uh and that's the way they do it and it works really well	3955	A
and um i work with recruiters a lot and they have uh	3955	A
they have it monthly with recruiters	3955	A
uh no no uh they do it that way but uh well it's every three months excuse me every three months	3955	A
and they have uh we have about um oh a hundred and fifteen recruiters in our area	3955	A
and uh they have a fourth of them_1 every three months they on a random basis	3955	A
but uh	3955	A
no no hasn't come up i don't know i	3955	A
that's fine if it does i the only thing you have to be careful if i know all those who join the service	3955	A
uh it is mandatory that they're tested for drugs	3955	A
and uh if drugs are found uh in the system	3955	A
then uh they're barred for enlistment for six months and then they can come back once and test again and if it's uh still positive then they can't join	3955	A
they've really cracked down on that and uh i think that's that's good because the source of the bad crime of reputation for for drugs	3955	A
but it's surprising uh since they've been on well the first couple of months this has been around for about a year and a half	3955	A
the first few months there was quite a few that were disqualified and uh since then you just never hear of it i guess the word got out and the kids know that if they want to commit and and join then uh they have to be straight	3955	A
the only thing that's kind of scary if you eat one of these buns with cinnamon with these uh poppy seeds on it	3955	A
and that would show up	3955	A
no no it's- it's uh	3955	A
it's kind of strange uh but uh yeah they they tell them_1 that if they uh	3955	A
if they're going to if they come into the motel to stay overnight	3955	A
prior to being physical and tested and then so forth they tell them_1 not to eat anything with poppy seeds on it a hard roll if they're having lunch or something or dinner but	3955	A
well i'm not sure and it just shows that they're uh uh	3955	A
but they they specify that or just tell them_1 that they'll have to kind of be careful well and it's the same with alcoholic beverages they they test for that too	3955	A
and uh i think it's great i really do i mean	3955	A
but in the work place i i feel that it it should be uh something that the employers have the right to do if they want	3955	A
to protect everyone concerned and	3955	A
the the only problem i can see and i've heard is the the fact that if they uh	3955	A
if the test whoever runs the test they've got to make sure they run it correctly so it's not a a misreading on it or something	3955	A
and that that's happened in some instances i guess	3955	A
but uh	3955	A
i think they're pretty well i've heard- what i've heard and especially the ones that that test the the soldiers they uh	3955	A
they make sure they they run them_1 correctly and uh have the right right person with right sample and everything but	3955	A
so	3955	A
uh-huh	3955	A
uh-huh	3955	A
yeah i especially the the uh alcoholic- alcohol part of it uh that's a that's a thing that uh	3955	A
yeah right you really can you can and uh	3955	A
um-hum	3955	B
um-hum	3955	B
yeah the in my mind the people that say that it's in violation of their privacy it's	3955	B
it's actually a violation of the people they work with if uh	3955	B
it's not fair to have people working around you that uh could cause accidents or harm to yourself	3955	B
um-hum	3955	B
is that mandatory for the recruiters	3955	B
um-hum	3955	B
um-hum	3955	B
has-	3955	B
has your number come up	3955	B
um-hum	3955	B
sure	3955	B
um-hum	3955	B
hm	3955	B
um-hum	3955	B
hm	3955	B
yes	3955	B
you're kidding	3955	B
huh	3955	B
hm	3955	B
um-hum	3955	B
well what does it test uh for	3955	B
um-hum	3955	B
yeah	3955	B
um-hum	3955	B
yeah	3955	B
hm	3955	B
um-hum	3955	B
hm	3955	B
um-hum my my company's small enough here that uh	3955	B
in fact i don't know of any companies right around the Twin Falls area that's testing i'm sure they're here	3955	B
but i certainly wouldn't be opposed um is- is it hard for you to tell people that are on drugs i mean	3955	B
and i don't know how you can confirm that or not but uh	3955	B
uh i'd really be surprised if someone in my company was using drugs now it doesn't mean they're that they're not there	3955	B
and maybe the testing wouldn't you know show that they were there	3955	B
but	3955	B
you can see that pretty easy can't you	3955	B
so we're supposed to be talking about	3922	B
hello hello	3922	B
hello	3922	B
yeah i am now wonder what happened	3922	B
oh really i couldn't hear a thing well	3922	B
oh gee	3922	B
i was on a cordless when she called but then i uh	3922	B
i uh never get it to work so i had to go to my other phone	3922	B
anyway we're supposed to be discussing clothing right um	3922	B
yeah where do you work	3922	B
oh you work for TI oh okay	3922	B
yeah	3922	B
um-hum	3922	B
our office is so cold i usually try to wear i wear suits most of the time except on Friday we have casual day	3922	B
i mean we can wear jeans i'm not a jeans wearer but i wear pants but um a lot of people in the office dress fairly casual most of the time	3922	B
uh they do carry me through yes uh most of them_1 i can wear all year i just you know i just buy the	3922	B
they're um Leslie Fay makes a haberdashery and um i can even wash them_1 in my washing machine	3922	B
yeah and um so they're not too heavy for	3922	B
summer or winter or just anytime so i i'd usually buy maybe a lighter color you know like for the summer then i won't wear the real light ones in the winter but	3922	B
uh-huh	3922	B
yeah	3922	B
uh-huh	3922	B
uh-huh	3922	B
right	3922	B
yeah	3922	B
uh-huh uh-huh yeah that makes it nice	3922	B
oh you are well congratulations	3922	B
huh	3922	B
oh	3922	B
yeah	3922	B
oh yeah that's nice	3922	B
uh	3922	B
uh-huh	3922	B
yeah	3922	B
uh-huh	3922	B
oh	3922	B
yeah	3922	B
um-hum	3922	B
yeah	3922	B
well our company's our company allows jeans on Friday	3922	B
uh everybody wears you know most everybody wears jeans but	3922	B
they're real- kind of particular you know what kind of jeans or what kind of shirts you wear with them they'll you know they want you to look nice	3922	B
and uh	3922	B
everybody's pretty good about-	3922	B
Clo yes i'm here are you here	3922	A
i can hear you just fine	3922	A
are you there	3922	A
okay i don't know i could hear you fine yeah	3922	A
huh	3922	A
i was i mean the whole time i could hear you say hello and i was trying to i don't- i'm on a cordless phone so i thought well maybe something happened	3922	A
oh	3922	A
yes	3922	A
at work i guess um i work for TI	3922	A
and um it's pretty casual i mean it can be pretty casual it seems like um well with- our weather that we have here in Texas that um	3922	A
you can usually get about three seasons out of clothing the the only stuff is sometimes i get more casual during the summer	3922	A
and it doesn't last you know past Labor Day or i mean or what is the the one in the fall	3922	A
um-hum	3922	A
um-hum	3922	A
um-hum	3922	A
and do your suits carry you through all four seasons or do you have lighter suits that you wear	3922	A
and	3922	A
um-hum	3922	A
oh great	3922	A
um-hum	3922	A
hm um well i know that like my husband wears suits all year long but you know the men's suits seem to come in different weights like tropical weight or	3922	A
you know uh i mean he wears wool in the summer but it's a lighter weight and it it it is uh a lot thinner so it breathes better than a a polyester would	3922	A
the wool does and and i wear suits occasionally at work at but a lot of it depends on	3922	A
what- what i've got going like if i've if i'm gonna be meeting with customers	3922	A
i don't um you know dress up as much and it it depends on what kind of meetings i have	3922	A
but um fortunately TI is flexible enough that um you know i can do that	3922	A
yeah	3922	A
although right now i'm having more difficulty finding things to wear i'm expecting and and uh	3922	A
i'm in that thank you i'm in that in between stage where where not showing enough to wear maternity clothes but	3922	A
but uh my old clothes are getting kind of tight so so i've started um uh one friend of mine at work lent me a bunch of units	3922	A
stuff you know and yeah so that'll be great to wear you know units pants with the sweaters so fortunately TI is flexible enough that	3922	A
you know we can dress kind of casual like that although i get i get tired of it you know and i don't have	3922	A
Friday has been my casual day since probably high school even through college it was just kind of ingrained in me that Friday was always a kind of a casual day	3922	A
so i do that even at work it's more it if i do wear jeans that might be the day that i wear them_1	3922	A
but but they don't fit anymore	3922	A
hello yeah	3930	A
yeah well i uh on capital punishment here in Utah it uh	3930	A
we do have the death penalty for murder	3930	A
and uh	3930	A
the	3930	A
uh	3930	A
the- either the jury or the judge can make that determination depending on the crime the seriousness of the crime	3930	A
it's been uh uh	3930	A
it's been uh oh it's been four or five years ago since uh someone was actually uh put on death row well there's some quite a few on death row but uh before one was executed	3930	A
and it uh we've got some that uh have been there for ten or fifteen years and	3930	A
i don't know my opinion on on uh the death penalty i think it's uh	3930	A
personally i think it would be a deterrent if uh they were able to carry this out without many appeals	3930	A
but they appeal and appeal and uh it just goes on forever but	3930	A
uh-huh it really does and uh uh i i have i've always felt that uh	3930	A
if they murder someone in cold uh in cold blood they know what they're doing and uh	3930	A
that they should be uh	3930	A
pay made to pay for it but if we don't have a deterrent of some kind then it just gets to the point where	3930	A
and if people it's just if they want to do it they do it and then they they think well i'll be out in uh	3930	A
two or three years and a lot of them are	3930	A
uh-huh right	3930	A
uh-huh	3930	A
right	3930	A
what if the	3930	A
where it's so clear cut we've had a couple cases here where they were actually caught and they uh and they had witnesses where they had killed two or three people	3930	A
and there was one that they thought they'd killed but they hadn't and they had the witness and	3930	A
and uh they did all kinds of things to these poor people	3930	A
and this one they thought they had killed him but uh they hadn't and the the police were able to get them but they they did uh were able to uh have the one uh	3930	A
executed but the other one is still appealing and uh	3930	A
it's uh	3930	A
it's really a sad thing especially for the families of those that were involved	3930	A
uh-huh	3930	A
right and and they don't have the crime rate that we have here i know my son uh was over in Saudi Arabia but he was over there during the war and he said man somebody over there	3930	A
uh they they kill someone and the and uh that's it they're killed or they	3930	A
right and so he says you really don't have that he could see the crime rate was very low over there because people knew the consequences	3930	A
but here it's got to the point where i think it's gone too far the other way	3930	A
uh	3930	A
that's true	3930	A
well i know made in the point you made about the taxpayer paying for it when you start considering the cost of fifty to sixty thousand dollars a year to keep them in prison	3930	A
plus all the attorney costs all of that the taxpayers pay for	3930	A
and uh the victims they don't get anything other than just the heartache and going through this and going through it appeal after appeal and i don't know i	3930	A
uh-huh and then they find some little glitch uh in the law and uh you either turn them loose or	3930	A
or put them in prison for life and then maybe after a few years they're paroled	3930	A
so i don't know it's it's uh quite a situation i	3930	A
i wish they'd get back to that but uh every once in a while there was a fellow that was executed in uh Wyoming the state next to us	3930	A
uh about a month ago and uh of course he he said he wanted to be because he he had done the you know he he admitted to it and everything he said i just don't want to stay in prison and	3930	A
so the lawyers couldn't do anything to stop that one but anyway it's uh	3930	A
i	3930	A
well it does and then you try to teach your children uh respect for for uh	3930	A
okay	3930	B
hello yeah okay	3930	B
uh-huh	3930	B
yeah that's the same way it is here	3930	B
right right it's just nothing but cost the taxpayers lots of money huh	3930	B
yeah and then they end up doing it again	3930	B
no i think that's very very very wrong	3930	B
um i'm with you i think if they if they've killed somebody they should they should pay for it	3930	B
you know period no you know none of this going on and on and on and on	3930	B
uh-huh	3930	B
yeah you know i don't in other countries i don't think they do that if someone does something bad like that they just	3930	B
do it right now you know	3930	B
uh-huh	3930	B
yeah they pay for it right now yeah	3930	B
right	3930	B
yeah you know like- like you say you know anything they do they don't care they could go out and rob somebody if they get caught they know they're just going to be out in just a little while anyhow	3930	B
so it's the same thing you know but uh i just don't think that they should let it go on and on and on like they do	3930	B
yeah right	3930	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3930	B
yeah they make it wait for so long and then people forget actually what did happen you know	3930	B
yeah right right	3930	B
yeah	3930	B
uh-huh	3930	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3930	B
it makes you wonder how they can live with themselves when they do something like that huh	3930	B
i'm Bridget	3980	A
oh bull is this Mrs Slaubacher what are you doing	3980	A
the same thing okay hold on	3980	A
okay	3980	A
well i don't have kids so it's kind of hard to say	3980	A
but i think that i mean i think it's kind of sad that like they're talking about like what the trends are today i think it's kind of sad that people are so uh	3980	A
involved with their careers and stuff that they don't take time for their kids i think it's really sad i think they should reevaluate their priorities	3980	A
because_1 i was waiting to get someone that would say yeah well you know it's hard to spend time with my kids and i was just gonna be like gritting my teeth hoping not to say something i didn't mean to	3980	A
but i think it's really sad	3980	A
yeah see	3980	A
see i do too i agree	3980	A
no	3980	A
i know if you don't if you wanna have a career that's fine but i don't think you should have kids you know or wait till you're	3980	A
ready to give up some of it	3980	A
uh-huh really	3980	A
really	3980	A
that's great	3980	A
that they waited	3980	A
see i know	3980	A
uh-huh	3980	A
yeah	3980	A
and-	3980	A
see i see too i mean i it sounds bad and i know people would totally disagree and say it shouldn't have to be a choice but for the welfare of the kid i think it is	3980	A
or at least it uh-huh yep i'm in Lubbock	3980	A
that's hilarious must have been right when you said something i knew that was you i was like oh my gosh	3980	A
God anything i mean take them_1 to the park on Saturday or God i mean even if they say they don't have time for kids they should sit down and eat dinner with their kids that would take all of thirty minutes	3980	A
yeah	3980	A
yeah	3980	A
yeah i just think it's important	3980	A
yeah especially you had so many kids too though so you get to hear the whole scoop on everyone because_1 everyone would know	3980	A
uh-huh	3980	A
do you really	3980	A
oh	3980	A
how cute	3980	A
uh-huh	3980	A
really see that's great	3980	A
i'd love to do that	3980	A
see this is important i know i- i get engaged and my mom's like so how long you think it'll till you have kids and i was like God i'm not even married yet uh	3980	A
don't start saying kids i'm not ready	3980	A
yeah	3980	A
yeah that's of important	3980	A
for each so they don't feel like there isn't singled out	3980	A
see	3980	A
yeah just as long	3980	A
hi hi i'm Joan this is a riot i- i'm making money what are you doing	3980	B
push your one and let's get with it	3980	B
okay so what do you think about raising kids you don't know anything about this	3980	B
it is kind of hard for you	3980	B
um-hum	3980	B
i do to	3980	B
that's true	3980	B
right right but i- i think you need to take that for the little bit of time it takes like for or about	3980	B
ten years out of your life of really being around them_1 when they really need you and their younger ages it's worth that ten years and it pays off i think	3980	B
because_1 the ten years isn't long till you can work on your career and then you have forty years more to do your career	3980	B
yeah	3980	B
that's true	3980	B
that's true what well you know some of the um	3980	B
i see it with our teachers that have waited for it till they're thirty four thirty five	3980	B
and they have that first one and boy you'd think they were the only ones that ever had kids	3980	B
they and yeah they really love it	3980	B
i think they're kind of sorry then they didn't that they waited that long because_1 they really enjoy them a lot	3980	B
and i see that a lot with the young girls that think that's all they wanted was careers and then when they hit around thirty four thirty five they decide well the really want to try motherhood	3980	B
and uh that happens but i agree if they if they want a career though i think they should go with the career and forget the kids when	3980	B
yeah	3980	B
yeah right	3980	B
right are you at school now are you that's a riot yes	3980	B
um what are some of the things you think the parents should do with their kids	3980	B
right	3980	B
yeah see i think that dinner time is real important with kids that's when a lot of things would come out	3980	B
that if you and you'd make i know that when they're all going all different directions but i used to at least make three meals- three meals out of a week they had to be together	3980	B
and i kind of insist on it and they were pretty good about it they hated to miss it because_1 they'd hear about the good time we had if they weren't around	3980	B
yeah i do too because_1 that's when i don't know why but kids start talking when you're when you're around a dinner table and all they start telling all the things	3980	B
yeah	3980	B
yeah	3980	B
and uh but i think any- any entertainment that you can do with them_1 is fun though when when you know we always loved to go camping	3980	B
and that's great even even now we go camping in fact we have one set up in May	3980	B
and the grand kids come now it's the grand kids i mean we started out when the kids were young doing this and now they bring their babies um Mary's baby was four weeks old when we took her	3980	B
we took him and uh we start them_1 out real young even and in the winter we just take electric blankets and put them_1 on	3980	B
they and they love that outdoors	3980	B
yeah and they go fishing from the time they're little and uh the daddies take them_1 out in the boats it's fun	3980	B
yeah	3980	B
yeah	3980	B
but i think any any outings with kids is wonderful makes you get to know them better and another thing i like is um just making sure you have time with each one alone	3980	B
yeah even you you know no matter how many you have you should take a special day a special time for one	3980	B
yeah and make that day for shopping or going out to lunch or just taking them_1 to the park alone and you'd be surprised what they'll talk about when you're just sitting there on a swing talking	3980	B
hi this- my name's Bridgette	3909	A
hi nice to meet you um do you know what we're supposed to talk about	3909	A
yeah so are you ready then okay	3909	A
uh-huh okay so what do you think is wrong with the school system	3909	A
uh-huh	3909	A
uh-huh	3909	A
yeah i agree with that but that's coming from because_1 i'm in college right now and seeing how the school systems are my mom's a teacher that's very hard to do in some areas you know it's like they sent	3909	A
and i know where my mom teaches you know and she teaches in like a lower class	3909	A
part of Plano and where it is is they just send their kids to school and you know they don't care if they do their homework if they don't do their homework whatever	3909	A
so she says it's very hard from that aspect i mean she'll call the parents and they you know they're like well- you know that's not my responsibility it's yours	3909	A
and i know she gets real frustrated being a teacher that she feels like you know that the parents aren't willing to do that which is very scary i think	3909	A
another- another thing i think though is uh i know now because_1 i'm getting ready to graduate and friends of mine that are getting teaching degrees are um	3909	A
people that aren't getting a master's are having an easier time uh getting a job because_1 they can get paid less	3909	A
uh-huh	3909	A
yeah	3909	A
yeah uh-huh i think it was	3909	A
uh-huh	3909	A
yeah	3909	A
uh-huh	3909	A
i think it's hard though because_1 even like the like in high school and stuff you take the standardized tests and stuff and i know people that you know are like dyslexic- i mean i know people in college that are like dyslexic	3909	A
that i wonder how they pass through all their school you know all their years of school	3909	A
and pass through all the tests that they had to pass through and so forth to get to college because_1 they have the hardest time you know things like that always make me wonder too i mean they make all these tests but are they really proving anything	3909	A
yeah that's definitely true	3909	A
um-hum	3909	A
see yeah	3909	A
um-hum	3909	A
yeah i agree i think there's just so many problems now with just kids you know younger these days and	3909	A
all the problems they have and all the problems like in general in the world like with gangs and stuff just being brought into the school is making it worse i think that's not even helping at all	3909	A
yeah	3909	A
Bridgette this is Maureen	3909	B
yeah if there's something wrong with the school system	3909	B
sure	3909	B
right	3909	B
oh	3909	B
you there okay	3909	B
well you know i was listening to uh Sixty Minutes i think the other night they had Andy Rooney on there and one of the comments he was making is that um	3909	B
you know part of the problem is uh parents and um	3909	B
their lack i guess of uh interest in the kids in school and he said do you know basically until we change that	3909	B
uh we're not gonna have the kids uh get any smarter because um you know they're not encouraging their kids to do well in school so	3909	B
otherwise we're not gonna ever achieve a good education system unless we really get the parents involved	3909	B
um-hum	3909	B
yeah	3909	B
right	3909	B
um	3909	B
yeah	3909	B
oh yeah	3909	B
yeah it's kind of a shame that um we don't put emphasis and money where we really should i mean we've never really paid teachers real well	3909	B
we've never paid um other public servants like the police and such very well it is kind of a shame um	3909	B
there are some times i think that uh you know the quality of teachers may be improved upon i think what they did a few years ago was kind of a joke about testing the teachers and all	3909	B
um i think that i think that they're made some changes you know into um	3909	B
the the kind of courses that should be involved in education curriculum and um trying to improve- improve upon them uh somewhat but	3909	B
um they've never really paid you know real well and and you know people have to pick a an occupation that's gonna support themselves it can't be all sacrifice and no you know salary you got to live on something	3909	B
but	3909	B
um-hum	3909	B
um	3909	B
yeah	3909	B
um-hum	3909	B
yeah true and you know some people are much better test takers than others um	3909	B
some people you know um just really clam up when it comes to a test and they're so nervous about well is there a is this a trick question and instead of being real straight forward and just trying to answer it they	3909	B
and then other people you know aren't that upset about it and they test very well so there has to be	3909	B
different ways of of testing sometimes you know because um that isn't always a real good reflection of if the person's learned it or not	3909	B
yeah you know uh i i wouldn't wanna be back in school now i think it uh it's a real challenge and you know um i think maybe the kids need more um	3909	B
i don't know counseling or or psychologists- you know psychologist or just you know talking about how to get along in life if they're not getting that so much from home	3909	B
i'm ready	3963	A
uh no i haven't the only thing i had to i had to return was a table top but that was like three years ago of a dining room table that i got	3963	A
it was marked on the top of it so all they did was replace it	3963	A
but as far as um lawn mowers i've bought lawn mowers in the last three and a half years	3963	A
and they've been working fine my hedger's working fine my weedeater's working fine i haven't really had to return anything you know except that table top that was marked	3963	A
no i said anything	3963	A
oh you did	3963	A
uh-huh	3963	A
huh	3963	A
um-hum	3963	A
um-hum	3963	A
well did- did they give you any back- any problem or they just give you a new one or what	3963	A
um	3963	A
yeah right	3963	A
uh-huh	3963	A
um-hum	3963	A
yeah right	3963	A
um-hum	3963	A
um-hum	3963	A
um-hum	3963	A
um-hum	3963	A
yeah if you go and buy something really good usually it is it's good you know	3963	A
and you don't ever anyhow i've haven't ever had any problems in returning anything	3963	A
that i've bought that i feel that you know was worth the money that you pay for it	3963	A
um-hum	3963	A
um-hum	3963	A
um-hum um-hum	3963	A
um-hum	3963	A
um-hum	3963	A
yeah i i've been really lucky knock on wood you know like i say that i haven't had to return anything except this this table when it came out	3963	A
the top of it was marked and so all i did was replace the top of it you know	3963	A
they they gave me well no i didn't go to the store and get it they you know got with the manufacturer and then when it came in then they brought it out and then just took this table top off and replaced it with the other table top	3963	A
um-hum	3963	A
um-hum	3963	A
um-hum	3963	A
um-hum	3963	A
um-hum	3963	A
oh really	3963	A
uh-huh	3963	A
yeah with	3963	A
or with a veneer top or something like that probably yeah	3963	A
uh-huh	3963	A
oh for crying out loud	3963	A
um-hum um-hum	3963	A
just sent it to you that's weird you'd think that they would have wrote a letter or at least a telephone call you know telling you that this is what was happening you know	3963	A
but um you know but um	3963	A
yeah i was just i was just trying to think of um what else have i bought	3963	A
the only other thing that when we moved in this house it was a new house and the grate where you have your fireplace	3963	A
okay have you returned anything lately	3963	B
hm	3963	B
uh	3963	B
um-hum	3963	B
um-hum	3963	B
hm	3963	B
now okay wait wait a there was a topic talking about_1 returning lawn equipment	3963	B
or was it anything	3963	B
oh okay	3963	B
now okay um well i uh i returned a camera recently i i bought a little uh Minolta camera	3963	B
and uh the auto focus was inconsistent sometimes it would focus and sometimes it wouldn't	3963	B
so uh after my second roll of film i i took two rolls before i got decided uh because_1 i changed the first roll out before i had the first one developed	3963	B
and after i got the first roll back i knew the camera wasn't it so i uh i took it back and returned it but most i don't know i haven't had to return a lot of stuff	3963	B
well i took it back and i figured it was i don't know something like an auto focus i don't know i figured something inherent in the camera design or something	3963	B
so i because my dad has a has an auto focus camera	3963	B
and it works great and he's never had any problems in fact he's he's had a couple of them_1 and this is a like a little small one you know and the new smaller cameras are like all mass produced and stuff	3963	B
so they're not uh i think they're more- uh i would think there there's better quality control on those things you know just because_1 they're small and stamped and there's not very sophisticated	3963	B
so i guess not call it quality control but you know since they're so generic they wouldn't uh there's you know	3963	B
i i my dad has a big sophisticated camera and it always takes good pictures so i just said well hell with it i'll just go out and get a nice camera	3963	B
but uh so i took it back and uh i bought a	3963	B
oh um-hum um-hum	3963	B
yeah	3963	B
um-hum	3963	B
yeah and i think uh the way i was raised my parents always uh used to buy stuff that had a good quality name on it and you know they knew the quality of it before they bought it	3963	B
so i don't know and i kind of do the same thing i guess so i haven't had to return a lot if i had had to return it it's more because_1 i realize i didn't need it or you know not because_1 it's defective	3963	B
but uh more because_1 uh you know i have the option to take it back and i really didn't need it you know	3963	B
rather than you know something being broken	3963	B
but that's that's the only thing i've returned recently	3963	B
um-hum	3963	B
hm	3963	B
did they send you a new one or did they actually give you a new one at the store	3963	B
um-hum	3963	B
um-hum	3963	B
yeah because_1 i bought some furniture where the top was scratched and uh i just wrote a letter to the manufacturer well they they had a warranty sheet saying if you have any damage send this in	3963	B
so i sent it in and uh you know i didn't really think much the table like i said the table was just scratched on the top and uh	3963	B
i didn't really it didn't really bother me because_1 it was kind of small	3963	B
but i went ahead and sent something in and uh	3963	B
three or four weeks later they sent me a brand new table top	3963	B
and it came by truck	3963	B
and uh i like it was probably more expensive to ship this thing than it cost me for the table top itself	3963	B
because_1 uh it was eighty five dollars for shipping and the whole- it was a like a computer table you know made with just like uh uh what do they call pressed board or whatever just pressed- particle board	3963	B
right and uh the whole table was only like a hundred and ten bucks	3963	B
so i was kind of surprised i figured you know i sent that in maybe they would send me something back saying you know uh do you want to exchange it or bring it in or send it back or something like that	3963	B
but uh i couldn't believe they sent actually sent a brand new one and they no calls no letters nothing they just sent it to me	3963	B
yeah yeah	3963	B
definitely	3963	B
yeah yeah uh	3963	B
um-hum um-hum yeah but	3963	B
oh well but	3963	B
i'd say that's a kind of a short topic this time	3963	B
um-hum	3963	B
right	3963	B
uh yeah what what have you thought anything about another- another car	3938	A
it's about time to start thinking isn't it	3938	A
isn't it a pain to look for cars i i hate it i really do as a matter of fact i've got my car is uh i have a an eighty seven Lincoln	3938	A
and uh i just put it in the shop about oh two weeks ago	3938	A
and just spent about twelve hundred dollars on it i decided to get everything that's wrong with it fixed new brakes new shocks new mufflers and all that because i'm going to keep it till it dies	3938	A
i know it well and the other thing is too uh it it's just i mean	3938	A
the the prices- the way the prices have gone up in the past four or five years is- uh it just unbelievable	3938	A
yeah	3938	A
yeah	3938	A
uh-huh	3938	A
uh-huh	3938	A
i understand that uh i i do i understand that	3938	A
insurance- insurance yeah and	3938	A
right right well i've i really have uh you know like i say i i feel like i have made a commitment now to drive the car that i've got which you know and- and and after i will admit after i had those repairs made on it i felt like you know it felt like it was new again	3938	A
yeah and i was very pleased with the money i had put into it which is odd that i ever walk away from spending any money on a car that i felt good about but in	3938	A
but in this particular instance i did because_1 everything felt like they just tightened everything up somehow but uh but i had decided kind of you know just without really giving it a whole lot of thought	3938	A
that when i do buy again uh i bought this car that i've got new but probably what i'm going to do sometime in the future is uh i'm going to look around for a good clean used car a year or two old	3938	A
yeah yeah	3938	A
well and let- you know on- on that note i think anyone you talk with is going to have a different viewpoint on automobiles and really- and the other thing is too i i don't think that it- what- what	3938	A
is true for one person may not necessarily be true for another because other you know so many different people have different needs and and and desires as uh as far as cars are concerned but uh	3938	A
it's just the the kind- the i know if i go out to buy a new one i mean i know what kind of money it would take to do it and i just don't want to pay that much money	3938	A
yeah i leased one car	3938	A
yeah i did that one time i had a i got an eighty five or rather it was a uh well it actually started to lease an eighty four and it was a three year lease	3938	A
you know the only thing about it is i mean it was simple to get into and it really wasn't bad to get out of	3938	A
but you pay that money every month and then you're finished with it and you don't have nothing to show for it granted if you had	3938	A
spent that money buying one you still wouldn't have much to show for it but you would have at least a little	3938	A
so it's it you know i i think it depends i i i guess there's certain instances that that could be the best thing to do but i don't think i'll go that route again	3938	A
yes i have a nineteen eighty one	3938	B
yes and so uh i've actually been looking around and then then things got too busy and it's too complicated out there so	3938	B
yes yes	3938	B
uh-huh	3938	B
well that that's kind of uh i was the brakes didn't feel like they were working and uh people- uh people were saying you know don't you get rid of it every three years and everything and i really was thinking about that then it was like	3938	B
get a loan then you've got to do these you've got to investigate it you've got to check all these things does it have that you you know you can't just go to this dealer you really need to check them all and	3938	B
you can't fall in love with one you've got to be able to turn your back on and then- by the time everyone had given me their advice i thought you know this car turns on every morning	3938	B
yes yes	3938	B
right no that's right and and uh the only thing i need is uh i'm not really into cars so i just need something to get me somewhere	3938	B
and i wanted an air bag i thought that would really be a nice thing to have Volvos are safe cars the other thing is i drive all parts of town	3938	B
and all of sudden the idea of driving in a newish looking car made me much more vulnerable to something happening to it than the car i'm in	3938	B
um-hum	3938	B
like a good car right	3938	B
um-hum	3938	B
that you felt good about yeah	3938	B
yes yeah yeah	3938	B
yes that's exactly what they told me they told me too they said you should get it two years because i don't know because_1 the price has come down that much in the two years	3938	B
and and uh X number of miles you know or like eleven thousand miles i can't remember- i mean people had all these formulas i just felt intimidated- so intimidated	3938	B
yeah yeah	3938	B
um-hum um-hum um-hum	3938	B
yeah	3938	B
uh-huh and yeah well the- that's my feeling too and eventually they'll be coming out with cars that you know have much better gas mileage or use different kind of gas which is something that matters to me	3938	B
so um if you know if i can keep this one going i mean then uh you know i even considered leasing they talked about leasing i looked into that and then that you know then no it doesn't- it makes sense for this kind of thing but not for that	3938	B
oh you did	3938	B
uh-huh	3938	B
uh-huh	3938	B
yes yeah	3938	B
you have nothing left yeah	3938	B
right right	3938	B
yeah	3938	B
yeah	3938	B
well and people told me if you're the kind who buys a new car every two to four years that your	3938	B
i'm ready do you exercise uh during the day time or go to a gym or anything	3952	A
um-hum	3952	A
uh-hum well i try to do it at night before i go to bed um it's really weird because i'll get down on the floor and i'll holler and tell my cat Nikki i'll say Nikki i'm going to do my exercises now	3952	A
and she can be upstairs in the bedroom and i don't know she knows what i'm talking about you know pretty soon here she comes	3952	A
so i lay out there in the living room floor and do my {exercisings} you know uh i had a problem with my back so	3952	A
when i went to physical therapy they gave me some exercises for my back	3952	A
so i just try to keep that up because it seems like if i don't then then my back gives me a problem again	3952	A
so i try to do it every night and uh yeah it seems like it's	3952	A
you know i can tell when i do it and when i don't do it you know so you know it's got to be good for you	3952	A
but um a long time ago i belonged to a gym but uh now i notice that this in this small city that i live in they do have a a gym that just opened up here about a month ago	3952	A
so i was kind of thinking about joining it but i haven't even gone down there and talked to them_1 yet	3952	A
but um it does really make you feel good and i like to bicycle too	3952	A
so that gives you you know lots of exercise	3952	A
so	3952	A
um-hum	3952	A
oh my goodness	3952	A
yeah otherwise you wouldn't be able to go very far huh	3952	A
oh really uh-huh	3952	A
um-hum	3952	A
yeah	3952	A
yeah well like i say i just do it at night you know and um	3952	A
do you like you try try to get my stomach muscles toned up	3952	A
you know because boy they seem like they really get out of shape and once you get out of shape it's hard to get back into shape	3952	A
you know so i just been doing it i try to do it every night you know like i say it just i'd rather do that than watch television anyhow	3952	A
you know so it just kind of nice and especially when i have my cat that- comes down and joins me	3952	A
you know so well i guess that's about all and i can tell you about my exercising i wish i knew how to swim but i don't so i don't go swimming	3952	A
um-hum but they do say that swimming is really really good for you you know for every part of your body	3952	A
so i wished i i wished i did know how to do that if they had a pool here in Patterson i'd probably you know put my bathing suit on and go down there but they don't have a pool in this small city either	3952	A
so well listen then it's been nice talking to you	3952	A
okay then bye-bye	3952	A
all right	3952	B
oh	3952	B
yeah i i used to go to a gym um last summer but then i started school again so it's um so i don't exercise as much as i'd like	3952	B
but i i do enjoy um going to a gym and working out or just like i do sit ups sometimes before i go to bed or when i wake up and i ride a exercise bike a lot so	3952	B
um-hum	3952	B
uh-huh	3952	B
um-hum	3952	B
um-hum	3952	B
oh	3952	B
right	3952	B
oh that's good	3952	B
um-hum	3952	B
right	3952	B
uh-huh	3952	B
hm	3952	B
yeah	3952	B
oh yeah	3952	B
yeah it does yeah i enjoy that a lot i um bike in the summer i belong to a biking club here in Kenosha	3952	B
no huh-uh no i go with my dad he exercises a lot more than i do though oh yeah he's always exercising	3952	B
but i'm not that energetic i can get lazy sometimes	3952	B
yeah	3952	B
oh yeah that's what i like to do	3952	B
um-hum yeah	3952	B
yeah	3952	B
oh wow	3952	B
oh yeah that is neat	3952	B
yeah um i don't swim much neither	3952	B
yeah	3952	B
um-hum	3952	B
oh	3952	B
yeah it's- nice talking to you	3952	B
okay um bye	3952	B
um-hum	3920	A
um-hum	3920	A
it	3920	A
oh i see	3920	A
yeah well i	3920	A
right	3920	A
well they they can get them_1 one way or the other i i think it's uh i probably rate it maybe on the scale of one to ten maybe uh seven or eight	3920	A
uh i think well the automatic weapons and these assault weapons and all of these things that uh i think that is something that	3920	A
uh	3920	A
really be limited but like you say if they take uh if they have gun control- control then they take away uh the citizens right to protect themselves	3920	A
and we live out in the west where uh of course i have a number of guns and each one of my sons have guns and we go hunting quite a bit for deer and	3920	A
and uh	3920	A
uh pheasants and things like that and uh they impose a gun control law that would really be disastrous i think because- because_1 i think the criminals will get guns no matter what	3920	A
where if we were restricted from having them_1	3920	A
uh or registering them all so that everybody knows who's got them i i don't feel- i think that would really take away from our	3920	A
our uh rights and freedoms as as citizens to to bear arms and protect ourselves if necessary	3920	A
uh-huh	3920	A
oh my God	3920	A
uh-huh	3920	A
oh boy yeah that i i've read about that that is really tragic i don't know how you could stop that i	3920	A
it that would be terrible	3920	A
i mean you you don't even know whether you want to go to Washington DC	3920	A
with	3920	A
uh-huh	3920	A
no	3920	A
no	3920	A
uh-huh	3920	A
uh-huh	3920	A
uh-huh	3920	A
oh wow	3920	A
yes	3920	A
you would	3920	A
well i know out here uh apparently they've kind of uh uh well they excuse me in the Utah area they have	3920	A
uh the women i guess the women and doctors they had a uh hostage situation at uh one of Alta View Hospital in Salt Lake City where uh a fellow came in with a gun and he uh killed one of the nurses and	3920	A
and held the hostages uh all night till they finally finally got him but	3920	A
uh so what they're saying now in the papers that there has been uh uh big increase in nurses and doctors that are buying guns- hand guns to protect themselves	3920	A
because of this situation that happened and it doesn't happened hasn't happened very often but uh	3920	A
again that's it you hate to to do that but uh	3920	A
we're starting to get some gangs uh they're coming out here and there's been a few shootings drive by shootings and these	3920	A
yeah	3920	A
well it's- it's not bad yet but uh there's there it is happened we we we had one of our uh football coaches at one of our high schools in Salt Lake City that uh	3920	A
i guess they were out on the practice field uh last fall and a couple gangs were involved and they shot him in the leg	3920	A
and uh it's	3920	A
it the police of course are are quite	3920	A
yeah i uh i that's kind of a controversial issue here in the nation's capitol i think we're becoming known as the murder capitol	3920	B
and so there's a lot of of emphasize on gun control	3920	B
uh i'm not exactly sure where i stand because uh	3920	B
i feel that it may be necessary with the crime coming out this way that we'd be allowed to have the facilities- necessary facilities to protect ourselves	3920	B
uh i do know that the District of Columbia has a gun control law and it seems that the number of shootings has gone up since they invoked the law	3920	B
but the the criminals all have guns now	3920	B
uh-huh	3920	B
yeah	3920	B
well we have uh	3920	B
well in Fairfax county it's against the law to discharge a firearm	3920	B
in fact i think it's against the law to discharge a bow and arrow	3920	B
uh	3920	B
but the uh they don't have any real strong gun control law	3920	B
uh whereas just over the border in the District they they have a real strong gun control law	3920	B
Fairfax County is fairly peaceful and uh the District of Columbia is averaging about two murders a day	3920	B
yeah well we- i fortunately- fortunately work out in the suburbs	3920	B
and uh	3920	B
i just don't go downtown at night	3920	B
and uh a little bit reluctant to go in the day time	3920	B
and there've been a few occasions uh i can remember a few years back i was downtown	3920	B
and uh	3920	B
toward quitting time i decided since i was there i'd go visit one of my favorite stores	3920	B
and it was about six thirty when i left the uh store	3920	B
and i was walking back to my car	3920	B
and boy i tell you i got spooked	3920	B
uh there were you know people in the alleys making noises at you and uh	3920	B
people lying around in the park and it was dark and	3920	B
and i i just got scared i wound up running back to the car	3920	B
yeah	3920	B
yeah we've we've had a lot of uh drive-by shootings- we have a few people arrested for it going out and shooting just because they felt like killing somebody	3920	B
just shooting at random i'm kind of sorry to hear that that it's happening in nice rural Utah because_1 uh	3920	B
hm	3920	B
-okay Bill um as you think over the plans and so forth that the company you're working with now who do you work with this time	3985	A
you own the company alright	3985	A
my goodness	3985	A
yeah i guess you do	3985	A
hum	3985	A
well what what do you think of the let's put it this way what do you think are the most important benefits for those working for you other than other than their present salary	3985	A
um-hum	3985	A
a profit sharing plan that's interesting um-hum	3985	A
yes because they they have a specific reason to do so because they themselves benefit from doing a better job	3985	A
um-hum	3985	A
and it's a contribution	3985	A
well Bill uh that idea fits me exactly i just retired from uh the university here and that's been the goal of my life was to	3985	A
contribute and um- to the work that i was doing in my research and that's what made me happy	3985	A
and uh that's the type of goal i think most people ought to look for and i'm sure a lot of them_1 don't you can't stand in front of a counter and	3985	A
do that kind of stuff all day and feel like that you're contributing something to a scientific level of knowledge or so forth	3985	A
you're a financial planning firm how many uh	3985	A
uh-huh	3985	A
um-hum oh	3985	A
well what what changes would you have- have you considered uh in in doing it to your- to your company that might benefit the employees or perhaps the company itself better	3985	A
when you say bring in do you mean that they negotiated with people to to come in and uh ask for your support	3985	A
oh okay um-hum even though they didn't bring it in they help it once it's there	3985	A
yeah	3985	A
um-hum	3985	A
yes but it it might not be necessarily because he did a good or bad job but it might be whether the locality- locality there those people want that kind of support	3985	A
um-hum	3985	A
um-hum	3985	A
um-hum	3985	A
yeah	3985	A
that's true	3985	A
um-hum	3985	A
well i own a company	3985	B
i'm the president and CEO of the company	3985	B
so uh i guess uh i determine what the benefits are	3985	B
but uh you- so what are you asking me what what benefits i think are most important	3985	B
um i'd say in today's economy uh besides basic benefits uh such as um health insurance and life insurance and the uh some type of retirement plan	3985	B
i'd say that uh most of the employees uh um	3985	B
that we have really like a a profit sharing plan	3985	B
they like to participate in the profits of the company like they're part- like you know because they feel like well we're contributing to it so we'd like to participate in it	3985	B
and so that means i make a little bit less but the thing is that really you make a little more because everybody has a interest in in it working	3985	B
right	3985	B
i think most people uh don't want money um it's been my experience most people want uh to feel like they're participating in something that uh	3985	B
that is not a drudgery you know that they can- enjoy and that they can get some benefits out of	3985	B
right	3985	B
yeah well uh our people get a lot of satisfaction um we're a financial planning firm	3985	B
uh yes so you said you retired i just happen to have a person that i happened to do some planning for this morning but anyway uh	3985	B
uh we do we deal with a lot of people that are uh retired or trying to	3985	B
retire	3985	B
and uh it's real important uh that their benefit plans that they get from their companies and from their work that where they were that uh	3985	B
um that it take care of them_1 they don't none of them_1 really want to be rich but they like to have enough to be comfortable	3985	B
well um we considering instead of tying a profit sharing plan to a a salary	3985	B
is uh is tie um	3985	B
uh a percentage	3985	B
um of business that uh that a person would participate and bring into the company	3985	B
uh pay them uh based on the percentage of business they bring instead of based on their salary and the result-	3985	B
no not necessarily um it can be in house people who help you handle X amount of dollars	3985	B
right well see we have different- we have marketing people and then we have uh financial planners	3985	B
and uh then we have uh staff secretaries and administrative assistants	3985	B
and these secretaries and administrative assistants um you know that- if we don't have their cooperation and they're not participating in the profit of the company they they can get very dissatisfied very quickly	3985	B
and so uh we're thinking about paying them instead of a percentage on salary paying them a percentage on the business they handle so	3985	B
administrative assistant that would handle two million dollars worth of business is a lot more valuable than a person that handles a hundred thousand dollars worth of business	3985	B
and uh	3985	B
well and and- and but to see the thing is that they give support to the financial planner that they're the assistant to	3985	B
or that they usually have several people they report to that you know that they work together with	3985	B
uh it encourages them not to uh complain	3985	B
when they realize that they get a part of the of the action based on their efforts not based on being sitting back saying well make me do it	3985	B
see we don't want anybody around here that says make me do it i don't think anybody- any i think most people want to be	3985	B
lack a better terminology- terminology they want to be self employed but they don't want to take the risk in other words they like to control their own future but they also want to be somewhat content to go and come as they please	3985	B
without some real strict adherence which that's what we have	3985	B
oh i've i've gone back and forth on this subject uh many years my husband used to be uh when we were dating he used to really enjoy	3914	B
going out and hunting you know he he grew up learning how to hunt and ah so	3914	B
i had grown up thinking that was an awful thing and then as i learned more about it i realized some of the advantages and the the real	3914	B
reason people most people go out there and hunt and so i kind of got accustomed to the idea	3914	B
but then over the years and when you hear so much about uh what what's actually going on out there it is kind of a	3914	B
a volatile subject and i I tell you at this point in time i cannot give you a a real answer as to how i feel on it i think i I would agree with the	3914	B
with some of the um	3914	B
things the movements out there that are trying to get a a time	3914	B
at least a time restraint on purchasing guns so that you know there's some research that can go on before someone can just walk out with a gun i do feel like that's worthwhile and making sure that that kind of thing goes on	3914	B
but as far as not allowing	3914	B
sales of guns to the public i think that's a little drastic and not realistic because as we all know when there's a ban on anything the people that shouldn't have them_1 still get it anyway so	3914	B
i don't see where that's going to solve anything	3914	B
personally	3914	B
yeah	3914	B
um-hum	3914	B
uh-huh	3914	B
um-hum	3914	B
yeah yeah i have to agree with you there um	3914	B
yeah i think after my husband actually got away from hunting just due to the fact that he was busy	3914	B
working and all he's also kind of lost the the love of going out there and hunting like he once used to in fact i think if he really had the time to get back and	3914	B
in the wilderness i think he'd rather grab a camera now than a the gun and and try	3914	B
yeah and try to capture it that way and because really there's there's no	3914	B
sense of uh the joy of it like he once had but i think that's just you know what he was use to when he was a kid and what they did as a family and compared to now what his priorities are i think	3914	B
um	3914	B
yeah there are some real strong minded people on this issue and	3914	B
yeah yeah	3914	B
yeah	3914	B
yeah that's the problem there are many fools out there that just don't think	3914	B
you know always you know my kids smarter they know about guns it won't happen to them it may not happen to their kid but it'll happen to the neighbor who doesn't understand it and happens to come by and visit	3914	B
or you know that kind of thing	3914	B
unfortunate that there are many people out there that just don't have a lot of common sense and i think that gonna happen	3914	B
oh or or either i'd have to put myself at a five	3914	B
oh yeah yeah oh jeez	3914	B
-okay uh do you have any strong feelings one way or the other about our subject	3914	A
um-hum	3914	A
um-hum	3914	A
well i guess i feel any of the automatic or semi automatic weapons should be	3914	A
uh banned um i'm not quite certain about how i feel about hand guns in that	3914	A
i guess	3914	A
you know it's like do you wanna protect yourself- we don't have a hand gun my husband has an old some kind of a rifle from World War II or something that i don't think he even has any bullets in it but uh	3914	A
hunting weapons don't bother me uh i'm not	3914	A
particularly for hunting i'm not opposed to it you know i'm not a exactly animals rights or anything but i'm personally glad my husband doesn't like to hunt	3914	A
but uh my dad used to hunt and you know he hunted for food basically squirrels and that sort of thing and that that's fine that's fine with me but um i know on the handgun issue	3914	A
that's uh that's one i have a little bit of difficulty with knowing exactly which way but i do think that any of the the semi automatic weapons and all should be not allowed at all	3914	A
um-hum	3914	A
good for him	3914	A
um-hum	3914	A
ah uh to tell you truth i was awfully afraid i was going to get hold of a man that was	3914	A
oh yes The American Rifle Association people and all and uh you know i mean they don't want from what i understand any controls on anything of any sort and	3914	A
uh i just don't think we need free reign you know you hear of the people walking in and	3914	A
shooting well- well not even that so much um	3914	A
the incident that i heard a few weeks ago on the news about this lady whose little boys were in the backseat of the car and she had a semiautomatic weapon and the little boy shot his brother you know what are people doing	3914	A
with with guns like that around little kids i don't understand	3914	A
um-hum	3914	A
um-hum	3914	A
let's see do we need to vote on our one to ten	3914	A
well- one is if you want a total ban and ten is if you is if you want uh no bans on anything	3914	A
well i usually talk until this is over but Leslie i don't-	3914	A
okay uh Utah has a a good school system where uh	3949	A
as far as i'm concerned i can't really	3949	A
see the difficulty uh or any problems that we have other than	3949	A
they keep saying the ACT scores were a little low	3949	A
or lower than well we're above- above the national average but	3949	A
they're talking in the newspapers all the time that we're not doing as well as other countries in science and math	3949	A
which i think there's been an effort to to increase that so	3949	A
i don't see that there's serious- any serious uh problems with our	3949	A
school systems here in Utah	3949	A
uh what about Texas	3949	A
uh-huh	3949	A
yeah	3949	A
well- i hate- i hate to hear it	3949	A
huh	3949	A
where the students are kind of controlling the the schools then in some areas	3949	A
oh boy	3949	A
yeah that's not good uh i'd hate to teach under those situations	3949	A
well well that hasn't got here yet i hope it it doesn't but uh	3949	A
it i know we're we're starting to have a few gangs here	3949	A
associated with the schools	3949	A
yeah	3949	A
but that's where it begins i guess	3949	A
uh-huh	3949	A
but at least uh	3949	A
i i go into the schools quite a bit in my occupation	3949	A
the different high schools in the	3949	A
in the six western states that i	3949	A
i work in	3949	A
and uh	3949	A
generally from what i can see the uh	3949	A
we don't really have that type of problems in any of the states yet	3949	A
but i know talking to my uh counterparts back east that they're	3949	A
they have uh security guards that patrol the hallways and	3949	A
and that's not a good learning situation if you've got to have policemen there to	3949	A
keep kids in class and	3949	A
so it sound like that's it's kind of getting to that point in Texas in at least where you're at	3949	A
yes	3949	A
um-hum	3949	A
that's true and i i think that uh	3949	A
in- in our Utah school systems we	3949	A
we've kind of reversed going from the social classes back to	3949	A
a lot of the academic classes that uh they feel is necessary	3949	A
and i think that is that's a good change to	3949	A
to get back instead of so many uh	3949	A
off the wall classes that have nothing to do with academic education-	3949	A
you know education	3949	A
uh	3949	A
yes there does uh you can't uh	3949	A
go from one extreme to the other and	3949	A
there- there has to be a balance there's got to be both there but i think it should be a little stronger on the academic uh portion	3949	A
in order to prepare them_1 for the society today with the technology that we have they've	3949	A
they've got to have a good math an english background in order to compete	3949	A
no they're talking about uh in some of the states back here are going two hundred days a year instead of a hundred and eighty i don't know what your school year is there but	3949	A
um-hum	3949	A
we have a a there's a little of that going on here but it's all in the elementary grades it's not in the upper uh	3949	A
in the secondary area	3949	A
but i it's there's some test cases to see uh if the students are able to if they don't lose as much uh	3949	A
they're able to retain more where they're only out for a month instead of three months and they have to go	3949	A
uh-huh	3949	A
so it sounds like uh	3949	A
in your area and this area too that they're trying to work on the problem that they see as a problem	3949	A
to correct the some- some- some of the situations uh	3949	A
oh i'd say uh we probably have what could- could be described as serious problems	3949	B
from uh	3949	B
gun toting kids to uh	3949	B
low grades on the teens test	3949	B
they uh	3949	B
they got a pretty much of a handful of	3949	B
problems to deal with	3949	B
well i don't know if you could say that but they're uh	3949	B
are having to uh	3949	B
put in	3949	B
metal detectors and	3949	B
security and	3949	B
indeed	3949	B
yeah that's bad news i tell you they uh	3949	B
course it always sounds a lot worse than it is i suppose but	3949	B
yeah	3949	B
yeah they uh	3949	B
i don't know i think they uh	3949	B
they need to uh	3949	B
get back to the basics i think we	3949	B
throwing a lot of money at the problem but it hasn't uh seemed to	3949	B
do what's necessary yet	3949	B
i think learning social interaction is good too but uh i think it has to be a balanced curriculum	3949	B
that's right	3949	B
yeah i don't think uh American schools in general are uh	3949	B
coming up to where they should be	3949	B
they're talking about going to year- they're actually testing out we just had it on the news tonight about the uh year round school	3949	B
they go for three months and then take a month off or something-	3949	B
um-hum	3949	B
exactly i think that was the uh thing they mentioned too	3949	B
afternoon Doug it certainly is uh going to be a pleasure to chat with you	3979	A
and i'm uh certainly was surprised to uh to hear from you normally i talk to people in Plano Texas	3979	A
how did you get on this list	3979	A
oh okay	3979	A
all righty well now what would you say about these everyday	3979	A
invasions of our privacy do- what ideas do you have on that Doug	3979	A
in what in what manner	3979	A
um-hum	3979	A
well the thing that i thought they were uh concerned about was was people calling- calling on the phone from all over the country to sell you something	3979	A
and in reality in many cases they knew or they had information about you that was purchased from some other	3979	A
organizations and i thought that was uh beginning to invade the privacy of people because	3979	A
the things about where you live and and maybe what you purchased in	3979	A
past months is then put down and sent to someone else in the same business and they in return come back and try to sell you something with this uh	3979	A
additional knowledge to me that's an invasion of privacy	3979	A
uh-huh	3979	A
you mean your history in regards to uh the charge card company or something like that	3979	A
do you consider these serious uh problems	3979	A
um-hum well what should we do about it or what could be done about it do you think to correct it	3979	A
well i would think that uh information held on records uh by any company or charge card dealer or or person should be absolutely private- private and	3979	A
and not be allowed to be uh to given out by those companies	3979	A
i mean it it should be made a a uh national or a state law to protect people so that uh you would then feel more free to deal direct with these companies	3979	A
in other words if you call the company yourself directly uh and then know that what you tell them will be on their records but will not be available to anyone else uh you know from the outside so to speak then you'd	3979	A
you'd feel more free to uh to go into detail with them	3979	A
but but we have no control of that now and then uh you you're when you're talking with them you really don't want to tell them everything that's on your mind because you you feel that it someday might be used against you	3979	A
uh-huh	3979	B
yeah me too	3979	B
uh through Nancy Dalgren she um	3979	B
she had somehow gotten the information from TI and was distributing it around	3979	B
um see i'm not sure that	3979	B
i don't think they're necessarily widespread in this country but i think that the opportunity is definitely there for um	3979	B
people to invade your privacy when they want to i think it's um	3979	B
well it's certainly not that difficult to tap a phone it's completely trivial to for instance	3979	B
listen in on someone's car phone or walk around phone since they're just radio signals it's um	3979	B
and	3979	B
let's see	3979	B
well what's the first thing that comes to your mind	3979	B
uh-huh	3979	B
yeah i agree with you there for sure	3979	B
um	3979	B
and i think that all that information is quite easy for anyone to get you know it's possible for	3979	B
almost anyone to get information about your credit history for instance if they just um	3979	B
twist the right arm or claim to be from the right organization when they're calling the credit company	3979	B
it's you know possible for a thirteen year old	3979	B
hacker with a modem to find out almost anything about your personal history not to mention change it if he wants to	3979	B
well um	3979	B
well yes well for instance yes um and they'll probably goes into	3979	B
other things like you know your records with	3979	B
the government or utility companies or anything	3979	B
since	3979	B
um uh not	3979	B
not yet anyways because i don't think they're widespread enough but i think they have the potential of becoming serious problems	3979	B
um i'm not really sure because	3979	B
the	3979	B
i mean society is going more and more electronic and there are certainly benefits to its doing so	3979	B
and it's hard to hard to say whether the um risks have potential of outweighing the benefits or not	3979	B
and i'm not sure	3979	B
what can be done to ensure that they don't um	3979	B
uh why do you see any out for us	3979	B
uh-huh	3979	B
uh-huh	3979	B
uh-huh	3979	B
yeah i suppose-	3979	B
uh-huh	3979	B
okay we have uh we have a family reunion every every summer and uh we different uh sides of the family take turns on planning it sending out the invitations and	3972	A
and then uh the activities that we have we kind of get together and have a luncheon or a lunch or a a cookout or barbecue or whatever	3972	A
and uh and get to know so all the cousins get to know each other and	3972	A
we really enjoy our our family uh get togethers and family reunions so to speak	3972	A
are you able to do that	3972	A
oh okay	3972	A
oh wow	3972	A
um-hum	3972	A
um-hum	3972	A
well that's really great and uh they're able to come from long distances like that we we have children in Ohio and uh	3972	A
Texas and Germany and Illinois and uh all over but uh	3972	A
they get to some of them_1 but this is uh the ones that live in Utah and but it it's sure great uh those family reunions are really something but	3972	A
at uh	3972	A
it really is because_1 that that really helps and like say to get to know each other and the background and we uh we the one that we have every year uh we go up to uh	3972	A
go up into the canyon and camp out for uh over the weekend and uh it we	3972	A
have a bonfire and uh sit around and in the evening and uh around the pine trees- in the pine trees in the mountains and uh	3972	A
the atmosphere's just really nice and then the kids get to play with each other and it uh it's a super thing uh	3972	A
um-hum	3972	A
uh-huh	3972	A
uh we have uh there's probably about uh	3972	A
our own own family there is we had six children but we have uh my wife's side of the family is the one that we go up to uh	3972	A
Idaho up in the canyon and uh there's probably about uh forty people there	3972	A
and uh total and then we do have another get together at Christmas time on my side of the family and uh this last one we had eighty five people to that one	3972	A
uh we have uh i had five uh four brothers and one sister	3972	A
and then on my wife's side of the family she had uh four sisters and uh a brother	3972	A
and so we're kind of from large families and then they're all married and all have their children and they come and uh so it's it's really quite a get together we've been doing this uh up in Idaho in the summer in the camp out for	3972	A
uh we're thirty nine years every summer we've done this and we do it the second week in July between the Fourth of July and the twenty fourth of July which is a holiday here in Utah	3972	A
it's uh when the pioneers came into Utah and settled uh Utah Brigham Young came in on the twenty fourth of July	3972	A
and when they came across they came from the east in the covered wagons and uh settled- or started the settlement of Salt Lake City	3972	A
so	3972	A
yeah uh they have uh we have uh a large parade in Salt Lake City it's probably the one of the biggest parades in the country it goes for about three or four hours	3972	A
and uh of course uh it's a state holiday	3972	A
and so we uh	3972	A
we have ours between that and uh the week between those the fourth and twenty fourth and	3972	A
so every year we know	3972	A
yes we have ours every three years and uh we have uh relatives in Mexico and Brownsville Texas and Pennsylvania Ohio um	3972	B
West Virginia Virginia and Florida so we've got them everywhere New Jersey and that's why we only have one every three years so that everybody can get together and we uh have one from early morning it starts at eleven	3972	B
and it goes all day and we just had one a year and a half ago we have it every summer in a	3972	B
place called Bare Rocks	3972	B
its a it was a a resort and it was catered and um	3972	B
i hadn't seen cousins that i hadn't seen for years and others that are new in the family from marriage or	3972	B
um-hum	3972	B
aren't they wonderful	3972	B
uh it's a shame that people can't get together like that more often and and uh	3972	B
have a close family tie	3972	B
uh-huh	3972	B
yeah	3972	B
that sounds like fun we only have ours for that one day and uh	3972	B
then we make plans who's going to have the next one where it's going to be and all that and the next one i believe is going to be in New Jersey next year	3972	B
so um	3972	B
do you have a large family	3972	B
uh-huh	3972	B
well that's good how many was in your family	3972	B
uh-huh	3972	B
um-hum	3972	B
what's the holiday	3972	B
oh	3972	B
is there a special uh type of festivities for that occasion too	3972	B
um	3972	B
well Liz what sort of things have you had to return lately because of poor quality	3948	A
um-hum	3948	A
yeah	3948	A
well i had an interesting experience with a sweater at Christmas time my mother got me two turtleneck sweaters	3948	A
one red one and one black one and i wore the red one and it was fine and i got i was in a hurry one morning to go to work i threw on the black sweater with this suit and i wasn't paying attention i was stuck in a meeting all day with a	3948	A
zipper- zipper that was gouging me in the back and the sleeves were too short	3948	A
and i was in this meeting all day long	3948	A
yes it was	3948	A
yes same make same size same style everything	3948	A
yes as a matter of fact i took it back Saturday to Dillard's my mother bought it at Dillard's in Las Cruces New Mexico	3948	A
and i took it to the local Dillard's and said that you know there's something wrong with this sweater these sleeves are definitely two inches shorter	3948	A
i'm very tall and have long arms so sleeve length is critical	3948	A
yes	3948	A
yes	3948	A
oh	3948	A
yeah	3948	A
oh i think some things are clothing definitely	3948	A
it seems like you have to pay an awful lot to get decent clothing	3948	A
and but then other things like oh	3948	A
yes	3948	A
yes but i think anytime you get into high style items things that change all the time that uh	3948	A
think it gets	3948	A
it's tougher for them to maintain the quality	3948	A
course if you listen to the the Japanese politicians we're going in the ditch for quality and productivity and everything else	3948	A
um	3948	A
wow	3948	A
so did you buy the same brand the next time	3948	A
yeah	3948	A
well i was just thinking about that i really haven't uh	3948	B
i haven't had to take anything back that there was poor quality i took something back that that wasn't quite what i thought it was	3948	B
uh you know some uh some it- i had even called my brother this was a uh back when the winter- uh you know when the winter was so bad and uh i wanted a vaporizer and uh	3948	B
i had the right brand and it said a lot of the right things on it but then it wasn't exactly the right one i had to take that back but there was nothing wrong with it	3948	B
have you had much trouble with products	3948	B
uh-huh	3948	B
oh yuck	3948	B
oh how awful and uncomfortable	3948	B
and they were both the same make and everything	3948	B
oh that is frustrating did they take it back	3948	B
uh-huh	3948	B
yeah and	3948	B
and they were willing to take it back	3948	B
yeah oh well you know now that you mention that i was thinking of how- of more of you know kitchen kind of products or or whatever	3948	B
and- and i i uh bought the silk shirts that The Limited had and i just loved them_1	3948	B
and and i bought one out of town and you know at the time i just said could i return it someplace else you know at another Limited they said yes and the silk comes- comes i mean i it's i am finding it amazing that you can just put	3948	B
in- you know in the facing in the uh	3948	B
for the	3948	B
so i i took it back and they just without question let me get another one and now this other one's doing it too and i think what they're doing is not using enough material right there at that seam so that you know it just pulls apart	3948	B
but i'm not sure that i think i don't know do you think things are	3948	B
worse quality now than they used to be or	3948	B
uh-huh	3948	B
yeah	3948	B
yeah	3948	B
seem- seem to not just sort of be unchanging yeah yeah	3948	B
um-hum um-hum	3948	B
yeah well course uh stuff comes from all over too so uh and i was just thinking about that of of the things that i've that i've uh bought recently	3948	B
i'd i'm a little worried about those long items i just had to buy a new washing machine and uh the one i had was twenty	3948	B
one twenty two years old no-	3948	B
no no no no it was more like twenty four years old and just had just gone on beautifully the whole time till the end it finally gave up and i had to	3948	B
i think maybe repaired once in all those years you know so-	3948	B
well i did- so i mean obviously that's what you think about doing it was a it was a Kenmore and um i so i thought about that and then went and found out you- well you know these	3948	B
this company and this company's bought and all the companies- all the washing machines are made by the same company something like that with different names	3948	B
and i said well no way you what do you mean they're all i mean the- why would they make them why would they make different ones in different names it's the same company making them	3948	B
i i found that very upsetting and then it made me think about all the things that have been lasting my refrigerator	3948	B
the dryer the dryer's still going	3948	B
well i think one of the major changes is the whole attitude towards women in the work place and the role of women in doing jobs outside of the home	3908	B
that's probably even one of the major changes i see over the last period of time	3908	B
oh i don't think so i think it's come a long ways in terms of giving them equal opportunities but i still think in lots of job markets they're not treated as equals in the words in some in some respects the other direction that in some job markets they really don't wanna be treated as equals	3908	B
yes i think that's generally speaking pretty true and i think that's what we really ought to look at that going is if they're gonna do equal work they ought to get equal pay	3908	B
and that uh they ought to have equal opportunities to advance to those positions and i don't think we've gotten there yet	3908	B
oh boy	3908	B
i think it's generally that switch over and i and i think that switch over has been more in the work force i don't think that women are treated as equals in the home as much as they are in the work force	3908	B
i think those women who are out working are probably still expected to carry more responsibility at home that the husband's having them on the other side of that coin picked up as much responsibility at home so they have one and three quarters jobs now	3908	B
whereas the husbands have one and a quarter	3908	B
yeah	3908	B
yes yeah and i think also in terms of parenting i think there's gonna be some increasing problem because_1 i think women are expecting husbands to do more parenting and i'm not sure they're becoming any more skilled at it	3908	B
because_1 i think it really has put some additional- additional stresses on family units	3908	B
well i- i think one of the things that always happens is i think we'll swing to one end whereas you know where were moving at to the end where a lot of women will be at work	3908	B
and then i think we starting to see now some tendency of women at mid thirties and so i was saying you know this career thing isn't all it's cracked up to be and i wanna go back and do something else so i think we'll probably see this swing pendulum in terms of the work force swing back a little bit	3908	B
although so much of it's driven by economics right now people have gotten out and gotten use to two incomes coming in	3908	B
yeah	3908	B
well i think they ought to have the right i- i have some problems with my own family thinking about my wife going to combat- and or my wife or my daughter's going into combat but i have problems with men doing that and i guess if they want to they ought to have the right to do it it's nothing i'd be greatly enthusiastic about pushing for	3908	B
i agree	3908	B
well i think one of the other things that concern has concerned me a little bit and i think i see some change in attitudes there my wife happens to be a wife who's chosen to stay at home	3908	B
and there's a a tendency- has been a tendency over the past few years to treat her as though she was somebody who didn't have much intelligence because if she did she'd be out in the work force uh and fulfilling herself	3908	B
and i hope we reach the point where whatever women- women chose to do that's acceptable if they chose to go into the work force that's okay if they choose not to that's acceptable	3908	B
as equals	3908	B
Allen	3908	A
uh the question is concerning the changes in the roles of American women in the past several generations and you know the in their in the society we live in what do you think has occurred there	3908	A
um-hum but uh are are they being given the full uh honor for the work they're doing and for the um	3908	A
oh my gosh can't think of the word but for the what they have to accept well that's that they're responsible for it absolutely- responsibilities is what i'm trying to say	3908	A
uh-huh	3908	A
by the same token most in in most cases women have the jobs with the same responsibility of men who been there before but at lower- lower salaries is- is that right wrong	3908	A
is that	3908	A
yes	3908	A
um-hum	3908	A
yeah what changes do you think are most significant over the past few years	3908	A
any individual thing or is it just a general switch over	3908	A
um-hum	3908	A
i have a feeling that business with a woman working out at the same level of responsibility as their husband	3908	A
sort of tears into their social or their loving relationship in that uh	3908	A
the the lady	3908	A
stand- wants to stand up for what she has made and her own rights and has every right to do so and this upsets the man because uh we've always been built to think that we were sort of head of the household	3908	A
so do you think that is gonna be uh difficult saying as far as uh marriages and people enjoying each other in the future years	3908	A
um-hum	3908	A
well do you have any opinion of potential changes that may occur- occur in the next generation specifically	3908	A
um-hum	3908	A
um-hum	3908	A
yes	3908	A
well i actually most- lot of women are being hired now instead of men because they can be brought in at lower salaries because that's what everybody else assumes they're gonna get	3908	A
and the people well how do you feel about women in uh armed services	3908	A
yeah	3908	A
um	3908	A
yeah i somehow can't do that i well- i was brought up in the ages when the ladies were kept home safe secure and made happy and the men went out and took the responsibility of earning the money	3908	A
bringing in whatever they needed and and protecting the household and it and it really still bothers me and i spent plenty of years in the service	3908	A
but it still bothers me to see ladies out in combat or actually out in places where there's two or three of them_1 there and five hundred men around them_1 and how are they gonna protect themselves so to speak	3908	A
it puts them in a very bad situation i i i really don't go for that	3908	A
um-hum	3908	A
yep	3908	A
well that's not fair because i tell- i can tell you one thing stay home sometime and start uh	3908	A
yeah	3908	A
yeah	3908	A
and if they go in the work force they should be treated as nicely as as well as a man or any other person and uh not	3908	A
so you have a son	3911	B
uh-huh	3911	B
um-hum	3911	B
um-hum uh-huh	3911	B
yeah	3911	B
i would think so when you when when your son was at home did you um working did you work or were you able to stay at home with him	3911	B
uh-huh	3911	B
yeah well when my mom uh when i was growing up my mom worked too but she worked nights	3911	B
and uh as a nurse and so she was always home for us	3911	B
and i always i really appreciated that having her there when i was you know when i came home from school and when i worked	3911	B
yeah	3911	B
um	3911	B
yeah	3911	B
they really do uh a family without a father is it's a it's a really hard thing	3911	B
uh-huh	3911	B
kids i think would much rather have dad there than the toy anyway	3911	B
oh yeah oh yeah our uh-huh but we're um we just got married like like December so we're going to wait a year and then we will try	3911	B
uh-huh	3911	B
yeah that's a possibility yeah well we really want to have a family we feel like that that couple you know	3911	B
you're not giving enough of yourself and you should you should be sharing your family	3911	B
and giving your values to you know making something better of of the world by raising up good kids and letting them know they're loved and stuff give them give them an edge but	3911	B
we feel like like the first year needs to be devoted to uh making the the family the couple strong and secure in their love for each other	3911	B
but then a family is is definitely a high priority	3911	B
well i um i'm in a different situation i am a missionary	3911	B
and i'm home on on furlough it's called like i've worked for four years in Africa and i come home for a year	3911	B
and then we go back for four years but my husband and i will do the same job and we'll be living in in Africa and we'll be working together	3911	B
so uh we will we will share the job of raising the family i mean as a mother i'll have certain responsibilities that he might not necessarily have but still we'll share that job	3911	B
but we have then we have decisions that we have to make that are hard about schooling like do you want to home school your kids on a computer program	3911	B
you know that kind of thing	3911	B
or do you send them away to boarding school and if you do that when do you do it and that's a	3911	B
um	3911	A
i have a an older son yeah he doesn't have any children yet though	3911	A
uh he's thirty seven and i don't know if he's ever going to have any or not but i do have some neighbor kids lots of little neighbor kids	3911	A
that i go out and uh i play ball with them	3911	A
you know it's because like this one that lives right next door her mother does some work at home on computers and it just seems like she doesn't have any time for them_1	3911	A
which is kind of sad you know	3911	A
so the kids are kind of hungry for someone to play with them so i will go out and play catch with them or you know we have- let the dogs outside and they will roll around on the ground and play with the dogs	3911	A
but uh actually i do think that the parents should have you know a little bit more time to spend with their kids	3911	A
no when my son was at home i i did work and then he went to a baby sitter that this lady had about uh five other kids that she baby sat	3911	A
you know but we always had our days off together and we went camping on vacations so we had a lot of time together that way you know	3911	A
uh-huh	3911	A
uh-huh	3911	A
oh yeah well i am sure it was you know but uh	3911	A
i don't know what the families are really going to come to nowadays because they just there just doesn't seem like they do have time for their kids because most most of them the father and the mother both work	3911	A
you know	3911	A
so it's really rough um i have one neighbor that's uh the father is a fireman	3911	A
and he works like four days on and it seems like he is suppose to come home for like three or four days	3911	A
but he can't make enough as a fireman to support his family you know so he's got a second job	3911	A
so he's you know he's not home very often	3911	A
and that's you know the kids i know miss that you know	3911	A
yeah you know and i don't know i i suppose they are trying to get through to them that well daddy is not home because	3911	A
you know he is out working trying to make some money for you know we can buy you this bike and that toy and so forth you know	3911	A
but uh	3911	A
oh i'm sure they would you know	3911	A
so are you planning on to having any children or	3911	A
um-hum	3911	A
um yeah well that's good yeah that's	3911	A
that's what my uh daughter-in-law had told me that they were going to have kids	3911	A
probably after two years of marriage	3911	A
and they will be married nine years this year	3911	A
so i don't know she's a nurse you know and uh she has brothers and sisters that has got lots of little kids so maybe they just decided that uh	3911	A
if they wanted to have kids around the house they would just you know call one of their sisters or brothers up and tell them to send the kids over for the night	3911	A
you know but uh	3911	A
uh-huh	3911	A
uh-huh so	3911	A
right	3911	A
right right	3911	A
uh-huh	3911	A
right right	3911	A
yeah uh do you plan on staying home after you have your children or do you do you work or what	3911	A
uh-huh	3911	A
um-hum um-hum	3911	A
um-hum	3911	A
um-hum um-hum	3911	A
um-hum	3911	A
um-hum	3911	A
okay yeah the topic is uh car repairs and the last one i've had done it was a fluke the last one i had done	3976	B
well i was driving down six thirty five at the um coming from North Dallas	3976	B
and i was uh going um almost hitting the um	3976	B
entry where all the the merges go from six thirty five seventy five and Coit and uh all of a sudden i get this liquid all over my hood and my windshield	3976	B
and i had smelled it before i thought and i thought	3976	B
that it was coming from another vehicle	3976	B
and then when i saw it go all over my car i thought oh oh something	3976	B
came through my radiator and just	3976	B
something's wrong inside my car so i- i was waiting for my car to collapse you know i go i was going about sixty five miles an hour	3976	B
and it kept going and i thought well what is going on	3976	B
and so i made it home and i looked at my car and it was a mess	3976	B
so i immediately the next morning i took it to my dealer	3976	B
and i i left it just how i drove it in the the night before and he says well it looks like your uh antifreeze	3976	B
uh something happened to your antifreeze	3976	B
and they checked everything in that car and it wasn't from my car	3976	B
it was from some other car some other car did that to me well i'm glad but it was a very panicky situation	3976	B
but no i do not do any of my own repairs the only thing i do to my car is put gas in it and wash it	3976	B
oh you do well good for you	3976	B
that's great	3976	B
oh i see oh well he probably showed you all the tricks of the trade that's great	3976	B
sure	3976	B
you did well bless your heart	3976	B
well i think that's wonderful i mean i think that's great	3976	B
well gee you should uh you know you should get some money for your talents and start branching out	3976	B
it is	3976	B
oh well you know uh loosening those nuts and bolts would be a problem for me	3976	B
and i know they have some really sophisticated equipment today where they do it electronically and all that but that takes money to buy those kind of tools too	3976	B
um-hum	3976	B
um-hum	3976	B
right yeah no i wouldn't want	3976	B
my- i wouldn't want anybody to touch my car without having all the the yeah the uh computer and all and everything	3976	B
because you have that uh as a as a gift to you don't you that they do it for you for gratis	3976	B
uh-huh right	3976	B
well i have a woman's agreement on mine and they they did it for three years	3976	B
yeah yeah that really was nice so i uh appreciated that uh	3976	B
a present that they gave me	3976	B
oh	3976	B
um-hum	3976	B
right	3976	B
well don't they have if you that they hook it up to the computer and the computer does the analysis and tells you what's wrong with with different areas yeah yeah	3976	B
um-hum	3976	B
well i i have put windshield washer solvent in the container but and	3976	B
no i have not this one hasn't needed any thus thus far	3976	B
um it's been a super car it's uh let's see it's uh three years old	3976	B
it's it's a Plymouth Acclaim	3976	B
i really like it it's a been a very dependable um	3976	B
no maintenance i have not had-	3976	B
right	3976	A
uh-huh	3976	A
what happened	3976	A
uh-huh	3976	A
yeah	3976	A
huh	3976	A
some other car had too-	3976	A
well isn't that something well oh sure	3976	A
right	3976	A
well i do i do some of my own repairs yes i do i i have learned to do this	3976	A
that uh my husband drives uh sports cars races- he races them_1 as a hobby	3976	A
yes and he said you need to know how to do all this stuff so i do change my own oil um	3976	A
most in fact i have changed out a whole engine in uh one of sons' trucks	3976	A
but uh	3976	A
but now if i could talk him into doing this i'll let him do it i've told him i've learned how but	3976	A
no i don't think i wanna work on too many people's cars that's hard work i think they earn their money i do	3976	A
right	3976	A
yes it does now i- i don't think i will be able to work on you know too many- cars much longer because they are sophisticated and i just can't fool with these computers and things that they have in it that	3976	A
the proper tools right that's	3976	A
but it uh	3976	A
i had just gotten a new car this year and i- i take it back to the dealer- i take this one to the dealer	3976	A
yes right uh-huh at least this first year and uh	3976	A
oh well that's nice	3976	A
uh-huh well that that is really good but i can't think of any offhand um problems we have really had lately you know that we've had to fix	3976	A
uh the one thing we have problem with is our electricals anything that goes electrical wrong with the cars we don't even try to fool with those ourselves	3976	A
and uh those	3976	A
to me they're very difficult to locate the problem if you	3976	A
well right they can do that with the new ones uh-huh with these newer cars you can do that and uh	3976	A
but other than that the	3976	A
the oil changes and the gases	3976	A
yeah have you ever changed a windshield wiper	3976	A
yeah yeah	3976	A
oh well good what kind is it	3976	A
uh-huh well good	3976	A
okay what are you are you doing anything in Utah on recycling	3937	B
um-hum	3937	B
is it a small town	3937	B
that makes a difference uh here in Dallas they're trying to	3937	B
to start some curbside recycling i think they're doing a test uh personally my husband and i do plastic and glass and newspaper and cans but we have to uh take them you know to	3937	B
to areas and the problem that i'm finding is that uh a lot of the places i've been taking things have now discontinued the recycling policy like it's hard to find a place to take newspapers anymore	3937	B
oh really	3937	B
well i noticed a difference uh we go to the Kroger store uh here to take our aluminum cans and i noticed a difference you know i'd be getting perhaps a dollar for whatever i took in and i think the last bunch i took in which i didn't think was much smaller was maybe twenty six cents	3937	B
um-hum	3937	B
well you know what is so sad is that people are finally i think willing to do something about this and then all of a sudden uh the the demand isn't there you know it's too expensive to recycle but i personally feel that we're going to have to	3937	B
pay the price you know whether the government subsidizes it and i'm you know i sorry to the government- government get involved in too much of anything else like that but something has to be done we're just uh we're using our natural resources we're filling up the dumps and	3937	B
um-hum	3937	B
uh-huh	3937	B
well and i know uh too my mother lives in a rural area also and it she would have to go like thirty miles to recycle anything and so- course- so of course she- she doesn't and plus uh it's difficult for her to	3937	B
drive around just all that much so in a case like that you know they have to make it a little bit easier for people	3937	B
to do that	3937	B
and i take my uh paper i always get paper bags and i take them back to the grocery store and use them again	3937	B
so you know little bit here and little bit there i guess it all helps	3937	B
not a lot but i've heard the name Provo before	3937	B
okay	3937	B
um-hum	3937	B
well in uh our particular area uh we're not other than uh	3937	A
they have a local store that you can take uh	3937	A
bottles and	3937	A
cans and different things to	3937	A
in their parking lot and uh	3937	A
in the winter we haven't been doing that but uh	3937	A
they don't uh	3937	A
that's about all they're doing	3937	A
yes it's a rural area	3937	A
uh-huh	3937	A
um-hum yes so that's uh that's basically what happened up here and then uh with all the recycling the price of aluminum cans went down	3937	A
yeah it used to be about sixty cents a pound and so people were collecting them and taking them in to recycle-	3937	A
uh to get money for them now it's down to about nineteen cents a pound	3937	A
yeah that's that's what's happened and i don't know if that's from recycling i i understand it is but	3937	A
here uh we do- we do recycle our newspapers and give them_1 to the scouts	3937	A
and they uh they're able to make some money	3937	A
uh	3937	A
that way	3937	A
but i have a son in Illinois who uh	3937	A
they pick it up they have a a recycling uh garbage uh pick up where they have different	3937	A
uh receptacles where they put it in	3937	A
they have some for the cans some for the bottles and newspapers	3937	A
and then they have the regular garbage and uh	3937	A
this truck comes before the garbage truck and picks uh	3937	A
and has separate bins to put all the glass and the plastic and all that in	3937	A
that seems to be working quite well there that's uh in uh Illinois	3937	A
yes	3937	A
uh-huh	3937	A
yeah	3937	A
um-hum	3937	A
well i've that's what they in the local- the local paper here they were talking about that uh half about half the uh	3937	A
the material in the dumps is newspapers	3937	A
they could recycle that uh more than they do then uh	3937	A
um	3937	A
we'd be able to save a lot of trees and everything else so i've been i i i'm all for it i just don't know uh	3937	A
i know my son uh in Chicago where he has this they have uh	3937	A
uh they have to pay extra to have them pick it up even though and and so that's kind of a a burden on my uh	3937	A
my son even though they they put it in different containers they still have to pay extra money to do	3937	A
and uh	3937	A
um	3937	A
yes they do	3937	A
yeah um-hum	3937	A
right	3937	A
yep boy that's true	3937	A
hm right	3937	A
yeah	3937	A
yeah it- it really does if we could just get uh people uh	3937	A
all over to do it now i know in uh south of us about a hundred miles south in Utah they do have a uh area where	3937	A
uh they bring all the garbage in and they uh they do have places to recycle and they really encourage this and uh you can bring it and you have different areas	3937	A
um that's a small- yeah- well it's next to Provo Utah i don't know if you're familiar with Utah at all but anyway-	3937	A
it's where Brigham- Brigham Young University is uh this	3937	A
uh there they seem to be having success and but it is a uh	3937	A
it's done by the	3937	A
it for profit making for these people	3937	A
and they of course are	3937	A
hey	3934	A

i like it a lot	3934	A
i love it up here i like it better than Dallas	3934	A

i oh i live in Dallas yep but i had- i'm out of breath because_1 i had to run to find my card because_1 i didn't remember my PIN i haven't done this in a while it's been probably three- three or four months i think	3934	B
yeah well we we we got on it um a long time ago but then it was down so much of the time you kind of got out of the out of the habit	3934	B
so anyway so what are we supposed to talk about	3934	B
okay- okay so what- so what magazines do you take	3934	B
yes	3934	B
well now if you don't take any magazines why would you why would you want to talk about magazines	3934	B
i subscribe to lots of magazines yes my family well- well we're we're kind of renowned for being big magazine subscribers	3934	B
well because i- i- i have a lot of interests and and the magazines have a lot of interesting articles and	3934	B
well let's see i get a magazine called The Economist get the Atlantic Monthly i get Harpers um we get Newsweek um	3934	B
i get um magazine called Fine Woodworking um what else do we get here	3934	B
um let's see then i get a bunch of magazines at the office like Fortune and Forbes i also- oh i get the New Republic here at the house as well i read Business Week um	3934	B
so i don't know we i'd probably some and sometimes i take them_1 for a while and then sometimes i- i you know i'll let them_1 lapse and then i'll get something new	3934	B
uh-huh	3934	B
yeah	3934	B
yeah	3934	B
do you are are you in school out at at- out at Tech really which year are you in out there	3934	B

uh-huh	3934	B
oh	3934	B
okay	3934	B
yeah well it's not too hard but i i've called in a couple times but then like i said it was down so much that i got out of the habit and then i'm not usually home so i'm not usually here when when- when- when they try because_1 i don't i haven't done it very often	3934	B
but didn't you have to fill out a form where it said that you would check off magazines and stuff on it	3934	B
well now what magazines do you like to read	3934	B
well if you had a hundred bucks and you couldn't do anything except spend them on magazines what magazines would you would you get- would you would you buy	3934	B
oh really	3934	B
those magazines are like phone books aren't they they're like two thousand pages of advertising- uh uh of ads or something in them_1	3934	B
really really	3934	B
really	3934	B
really that's neat	3934	B
there so did you did you uh um uh uh ride them_1 and stuff what do they call it Dursege and	3934	B
um-hum well that's good	3934	B
uh-huh	3934	B
um-hum um-hum my	3934	B
well you could buy an awful lot of Bride magazines for a hundred dollars i don't know it- it-	3934	B
we have some newsstands here in Dallas you know that have like thousands of magazines and i could buy a lot i could buy a lot of magazines	3934	B
well there's more that i could get	3934	B
um-hum well they have a lot of they i don't know they have a lot of different different kinds of ads and stuff in them_1	3934	B
yeah	3934	B
i guess- so what are you majoring in out there	3934	B
really	3934	B
that's good	3934	B
you- you you like Lubbock better than Dallas why	3934	B
really well people are nice here in Dallas	3934	B
you don't think so huh	3934	B
where'd you go to high school	3934	B
oh my son goes to Richardson High School	3934	B
all right	3932	A
yeah i think so i i don't know well i'm not one in finances first of all and but i do try- try to keep a family budget what about you	3932	A
well that's the way with us that's why i said i try to keep one with my husband isn't working and uh yeah and and it makes it real tough you're right	3932	A
well i rob Peter to pay Paul i pay the utilities and the most expensive- uh biggest bills at the first of the month	3932	A
and then i look buy the groceries and the smaller bills like- like middle of the month but i have it {exed} out to last me for the whole month	3932	A
and he works contract work occasionally so that helps he's an electronics engineer an electronics engineer	3932	A
and uh he works mainly on aircraft and he was working with Eastern and Eastern uh went bankrupt	3932	A
so yeah so um	3932	A
he- he- he- he said he	3932	A
yeah	3932	A
that's true	3932	A
what kind of work do you do	3932	A
oh uh-huh	3932	A
that makes it really hard too	3932	A
do you ever try to hit a long shot like in lottery or races or anything like that	3932	A
have it to do it right hm yeah	3932	A
Publisher's- Publisher's Warehouse i never send those either but i thought well maybe you do have a chance after all	3932	A
but um	3932	A
um-hum	3932	A
um	3932	A
yes we do	3932	A
yes	3932	A
harder	3932	A
yeah well when we bought the economy- the uh real estate was really high and now with the last appraisal we got and everything it really went down so that if if we would've tried to go on a market we'd have lost money	3932	A
uh-huh	3932	A
um-hum	3932	A
i'm trying to hang in there	3932	A
does your where -does your wife work	3932	A
oh	3932	A
yeah	3932	A
do you just go commercial-	3932	A
it's going to be a hard one huh why	3932	B
uh-huh	3932	B
um you know it's it's	3932	B
oh is that right that makes it real tough	3932	B
huh so how do you how do you make ends meet and how do you make sure that your bills are paid and	3932	B
yeah	3932	B
uh-huh	3932	B
huh	3932	B
what does he do	3932	B
a what	3932	B
uh-huh	3932	B
oh is that right	3932	B
well that's tough yeah especially these days when uh the economy is so bad yeah i work on commission and um	3932	B
and that makes it tough too because i you know you can't you can't always budget what you you know you can't have the same budget every month because uh you know uh	3932	B
uh i am in the roofing business commercial roofing business	3932	B
and so you know i may do real well this month but uh next month it may you know may not rain at all and we not have any work so	3932	B
it makes it really hard to to set any budget and uh you know	3932	B
so um i guess it's uh	3932	B
it- you know each family has their own own way of doing it i- i do it about the same way you do you know we pay what what needs to be paid	3932	B
so that we don't you know we don't have the lights turned off or have the electric- water turned off or the phone turned off	3932	B
and-	3932	B
no i don't um mostly- mostly- mostly- mostly because we don't uh yeah so how about you	3932	B
uh-huh	3932	B
yeah	3932	B
huh no i uh you know most of the uh most of the financial uh	3932	B
problems that we have you know are- are things that we kind of brought on ourselves because we kind of overextended ourselves of couple of you know few years ago with uh	3932	B
credit cards and stuff and then the economy went bad and you know i was out of work for a couple- you know for little while	3932	B
and uh you know been on commissions for- for you know few years and it's just um	3932	B
we just never got caught up so do you own your own home	3932	B
yeah well we do too and that makes it even tougher because you know we tried to put our house up for sale and-	3932	B
and uh the economy's so bad we couldn't sell it	3932	B
yeah well we did too	3932	B
yeah well we got we you know all we asked out of our house was the the note	3932	B
and um shoot uh somebody came and and offered us we would've lost twenty thousand dollars on our home	3932	B
you know if we were just to sell it	3932	B
and uh so we decided to keep it and kind of just	3932	B
uh	3932	B
yeah try to make things uh work	3932	B
she doesn't i mean she does- actually she does she actually probably works more than i do but she does sewing and hair and stuff at home	3932	B
and um so the only you know i guess bright uh	3932	B
uh thing that we have to look forward to is that i own part of the company that that uh i work for and and so that's kind of helping us out you know it's making things a little more um	3932	B
little easier because i can always count on a check on Friday	3932	B
well i we're sort of in the middle of it um	3916	B
last February we brought my mother from Florida to us here in Texas and so far she has been with us but	3916	B
i really look to the future that it may be occurring um i don't know what i'll do i i'm almost inclined to hire somebody um to be in our home with her rather than have to	3916	B
put her somewhere you know but	3916	B
well i think partly and it's not me it's the it seems to me the older generation my mother and father and- my in-laws	3916	B
um you know the stigma used to be you went there and and you died and so they have all kind of	3916	B
right	3916	B
you know it just um	3916	B
and you try and say you know they're nice now or or nicer and	3916	B
you know i wouldn't want her in one in Florida because_1 i couldn't check on her but if she were in one near here i- i would probably be there	3916	B
you know several times per week and i would	3916	B
stand up and scream if i saw things that were you know improper or or uh you know her care was not	3916	B
have you had that experience yet	3916	B
well	3916	B
oh	3916	B
right	3916	B
it's uh well my father died several years ago and that was you know he had cancer and	3916	B
eventually the hospital comes and says you know your father uh care- you know Medicare says he doesn't need the level of care to be hospitalized so you are going to	3916	B
eventually they'll come and tell you you will have two days to you know move him somewhere else and and that my mother and i needed to think what do we want to do at that point we did because he was	3916	B
not yet comatose but real close and he lived two weeks in the nursing home so we did do that but um at at that time three and a half years ago my mother was in such a	3916	B
state of depression i didn't think she could handle even if we had full time around the clock care i didn't think	3916	B
emotionally she could handle him being there it well it yes that too you you know there is no question that uh	3916	B
just moving them about is um difficult but it really is and it's just uh and i have friends whose we're all in the age group where	3916	B
were thinking about some of these things for our parents and it really is uh	3916	B
with	3916	B
well of course this again was in Florida actually the level of care and in fact two that we looked at were you know they were all in mauve and blue and very elegant looking and	3916	B
and so on but i didn't like the fact that they had you know eight patients for one uh you know nurse or one care giver and the one we selected was not nearly as	3916	B
uh up to date however it was clean and the patients were well cared for and i like it because it had like a level of five to one and i felt that that would be	3916	B
better care for my father uh and but several of her neighbors and friends oh but you ought to i said i know but	3916	B
we're making this decision and my mom basically let me make the decision so	3916	B
um and she was pleased with it because he did get um	3916	B
you know just wonderful care	3916	B
oh absolutely i don't care what you know one of these had a little ice cream parlor and i looked at the manager i said my father you know will never get out of a bed i don't care about a ice cream parlor	3916	B
you know if you went there and you were in your seventies and well you just went there	3916	B
to a you know retirement center yes you could do all that good stuff but this was	3916	B
i wanted him cared for and and not left uh you know if he spoiled his linens or something i did not want that	3916	B
you know there what do you do in a hospital work with okay all right	3916	B
right	3916	B
to face the situation where you were looking at putting a loved one in the nursing home	3916	A
really	3916	A
um-hum um-hum	3916	A
uh-huh	3916	A
you don't feel as though that that's a decision you're comfortable with because	3916	A
you'd be	3916	A
you feel as though they are being abandoned if you leave them somewhere	3916	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3916	A
sure	3916	A
um-hum um-hum	3916	A
it's difficult boy i really	3916	A
can appreciate	3916	A
no i haven't but um	3916	A
i- i work in a hospital and we see patients	3916	A
whose families are just not able to care for them once they've left the hospital and so they have to make that decision often when the patient's still in the hospital	3916	A
uh-huh	3916	A
so then you begin right	3916	A
um-hum um-hum	3916	A
yes	3916	A
yes it's a challenging job physically	3916	A
um-hum	3916	A
yes	3916	A
yes	3916	A
what are some of the things that you have looked for for example with your father what- what helped you identify an appropriate	3916	A
placement was it was it geographic was it how close it was to you or	3916	A
oh that's right	3916	A
care giver uh-huh	3916	A
yes	3916	A
um-hum	3916	A
um-hum	3916	A
that's a pretty important factor too that really influences the degree	3916	A
more a transitional setting	3916	A
uh-huh	3916	A
exactly	3916	A
my job is as occupational therapist um	3916	A
a lot of what we are looking at are are skills that the person is gonna have to be able to perform to be able to live independently once they leave the hospital and we sometimes help the family make that decision if it looks like they're gonna be able to	3916	A
get in and out of bed or on and off the toilet with just a little bit of help then that's something that they can manage but	3916	A
you you're talking about an elderly spouse and when it involves quite a bit of assistance and lifting you don't want the other person	3916	A
i'm Brigette	3931	A
nice to meet you	3931	A
i live in Lubbock	3931	A
oh do you	3931	A

a lot he wears me out	3931	A
um	3931	A
my boyfriend really talked about it and he was like i'm going to get you one i was like you are not well he did	3931	A
so it's kind of i guess our dog	3931	A

yeah	3931	A
really	3931	A
uh-huh	3931	A
yeah- i've i would- i don't know i would prefer a cat over a dog i think	3931	A
just because_1 it- i mean this dog is a lot of work	3931	A
uh-huh	3931	A
yep	3931	A
i know i wouldn't either we're complaining but i would never give mine up either	3931	A

oh okay	3931	B
do you live in the country	3931	B
oh	3931	B

yeah we used to i grew up where i grew up we had collies and i lived in the country we had cattle and	3931	B
but my husband's a hunter so we now have a hunting dog it's um an English Springer Spaniel	3931	B
and she's a water dog and um she's a uh flusher she's not a retriever but	3931	B
she spends most of her time in the house she's pretty spoiled	3931	B

yeah we have a cat too just an old farm cat she's a gray black tabby	3931	B
and she's going to be thirteen years old here in April	3931	B

oh	3931	B
yeah	3931	B
i know it that's nice to have something to come home to when my husband moved down here he moved here a couple months before us because we had to get you know the house sold and everything and he was so lonely	3931	B
because he you know we lived- we were twelve hours away that we almost sent the cat with him because_1 that way he would have something to come home to	3931	B
he was in a little apartment you know and got real lonesome so i think that's nice to have animals i think they make you feel like you're loved and	3931	B
ooh yes	3931	B
well that's a good idea	3931	B
oh	3931	B
what kind of a cat do you have at home	3931	B
hm	3931	B
those are nice they're so pretty	3931	B
that's right cats are my first choice too	3931	B
i have always had one ever since i was little	3931	B
and they've always just been you know nothing special but jeez i've had all colors and long hair short hair and no hair and	3931	B
yeah	3931	B
they are and you have to let them_1 in and out and and if you go somewhere you have to have someone take care of them_1 and	3931	B
not that i would ever give her up but	3931	B
oh but if i get another kitty i decided i wanted to get a Maine Coon cat have you ever seen those	3931	B
they're like a a stripes cat only they're huge they're like a small dog	3931	B
and they're real pretty	3931	B
oh boy let's see i'm trying to guess they get as big as like a small poodle	3931	B
a tough one	3966	A
would you like to begin	3966	A
uh-huh do you feel like there should be any kinds of restrictions on when it's	3966	A
obviously	3966	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3966	A
really do you mean even with adolescents	3966	A
uh-huh	3966	A
do you feel that it should be applied to them as well then same kind of laws or	3966	A
um-hum	3966	A
um-hum	3966	A
you think it's too lenient over all	3966	A
yeah	3966	A
uh-huh	3966	A
oh premeditated you mean versus uh uh-huh uh-huh	3966	A
at this point most capital punishment is really uh related to murder though right i mean there's no capital punishment unless a life has been lost	3966	A
i think i think that's the right	3966	A
i wonder something- i mean i believe as you do that something needs to change but i wonder sometimes what what makes an impact on criminals that do this kind of a crime i mean it it almost seems like	3966	A
they either don't believe it'll ever be them that's caught or if they do they don't really value their lives enough to care if they would lose their lives	3966	A
it's it's i i'm not even sure- i- i feel uh in between i guess i'm i'm not sure that i have a strong commitment either direction because	3966	A
i don't know enough about what- what would motivate these people you know i do think that they are some times um	3966	A
put in a rehabilitation program when there's really a very small chance of rehabilitation that that they're coddled for too long and they get the kind of courtesies of our society that that	3966	A
but	3966	A
it's a tough one	3966	A
in in what respect	3966	A
like what's within their legal rights or do you mean how to manipulate the system-	3966	A
uh-huh	3966	A
um-hum um-hum	3966	A
so they feign for example that they're really are um apologetic or what ever for their crime but they're	3966	A
but but you know that they aren't	3966	A
um-hum	3966	A
um-hum	3966	A
i'm sure that's easily learned if they don't get it from their peers they get it from going through the system one time being in juvenile court or what ever	3966	A
do you know if there's much of a difference between the law i'm i'm embarrassed to say i don't know between Texas and California what what difference is there	3966	A
hum	3966	A
uh-huh	3966	A
yeah	3966	A
uh-huh	3966	A
oh my uh-huh it is interesting to look at other cultures other countries and see how different their rates are you know you look at even um	3966	A
countries like Saudi Arabia where there's a lot of emotion and sometimes an	3966	A
yes it is i know well i- i believe in it	3966	B
i think	3966	B
uh yes i do think that but i do think that i believe in it whole heartedly i really think that a lot of crime we have the criminal	3966	B
you know element is just unreal i work in a high school here	3966	B
and it just boggles my mind what's happened over the last few years	3966	B
you know i've been there fifteen sixteen years and just watching the mentality of our teenagers and and this tough stuff that's going on now you know	3966	B
i uh well i think that they should- tougher laws for the teenagers yes i do believe that not but not the uh capital punishment for them	3966	B
i really don't feel that but i do feel tougher laws but some way i feel they have to uh revise our criminal system	3966	B
um-hum i really do and i think that the um oh rehab is terrible	3966	B
you know they put them_1 in there and there's too it's just because of numbers though i understand the rehab is so big that they can't	3966	B
but any way back to capital punishment i do believe in it for murderers and and especially um	3966	B
oh you know when they actually thinking about it	3966	B
is that number one manslaughter something like that	3966	B
i- i don't know i'm not real sure premeditated right murder definitely of course i do feel that and then these	3966	B
um-hum	3966	B
um-hum	3966	B
right right	3966	B
and um	3966	B
um-hum	3966	B
that's true	3966	B
um-hum	3966	B
right	3966	B
right	3966	B
um-hum	3966	B
yes yes that's right that's for sure	3966	B
well and sometimes the uh on the rehab uh i've just from being around the students that i'm around they know how to talk to the authorities	3966	B
they know exactly what to say to anybody in a	3966	B
uh they know the right answers you know	3966	B
right what's well what's within their legal rights and how to manipulate them	3966	B
and how to manipulate them just just they they answer to authority and to people	3966	B
to adults and that type of thing that they have to answer to or even the criminals do in to the people that count the judges and that type of thing you know they they usually answer to them	3966	B
in a way that like i said manipulative they just manipulate they've manipulated- manipulated so long so this is	3966	B
um-hum	3966	B
right and sorry- right and very- very sorrowful and then when they get out then we run into the problem of getting right back into a routine again of the same thing	3966	B
so	3966	B
um-hum	3966	B
um-hum	3966	B
i really don't myself i really don't i know they permit it here but i don't know you know the difference in it actually	3966	B
in fact we just had um a person put to death uh about_1 three weeks ago was in in Texas and i forget for the reason now oh it was for the uh that clergy that he murdered he murdered a uh	3966	B
a uh	3966	B
it was a priest i believe he murdered	3966	B
um-hum	3966	B
yes for because_1 most people are aging- getting older and the benefits- uh the benefits are going up- i mean the price is going up	3941	B
everything seems to go up	3941	B
yeah see here where well here where i live all the benefits have been going up lately up on health and there are hospitals that have- we have a one cent tax and then	3941	B
now Bush is coming up with this health plan so i don't know much- much about it then	3941	B
yes	3941	B
yeah one illness -will do it	3941	B
yes	3941	B
yeah i would- i would think so well that's one of the main- main i would think one of the main securities that you would need is health benefit	3941	B
yes	3941	B
well we i have my sister died and she had some benefits that helped through her well they had her hooked up and everything but that helped her helped us through it	3941	B
really	3941	B
um-hum just- just with the benefits going up it's just there's not a whole lot you can do about it really	3941	B
yes	3941	B
you're not- gonna make it very far	3941	B
uh the older the older you probably you would probably need- more help	3941	B
because_1 you know a lot of elderly- most of the elderly people don't have the money and the ones that do well they have insurance so	3941	B
it's- it's just a i think it they need to extend them_1	3941	B
because_1 we're we're paying here a lot	3941	B
and	3941	B
i think the elderly needs it more than anything	3941	B
yeah	3941	B
no	3941	B
really have they got it- have they already signed that or that's not signed yet is it	3941	B
well they	3941	B
okay	3941	A
you think health benefits probably the the most important	3941	A
that's true that	3941	A
that that's the case or the problem i have i'm getting older and uh the wife and uh we	3941	A
use the doctors more have um more health problems and that is a very important benefit that uh	3941	A
what	3941	A
um-hum	3941	A
no i've i haven't really studied that too much but uh that is one of the benefits that uh	3941	A
that i feel that uh is real good	3941	A
with uh the company i work for so far but uh it it's uh	3941	A
you know what's gonna happen their costs keep going up as you say and it's uh it could wipe a a family out or uh all your savings and everything one one serious illness	3941	A
i think that's uh one of the benefits that we really need to our companies need- really need to take a look at because_1 there's so many Americans that are not covered at all that's uh	3941	A
quite a situation i think the other thing uh security and that that's getting pretty tough now a a a job with security	3941	A
uh especially if you're in uh department of defense or you're in the auto industry been working for fifteen or twenty years and all of a sudden uh	3941	A
because of changes in Europe this uh	3941	A
holidays- holidays so many people are losing their jobs and uh i don't know how you can as- as a benefit how you could have- have security as one but most people like to have that security in their jobs	3941	A
um-hum	3941	A
i'll say yeah it really is and uh it's uh you really feel sorry for those who don't have it or they have a	3941	A
uh cancer or something real serious that uh could runs up their uh transplant- heart transplant or something runs up into	3941	A
uh um hundreds of thousands of dollars	3941	A
that could wipe you out in a hurry	3941	A
good good good a good thing that uh they she had those i think there's other uh	3941	A
well there's other benefits that uh kind of or look at i guess uh need a vacation once in a while most jobs do that	3941	A
uh give you some time off and uh that's something that uh	3941	A
each company's a little different on that but most of them_1 are pretty good on those uh those type of benefits i think	3941	A
no there isn't and another one i think is uh quite important of course is retirement system that they they have	3941	A
and uh with social security and uh the way it is if that's all you got is social security by then-	3941	A
right by the time i get up there uh in a few years and uh draw social security with the cost of living uh that benefit is just really not gonna help very much	3941	A
um-hum	3941	A
no	3941	A
um-hum yeah	3941	A
um-hum yes	3941	A
that's true and uh it seems like it goes up every year you have no control over the the cost to you and that just takes away your buying power also and uh	3941	A
the company of course i can see the company's side uh too because uh they have to pay uh an a proportion of whatever the	3941	A
the health cost is and it gets to the point where uh they're not uh making money and uh	3941	A
it uh	3941	A
i don't wanna see us to go socialized medicine like they are in England or places like that	3941	A
but still uh i- i hope that this plan that uh the President's come up with uh is gonna help all those or help some way	3941	A
bottom line though who's gonna pay for it	3941	A
no no he he just uh proposed it and uh	3941	A
the republicans are saying hey it's a great plan the democrats say it's no good so	3941	A
well i'm not uh painting of the artist	3960	B
variety what i like to do is i like to paint the inside of a house	3960	B
paint cabinets or paint furniture	3960	B
but i'm not doing much of that right now haven't for quite some time	3960	B
how about you	3960	B
just- just uh	3960	B
old fashioned brush and roller yes yeah when	3960	B
yes uh a a very messy way too uh we haven't done much painting	3960	B
interior or exterior in the last uh two years two and a half years we we bought a mobile home and with the natural oak	3960	B
or natural wood paneling on the inside we don't have that painting to	3960	B
to contend with but uh my husband has painted uh some of our storage buildings and	3960	B
when he put the uh	3960	B
skirting around the the mobile home then it had to be	3960	B
uh	3960	B
sealed painted	3960	B
yes it is uh probably the summers- the summers are harder winters- actually than the winters are because it uh the sun you know bakes and dries them_1 out and we don't have an a lot of freezing weather like you would in Idaho	3960	B
uh usually not more often than about every oh three to five years depending on the type of finish that you use and too the the type of wood that you're putting it on	3960	B
oh that is the um the only thing that that i know of we um	3960	B
were fortunate in that the last uh	3960	B
painting work that my husband did was	3960	B
on new finish so it didn't have to be	3960	B
prepped anyway	3960	B
we had painted uh or had paint i had a house painted that we owned over in uh Greenville and we had it brushed and scraped	3960	B
and uh a primer coat brushed on and then the in fact i think there was two coats of primer and then three coats of the	3960	B
uh paint that went on that it was an old frame- frame house but it lasted very very well it must have been on there nearly ten years before it needed painting again	3960	B
yeah that sounds familiar too my husband hates to see me get the painting bug because he says i'm i make a a terrible mess and i guess i do but um	3960	B
uh in the times that he has helped me taping the uh one of those plastic drop cloths to the baseboard	3960	B
and then setting chairs or something against it to keep the	3960	B
keep it from getting kicked loose	3960	B
is about the best way to keep it	3960	B
you know from	3960	B
speckling all around	3960	B
how did you get involved in the	3960	B
uh	3960	B
this	3960	B
project that we're doing on the	3960	B
voice recording	3960	B
uh-huh	3960	B
okay Jean what what have you recently painted	3960	A
um-hum	3960	A
um-hum	3960	A
uh-huh	3960	A
well i painted a shed this summer that i built and i went and borrowed a	3960	A
uh a paint sprayer from a a fellow that i know i'm good friends with	3960	A
and it's the only way to go i painted eight gallons of paint um i i put some stain and stuff on a on a redwood deck i made and i painted the uh	3960	A
my shed and it probably took me about six hours but it was just it's just incredible how much easier it is uh with a spray gun how much smoother it goes on and even and more professional looking and	3960	A
um i don't know i was just really pleased with it do you use some kind of a power painter rollers or something when you paint or	3960	A
is that right	3960	A
you- you-	3960	A
you do it the hard way i shouldn't	3960	A
these sound so hard but	3960	A
um-hum	3960	A
um-hum	3960	A
um	3960	A
how do you uh oh i would imagine	3960	A
that the weather's pretty hard on paints down there is it is it not	3960	A
uh-huh	3960	A
uh-huh how frequently do you have to paint then	3960	A
how- how do you uh prep your wood	3960	A
is there a fast easy way or is it just the old scraper brush on the outside is i guess what i'm speaking of	3960	A
um-hum	3960	A
hm	3960	A
inside how do you keep the paint off your carpet	3960	A
or do you have that problem anytime i try something like that i got paint all over the carpet	3960	A
and we're in there with uh i have to use water base paint and and uh in there with a big wet towel and	3960	A
about every three minutes i got to stop and clean my paint specks up all over	3960	A
huh	3960	A
yes	3960	A
um-hum	3960	A
uh	3960	A
uh	3960	A
Brian White from down there as i mentioned before	3960	A
sent his- his wife and my uh and my wife of course are sisters- are sisters and they got involved in it they got us involved in it	3960	A
but kind of enjoyed it	3960	A
um	3960	A
don't always have time to	3960	A
to pick the phone up and participate	3960	A
since i was just feeling extremely guilty about this it's a timely question um i do not exercise enough i have um	3958	B
i'm overweight and uh under under exercised and um can i can tell it affects me and i don't know why i can't make myself do it	3958	B
well i used to i used to do more things uh currently i've just gotten a they're a really nice tape Angela Lansbury has done and it's very mild it's mostly stretching but i've i've	3958	B
more mornings than not i will do at least ten minutes with her which is a good starter then then there's a twenty minute part afterwards that i tell myself every day when i get back i have a	3958	B
erratic schedule you know and when i come back in i'll do the twenty minutes uh-huh but anyway uh	3958	B
it's some some a little something yes but uh i really enjoy walking and somehow i'll do it for a while maybe a month or two months and you know walk two miles a day or something and then	3958	B
and then quit i	3958	B
it's hard- hard to schedule in what about you	3958	B
yes	3958	B
um-hum	3958	B
um	3958	B
yeah that's hard isn't it uh that that four to six o'clock i see a lot of people out walking and i just think oh i'm just going to go and you know just sit	3958	B
um yeah	3958	B
oh	3958	B
oh i see	3958	B
um	3958	B
yeah	3958	B
yeah	3958	B
and so do you do it	3958	B
uh-huh and you're thinking about getting them_1	3958	B
oh yeah	3958	B
yeah	3958	B
yeah that	3958	B
it is and it is hard to do i mean it is easier to do at home even the walking which i can do right here the idea of getting- of getting in a car to drive to a	3958	B
a place which a number of my friends keep suggesting	3958	B
just exhausts me because i drive so much in my job and i just am not going to get back in the car to drive somewhere you know and there are all these people there and you have to put on these clothes and and i uh so i'd much rather do it here now my daughter has a	3958	B
a bike uh but it's a real bike and she cycles and she can put it on a thing but you have to be the right size to fit that	3958	B
i've thought i've thought about doing that uh this tape is nice walking as i say is one that i really like i'm concerned about flexibility i'm i'm almost fifty and and i can you know begin to feel a little of that	3958	B
going and- and i want to be able to turn around and see if the you know uh when i'm driving uh not just look in the rear view mirror but easily turn around and go up steps and all that without huffing and puffing	3958	B
yes yeah yeah my legs	3958	B
yes	3958	B
well there is there is that that is a plus and i did do that i used to do it and and it and it is a plus and i almost took Tai Che that's something that's interested me for a long time and i	3958	B
oh uh it is beautiful and it seems like it it combines a lot of things so- so you know sort of a a mental attitude as well as the physical but um	3958	B
the the the guy insisted that you would have to come everytime he- and i thought well this is really good because he's you know dedicated and you have to do these things but the first	3958	B
three Saturdays uh i was doing trainings i mean you know it's it was on Saturday mornings and already they you know i i already couldn't do it so i was like oh okay well that's	3958	B
yeah that's the problem and he just says has to be you know i've got a class opening at nine thirty on Saturday and you can every once in a while go to a different class but you- that's when you're supposed to come	3958	B
and actually i hadn't been doing any Saturday trainings and then all of a sudden	3958	B
right when the class opened	3958	B
you know	3958	B
so	3958	B
do regular exercise	3958	A
have you have you tried uh you know beginning something and it hasn't worked so you've	3958	A
stopped after a while or just try to get	3958	A
well that's good i mean at least you've given some time to it every day it's not as if you're not doing anything	3958	A
uh-huh	3958	A
it is you know i think the problem for me has always been trying to find a time of day that's going to work um	3958	A
i think probably the best way to get it done is to do it in the morning but i'm not a morning person	3958	A
and if i try to wait till the end of the day when i think i have a little bit more time i don't always have the energy level	3958	A
yeah	3958	A
you get home and you start fixing dinner or whatever	3958	A
um i've tried to do a combination of stretching and and strengthening because my problem has been	3958	A
keeping strong i think enough i i tend if i don't	3958	A
i tend to have over stretched muscles in fact it's called a hypomobility	3958	A
but if i don't keep strong enough i can pull a muscle more easily say if i go on vacation	3958	A
uh and pick up some heavy suitcases it might stretch a muscle that	3958	A
would not have felt injured if i had kept the muscle strong enough to really support the joints so	3958	A
that's	3958	A
well you know tomorrow night there's a sale at one of the shopping centers close by on barbells well	3958	A
i'm definitely going to because i work at a hospital where there is a physical therapy department and i've used their barbells for a long while but i know i need to get more regular and do it at home so if i	3958	A
purchase my own i think i'm more inclined to do so and they're a good price	3958	A
see i can't do that	3958	A
yeah and	3958	A
that's that's- exactly the same with me	3958	A
oh so you've thought about that as well a bike exercise	3958	A
um-hum	3958	A
uh-huh uh-huh	3958	A
well	3958	A
right	3958	A
feel it in your neck in other words	3958	A
uh-huh	3958	A
it's interesting some people choose to go to classes because they feel that that will maintain their motivation they've either invested the money in it or there're people there that expect them or	3958	A
whatever but i think it's just the opposite with me i i need to have the flexibility to do it on my own time and yet	3958	A
i'm not sure	3958	A
it is beautiful um-hum	3958	A
um-hum um-hum	3958	A
oh jobs-	3958	A
uh-huh	3958	A
needs to be more flexible for your schedule	3958	A
um-hum um-hum	3958	A
i'm	3958	A
you stand on gun control	3953	A
uh-huh	3953	A
i- i did a fair bit of hunting when i was growing up i pretty well haven't in the last uh fifteen or twenty years pretty well given it up so	3953	A
um now i do have some guns uh uh	3953	A
i enjoy shooting you know for as far as targets and all but i don't particularly enjoy hunting any more i'm not really opposed to it uh	3953	A
but i am i am in favor of uh some some form of of gun control	3953	A
yeah	3953	A
yeah	3953	A
i i don't see why you'd oppose it either you know the uh the um	3953	A
for people who want them_1 for legitimate purposes i mean there's seven days or even even i'd even be in favor of a a yeah thirty days i mean you don't need a gun on short notice	3953	A
yeah for	3953	A
right that's right	3953	A
that's right and yeah and and uh	3953	A
yeah and uh and the automatic- some of the automatic weapons that are sold yeah certainly have no purpose other than to	3953	A
uh kill humans you know when you're talking about some of these automatic weapons	3953	A
that's right yeah you get these twenty and thirty shot rounds	3953	A
yeah	3953	A
uh-huh was just was it just outside some place or	3953	A
yeah that that's true yeah uh and and it's pretty pretty common that it happens with uh	3953	A
kids too you know the parent think that the guns hidden or that their uh kids won't bother it but then when they're left alone sometimes uh	3953	A
gun- a kid will show it off to a friend and they'll start handling it and pretty soon somebody gets shot	3953	A
i- i think what they're afraid of is that uh not necessarily of this one particular law or about a waiting period but i think they're afraid that once you know uh	3953	A
you establish one regulation they're afraid others would get started	3953	A
yeah	3953	A
let me	3953	A
let me switch from my other phone here i- i think my hand phone is going dead here	3953	A
okay can you still hear me okay yeah i was just shutting the other one down	3953	A
hello oh know- know- i don't know who's on that one	3953	A
you there yeah i i'm getting a lot of static i'm not sure what's going on here i switched phones it may be mine um	3953	A
okay um	3953	A
i think they on on they were asking about a numbering system i guess	3953	A
um	3953	B
i don't know i don't use guns i mean and i don't you know i- i don't have any occasion to i've never been much of a hunter and any of that so	3953	B
i guess i haven't really felt	3953	B
real strongly one way or the other	3953	B
how about_1 you	3953	B
uh-huh	3953	B
um-hum	3953	B
uh-huh	3953	B
right	3953	B
yeah well i guess i do too i um	3953	B
i think that law that they tried to pass i'm not even sure if they passed it or not the seven uh seven day waiting period	3953	B
i- i think that's a a reasonable law and i'm not real sure why the NRA was against it um you know it it really didn't	3953	B
the only thing it restricted was that you couldn't pick up the gun right away	3953	B
um	3953	B
yeah seven days shouldn't be a a big a big deal	3953	B
yeah	3953	B
right	3953	B
and if you do you want the gun for something else other than than shooting target because_1 you can always get a gun to go and shoot you know target with	3953	B
or you know even hunt you can borrow a gun to do that but uh you know if you want it right away you you want it for a different reason than than the legitimate reason for having a gun	3953	B
yeah it yeah and i- i wonder about that because the the the sale of automatic weapons because uh	3953	B
if you need thirty shots to kill a deer you should be uh you you should be shooting with a camera because_1 you're dangerous anyway	3953	B
that's right	3953	B
so i yeah i guess we uh we kind of feel the same way about about that i uh it's it's funny because i was over at in McKinney the other day and picking up a dog	3953	B
and um and i saw some women um	3953	B
practicing you know shooting	3953	B
and	3953	B
just outside yeah out out in the uh range	3953	B
but um i it reminded me of uh you know i was listening to a talk show the other day and and heard that	3953	B
the majority of the accidents that happen or the shooting that happens happens right in the home with somebody that you know	3953	B
misuse of a gun	3953	B
yeah	3953	B
yeah	3953	B
a lot of that happened and yeah i- i don't i don't really see why the NRA would oppose i guess it's because they you know they don't want any any kind of uh of government restrictions on	3953	B
then it's a lot easier to just keep going from there	3953	B
but	3953	B
is that your phone or mine	3953	B
yeah	3953	B
you you must've had a cordless	3953	B
hello	3953	B
hello- hello	3953	B
oh	3953	B
hello	3953	B
you still there	3953	B
huh	3953	B
well i've i've switched phones so	3953	B
yes	3926	B
yeah	3926	B
well as i look at our trial systems i think they've gotten to be quite a joke the way that people can appeal and file for mistrials and they've taken a lot of the things that that were set up to make it be a fair system	3926	B
and used it to their advantage	3926	B
i think that a jury should listen to the court	3926	B
uh to to the hearings and to everything but i think they should only weigh fifty percent of the decision	3926	B
i think the judge should hold the fifty- or maybe even forty nine and the judge should be able to rule one way or the other	3926	B
i think he should and i think that there should be more than one judge there should be maybe two	3926	B
at least that sit in and listen so that there's no way that you could have	3926	B
like a crooked judge do you know what i mean	3926	B
um and i think that there it's important to have a jury	3926	B
but i think the way that they go through so much time to get a a fair one that's okay too as long as it's not used to delay the trial so much	3926	B
they need to have a fair jury but they only would- you know would cover	3926	B
fifty- forty nine percent of the decision or fifty percent and then the two judges would go ahead and make the final decision	3926	B
how do you feel about that	3926	B
right	3926	B
right	3926	B
right	3926	B
right well what if they used you know i just had a thought come as you were talking what if they used law students	3926	B
and had that be credit hours to sit in trials	3926	B
yeah at least at least on the jury and that would give them experience in the courtroom and it could count as some aspect or hours going into their major	3926	B
right	3926	B
that's right that would be a really good thing to do	3926	B
i i have a girlfriend that just went through a three year trial	3926	B
and what happened was her husband was um	3926	B
involved in a motorcycle accident where a drunk driver ran the stop light and ran into the motorcycle	3926	B
but the reason the actual reason that the motorcycle person her husband was killed was because his brakes	3926	B
went out on his motorcycle he was just taking it home from the place it was brand new and his brakes did not work	3926	B
and this expensive big company that owned these motorcycles	3926	B
um railroaded this into three years worth of trials for this lady and she had a son that was just only two years old when it happened	3926	B
and they were following him home in the car saw the whole thing happen	3926	B
that's right they were following him home from the motorcycle shop	3926	B
and they railroaded this whole trial into mistrials um this and that and the other every time she'd get a verdict that would be in her favor of a of a settlement	3926	B
until finally they won and said that it was the drunk driver's fault and she would have to sue him	3926	B
which i would think it would be some his fault but i just felt like justice wasn't served because they had the money the big lawyers and she didn't	3926	B
right	3926	B
right and i don't know all the details on that but i certainly think that we've come up with a good idea with the	3926	B
the student- the students coming into the jury	3926	B
and i don't think that it would be such a bad idea even if the judge didn't have the final say	3926	B
that's it	3926	A
what do you think are possible changes in the uh the way trials are conducted these days do you like the way some people in there for instance really take over and uh	3926	A
we have no way of knowing whether they're legitimately right or wrong so forth	3926	A
what do you think about these things	3926	A
you you're so you're saying you you think the judge should actually have the final say	3926	A
hum	3926	A
yes i know what you mean	3926	A
well	3926	A
i hadn't uh thought of it from that point of view before i have been in a fairly important trial	3926	A
and uh what bothers me is	3926	A
i was concerned of the ability of some of the people in the jury to adequately understand	3926	A
what was being presented so that they themselves could make a proper and uh accurate decision	3926	A
that's the part that bothered me about it	3926	A
um i really think that the the the jury ought to have more say so in the selection or in the determination of whether they're guilty or not but i also think that the jury should be	3926	A
uh very very uh carefully more carefully selected to make sure that they are entirely intelligent- intelligent people and that they understand some of the details that are involved so that they can make accurate- accurate decisions	3926	A
i hate to see people brought in who basically have lived out in the country and don't know much about any of this stuff and	3926	A
and they just make a decision based on whether they like the dress she wore that day or whether that guy smiled or growled all the time that's no way to make a decision on some terrible problem	3926	A
that would be certainly nice shit- let's say we we would have fifty percent of them_1 law students at any rate yeah yeah	3926	A
um-hum	3926	A
that's a very neat idea and they would learn a lot about being lawyers later in life when they see what it is like to be in the jury side of a trial	3926	A
that would be a a really good thing to do	3926	A
so -that's	3926	A
hum	3926	A
um	3926	A
for goodness sakes	3926	A
um-hum	3926	A
oh they saw the husband get	3926	A
yeah	3926	A
they'd find something wrong with it	3926	A
did they really	3926	A
uh-huh	3926	A
that is a shame you'd think there would be enough uh people who saw the accident other than his wife	3926	A
to to also uh make statements and they have nothing to gain one way or the other so if they say a certain way then why not believe them_1	3926	A
yeah	3926	A
um-hum	3926	A
you know i was i was thinking about that while i was waiting for the connection i i think uh you know it's uh uh a military threat certainly i don't feel like it's like it was back in the the sixties whenever Kruschev said he was going to bury us	3919	A
uh at the same time i i think they may still be a threat in a different sort of a way in that uh the situation over there is so unstable	3919	A
and and the especially the economics uh uh ramifications of whatever is going to happen over there i mean they're like a a quarter of the land mass of the earth	3919	A
you know and and if things don't get straightened out over there it it will impact us one way or the other i think	3919	A
is that right i hadn't heard that	3919	A
yeah or or any one of the other uh nuts that are running around yeah	3919	A
uh-huh	3919	A
yeah	3919	A
well it's uh i don't know it's it's amazing to see uh the kind of changes that's happened just in the past uh you know not even ten years or even five years it's just awesome	3919	A
yeah	3919	A
yeah	3919	A
yeah but even so he seems to be a much more reasonable person than than you know previous Soviet leaders	3919	A
and uh	3919	A
you know it's just uh uh you see this the uh you know on television the the uh shows uh on the news with the the people waiting in line	3919	A
they had last night i think it was on ABC where some Soviet doctors had gone on strike because their uh	3919	A
monthly salary was about enough money to buy them_1 six pounds of sausage with you know the new increase in prices	3919	A
which is you know of course doctors over there aren't held in the same rare high esteem that they have here in the US	3919	A
but	3919	A
yeah	3919	A
huh	3919	A
yeah yeah you know i i would even consider moving to Iraq for that i mean	3919	A
well anyway it's	3919	A
yeah yeah well as a matter of fact i know that uh you know they they were concerned about the Soviet brain drain because there're so many of their top people just uh like you say they they	3919	A
you know are are being given offers elsewhere and some of them_1 i think are even coming to the US if we can get them_1 you know rather than let them_1 uh go to one of those third world countries	3919	A
well i'm all for them_1 providing as you know as much support as we can at the same time you know it's time for us i think as a country to run us you know the rest of the world really is not our responsibility	3919	A
it's good for us to look after our own best interests even in uh you know an international way but at the same time we- i don't think that we have the resources to bale out the entire Soviet Union	3919	A
yeah	3919	A
you know the amazing thing about- about it is how these people who've been operating for you know seventy generations under a uh uh	3919	A
you know the the protectorate- protectorate of the the government over them that they really don't even have a concept of what capitalism is	3919	A
and- and and as a matter of fact i'm not a guy with my company was in Moscow several weeks ago and i asked him what it was like and he said you know he said they start drinking vodka at ten o'clock in the morning	3919	A
but uh anyway it's uh uh i don't know there there just	3919	A
they've got a really uh different outlook and a different mentality than uh uh people than have anybody that has been accustomed to living uh under any form of capitalism and it's going to take quite a while for them to to realize that uh	3919	A
so you think uh the Soviet Union's a threat anymore to US	3919	B
um-hum	3919	B
yeah yeah	3919	B
um-hum	3919	B
um-hum um-hum	3919	B
right right	3919	B
i think i'm just afraid of uh what they're going to do with their nuclear warheads that they already have right now that uh they said you know they're open to uh anybody who's willing to pay the money i think uh Ukraine said that you know if you've got the money for it we'll give you the warheads	3919	B
yeah	3919	B
and uh i'm just afraid you know some some guy like Sadaam Hussein	3919	B
oh yeah i mean	3919	B
um-hum	3919	B
yeah yeah	3919	B
well you know it's i guess the break up it's self was was uh kind of unusual and then now all of a sudden	3919	B
you know Gorbachev who was uh in the US's pocket pretty much	3919	B
is now gone you know and now we've got Yeltsin- uh Yeltsin who seems like he's a little bit of a hard ball typical	3919	B
typical communist-	3919	B
oh yeah doesn't	3919	B
right right that's true	3919	B
um-hum	3919	B
uh-huh uh-huh	3919	B
uh-huh	3919	B
right hm	3919	B
um-hum um-hum well	3919	B
the other thing was uh like nuclear scientists over there were being uh taken in by you know other countries you know	3919	B
because_1 i mean like you said they're not being paid very much over there and and whereas they can command salaries of you know twenty thousand dollars a month	3919	B
in uh you know these middle eastern countries that you know oil bearing countries you know	3919	B
and i saw that they uh Iraq and Iran had offered uh twenty thousand dollars a month to nuclear scientists i mean	3919	B
who wouldn't want that kind of money	3919	B
yeah	3919	B
yeah really	3919	B
but i mean and and these and these are guys that couldn't eat you know so	3919	B
so	3919	B
right	3919	B
um-hum um-hum	3919	B
um-hum well i think the US is eventually going to have to step in i mean you've got this you know big country that's now	3919	B
uh pretty much uh in chaos because_1 uh i mean the all the things that's split up and they've got the nuclear arsenal to you know pretty much eliminate the rest of the world	3919	B
and uh they've asked for US support and i think the US is going to have to give in	3919	B
because	3919	B
yeah	3919	B
um-hum um-hum	3919	B
um-hum um-hum	3919	B
um-hum	3919	B
no i don't think as far as bail out goes i'm thinking more on the sense of uh um helping them_1 take the infrastructure they have	3919	B
and putting it to use i mean they've got a good infrastructure there i mean they at one time were you know they they were a threat to the US i mean they had the weapons ability they had the manufacturing capability	3919	B
and i think it's all kind of disorganized right now	3919	B
right	3919	B
um-hum yeah yeah	3919	B
uh-huh	3919	B
um-hum	3919	B
yeah yeah	3919	B
yeah i wish there was that kind of uh stuff over here it'd be great	3919	B
yeah yeah	3919	B
um-hum	3919	B
hm um-hum	3919	B
yeah yeah	3919	B
how do you feel about drug testing Helen	3928	A
yeah neither do i i think that uh it's something that uh	3928	A
uh i i can appreciate if uh i were an employer or uh that uh i would want to uh ascertain the state of the uh employee	3928	A
uh i don't know that	3928	A
personally i would you know i i've started a new job um about a year and a half ago and of course had to go through the physical and the test and you know didn't have any problem with it now one thing i've never experienced is being	3928	A
randomly tested and while i	3928	A
you know don't have a problem personally with it as far as passing the test i don't know that i would relish being you know pulled out and said hey you know	3928	A
roll up your sleeve or or go use this jar but uh i think that there's some companies that do that	3928	A
yeah	3928	A
yeah that's	3928	A
that is a good point i don't want a uh uh pilot hangover	3928	A
yeah right	3928	A
yeah	3928	A
yeah	3928	A
yeah i have a friend of mine who works uh for a company in Atlanta	3928	A
and uh they you know made it clear about you know policy that they were going to start the drug testing and then you know advertised it about oh four or five months he said even before they ever started	3928	A
and uh he said one of his bosses was saying that you know should someone test positive that didn't necessarily mean that they would be fired and my friend said well they ought to fire him and he said well perhaps that's you know	3928	A
this boss well maybe that might be a little harsh and he said no i'm not talking about firing him for doing the drugs i'm talking about firing him because_1 he's so stupid that they would continue to do it and	3928	A
with that much advance- exactly with that much advance notice you know if they are that dumb they ought to get rid of them_1 so	3928	A
i kind of liked his uh line of thinking	3928	A
yeah i don't know it's it's something that that uh i don't know i think that the uh	3928	A
and and maybe i'm optimistic but i think to a great extent uh uh some of the uh casual use of uh the baby boomers	3928	A
back uh you know in the seventies and the eighties perhaps is moderating now certainly that doesn't mean that there's not still a severe problem and especially with crack cocaine which i think is just	3928	A
a scourge on society uh	3928	A
but uh perhaps the recreational use might be declining a little bit and i hope it is	3928	A
oh yeah yeah	3928	A
yeah and then the one not only that i mean just everything i mean it's	3928	A
awesome to think of anyone raising children to me right now but	3928	A
um	3928	A
uh-huh	3928	A
yeah and at the same time i mean i uh if uh	3928	A
with the cost of health care and uh	3928	A
just all the additional uh expenses of of recruiting employees like i say i can understand uh the necessity of being tested and again that's only only happened to me one time but uh i didn't	3928	A
i didn't feel badly about it at all i was more than happy to uh uh submit to the test	3928	A
yeah right or certainly not working up to their full potential	3928	A
yeah but um well i don't know it's we're in such a perfect harmony on this topic	3928	A
and i do know that we need to keep with the topic so let's see what else-	3928	A
uh i have no problem with it	3928	B
um-hum	3928	B
um-hum	3928	B
well i guess i particularly feel in fields such as airline pilots or people who are involved in mass transportation	3928	B
i definitely feel these people should be tested particularly in light of some of the accidents that have happened	3928	B
if for many things	3928	B
really yes i agree with that	3928	B
um i guess well i'm very {antidrugs} and uh i guess it really doesn't bother me whatever they have to do you know to	3928	B
to keep the workplace or or the country or the world or whatever drug free is fine with me i i've never been tested for drugs i've never worked for companies that required it or anything but	3928	B
it really wouldn't bother me a bit if they said if someone said hey we're going to start testing testing- um excuse me testing for drugs	3928	B
with that much advance notice	3928	B
oh	3928	B
well i'm trying to think of something else we can talk about on this conversation the	3928	B
um-hum	3928	B
well it's just so frightening when i hear of of uh children in grade school you know that are being exposed to this i i would hate to be a child today and have the peer pressure	3928	B
uh from this sort of thing	3928	B
right	3928	B
um-hum um-hum	3928	B
well perhaps uh there will be a turnaround you know you hear the statistics and they do say that	3928	B
it's looking better now whether that's a little bit of PR on the part of the government or what i don't know i i but i hope that they're correct	3928	B
um-hum	3928	B
well at least you know that the company you're working for is doing something to uh	3928	B
increase productivity or what because i think that you know is part of it uh looking to make sure that they have productive employees because it appears to me that people that are on drugs aren't really all that productive	3928	B
for sure	3928	B
i know we have i	3928	B
i'm Bridget	3998	A
are you i'm in Lubbock	3998	A
yeah	3998	A
i go to school at Tech	3998	A
okay you ready for me to push one	3998	A
okay	3998	A
okay	3998	A
so what do you think about the elderly and their health care	3998	A
uh-huh	3998	A
yeah i think that's really sad	3998	A
yeah i have um my great grandmother was in one and i used to go visit her a lot i think it's sad because one it's so expensive	3998	A
just to put them in there and it's such a traumatic decision anyway	3998	A
and then it's like no one goes and sees them i think that's really sad i mean that- i didn't even think about that what i first was thinking about this topic and stuff and that's just that's that's amazes me you know	3998	A
no i don't think so	3998	A
uh-huh	3998	A
but they need someone to take care of them you know	3998	A
you can kind of see both sides i mean the people that have to be in one you know should be or people that are just put in one you know that do not need serious you know medical care i think that's kind of sad	3998	A
yeah that's uh-huh	3998	A
yeah	3998	A
yeah	3998	A
should go back to that	3998	A
think more people should do that	3998	A
hard as it may sound or be for some people it's not really that hard	3998	A
least it would be easier	3998	A
uh-huh that's true	3998	A
yeah there's going to be more older people	3998	A
whether they like to admit it or not	3998	A
that's true though i didn't think about that either people got to think about that	3998	A
and just i just think it's it's kind of sad even knowing if your you know if your parents would even want to go in one or not you know i mean my parents are like no way i know there's no way they would ever want to be put in one	3998	A
and i know that my parents plan to take care of their parents you know if it ever gets to the point where they can't take care of themselves you know they're going to go to Florida or whatever to take care of them	3998	A
that's what they have to do because they don't want to just put them in a nursing home	3998	A
they don't think that's right	3998	A
i guess it would depend on a lot of things like like financial especially	3998	A
and depending on how old they are and how you know i can see if like my grandmother whose mother used to be in a nursing home she used to go up there and see her every day	3998	A
whose my great-grandmother was in one she used to go see her every day and that is great but when she got sick then you know she can't go see her and stuff and you can't expect so i guess it would depend on how old they were too	3998	A
because if if the parents- if the children were too old to take care of the parents then	3998	A
i don't think that would be very good either	3998	A
pretty touchy topic	3998	A
oh yeah	3998	A
at least	3998	A
they're pretty expensive	3998	A
but people always figure it as if they had a live in nurse too that's you know just as expensive	3998	A
it is because i know when my grandmother was looking to put her mother in	3998	A
that is a big ordeal she's like well it's just expensive to have a nurse twenty four hours a day than it is to put her in a a place where at least there's other people you know	3998	A
i mean and she went and saw her every day like i said and that's good i think because i don't think if you just put them in there and forget about them i don't think that's right	3998	A
think that's sad	3998	A
hi	3998	B
hi Bridget i'm Gunner i'm here in Dallas	3998	B
oh you are oh okay	3998	B
oh okay	3998	B
yeah sure am	3998	B
okay	3998	B
well uh i think there uh you know need to have uh some some means of taking care of them in a in a reasonable and uh uh	3998	B
i guess respectful way	3998	B
and uh it's uh	3998	B
i guess my biggest problem is that uh they seem to uh be	3998	B
you know put in nursing homes and just forgotten about that's	3998	B
you know	3998	B
have you uh ever spent much time or worked around one or anything	3998	B
oh yeah	3998	B
is there uh uh	3998	B
well shoot i guess there's no uh Medicare i don't think pays for it	3998	B
um	3998	B
um i don't know it's just the whole thing is just kind of amazing to me	3998	B
uh	3998	B
uh-huh	3998	B
yeah and a lot of other countries though uh uh you know basically like family takes them	3998	B
and uh i guess take them for as long as they are you know as long as they live	3998	B
well i yeah i do too	3998	B
um	3998	B
especially now that all the you know everybody is getting older and living longer and	3998	B
uh	3998	B
you know it's it's	3998	B
there's going to be more and more folks	3998	B
hm	3998	B
yeah	3998	B
um yeah	3998	B
yeah	3998	B
um yeah that is uh that's difficult i tell you	3998	B
uh-huh	3998	B
yeah yeah	3998	B
hm	3998	B
yeah it sure is i know like uh uh lot of places it's like hundred dollars a day	3998	B
you know	3998	B
i know but uh	3998	B
is it i don't even know	3998	B
yeah	3998	B
yeah yeah really	3998	B
i'm Bridget	3984	A
it's nice to meet you	3984	A
i'm in Lubbock	3984	A
are you	3984	A
okay good you ready for me to push one then okay	3984	A
so what kind of clothes do you wear to work	3984	A
uh-huh	3984	A
are you	3984	A
okay well this is kind of a hard topic because_1 i don't work	3984	A
no i'm in college so	3984	A
but i think	3984	A
pardon	3984	A
yeah	3984	A
but i think if i was going to go to work and stuff i think a dress or more like a suit would would be more appropriate for sure	3984	A
um-hum	3984	A
yeah doesn't get that hot	3984	A
i don't know i can't i would i wouldn't like to have to wear a suit every day though i wouldn't like that at all	3984	A
yeah	3984	A
um	3984	A
with dress clothes	3984	A
i honestly i don't know because	3984	A
i haven't had to wear that many dress clothes yet to be honest you know	3984	A
i really don't think i- i don't even i couldn't even tell you	3984	A
but i would say i don't know	3984	A
yeah that's true anything you don't have to iron that you can just send to the cleaners sounds great	3984	A
really do you wear really dressy dresses to work	3984	A
do you oh okay so you go all out and everything	3984	A
yeah well that would be important though i mean you would have to	3984	A
uh-huh	3984	A
i bet you couldn't	3984	A
um i usually get like i usually get Nike	3984	A
with shoes and stuff like that	3984	A
i'm real big my feet get real sore real easily so i have to have really well padded shoes	3984	A
uh-huh yeah i love sweaters	3984	A
yeah because it gets really cold up here i mean you get the turtle neck sweater jacket thing a lot	3984	A
so i mean i would say mostly like now it's like you could wear like a T-shirt or sweat shirt because it's usually chilly in the morning but it's it's warmer at night	3984	A
but in the winter you have to bundle up because it gets really cold	3984	A
it's a lot different because i i'm from Dallas	3984	A
yeah i think it's a lot colder than it does in Dallas that's for sure with all the snow and everything	3984	A
yeah because_1 i because_1 i am from Dallas and i live in Richardson so	3984	A
i mean it gets cold there but it's not cold like it gets here and i think here it gets cold and it gets windy you have a you know wind chill at twenty miles an hour and it gets like bitter cold	3984	A
and you have to walk across campus and stuff so you really wear a lot of clothes i mean everybody has on like gloves and scarves and ear muffs and everything	3984	A
uh-huh yeah	3984	A
um	3984	A
hum i have like one and i wear it when i dress up	3984	A
but otherwise i don't have that many though i don't think about it i'm not real good at picking out clothes like if someone were to buy me an outfit and put out with it i would wear it all the time but as far as me picking out clothes myself oh it's not very good	3984	A
yeah i probably will go to graduate school because_1 i want to be a marriage counselor	3984	A
but i'll still need nice clothes- you know whatever i do if i do that or if i go into business then i'll still need dress clothes like nice dresses and nice suits and stuff like that	3984	A
that's what i plan on waning wearing to work when i go to work	3984	A
to the	3984	A
um	3984	A
hi	3984	B
i'm Barbara	3984	B
well it's nice to meet you where are you from	3984	B
oh i'm in Garland	3984	B
uh-huh	3984	B
yes i am	3984	B
i wear dresses skirts um	3984	B
that type of attire i'm a secretary	3984	B
uh-huh	3984	B
you don't	3984	B
oh so you can dress carefree right	3984	B
what is your best mode of clothing	3984	B
what is your best mode of clothing you like blue jeans best	3984	B
yes that's what i wear mainly is suits cotton or um gabardine	3984	B
wool sometimes in winter but here in Texas you don't really need wool that often	3984	B
yes	3984	B
no i don't do it every day	3984	B
just occasionally do you have a certain fabric you like better than others	3984	B
uh-huh	3984	B
uh-huh	3984	B
well i like cotton the best it's easier to take care of and it's it's uh a much fresher freer- and freer fabric	3984	B
well cotton you have to iron unfortunately or send to the cleaners but there's some fabrics like you said that uh gabardines and suedes and that that have to go to the cleaners all the time	3984	B
yes	3984	B
yes yes i'm up in corporate	3984	B
yes	3984	B
yes because_1 the first person they see is the secretary before the boss and uh i couldn't uh get away with blue jeans and a T-shirt	3984	B
do you wear sneakers do you wear um	3984	B
brand names or do you just get something off the shelf at the stores	3984	B
um-hum	3984	B
i see do you like sweaters	3984	B
do you wear them often	3984	B
um	3984	B
um-hum	3984	B
oh are you	3984	B
that was my next question is to how you where you used to live and how you dressed in comparison to where you were before	3984	B
uh-huh	3984	B
um-hum	3984	B
are you into hats	3984	B
do you wear hats and for dress up too or just	3984	B
in winter	3984	B
um-hum	3984	B
hum in your new uh career after college you going to need clothes a lot	3984	B
uh-huh	3984	B
um-hum	3984	B
do you like clothes for uh different seasons or do you like just to wear the basically the same type of thing and just add or take away from it	3984	B
i thought it was kind of a strange topic about corruption in the government and um how many people are self-serving	3942	B
i mean that- you i- i think people tend to think that the government is not corrupt and that people aren't self-serving	3942	B
i mean that's what i would like to think	3942	B
um-hum	3942	B
um-hum	3942	B
um-hum yeah	3942	B
right	3942	B
um-hum	3942	B
um-hum	3942	B
um-hum	3942	B
um-hum	3942	B
yeah yeah that makes sense because_1 you pry- start prying in people's private lives you ruin their lives as well as and sometimes you know i don't even know how much of a difference it really makes you know i mean i guess in some cases sure we care about what they did in the past but uh	3942	B
sometimes i don't know it- i think it gets in the way of the better judgement i mean just because he did something in his past doesn't mean he's not a good enough person to be a politician	3942	B
um-hum	3942	B
um-hum	3942	B
that's right um-hum	3942	B
yeah	3942	B
um-hum	3942	B
um-hum	3942	B
yeah	3942	B
um-hum	3942	B
um-hum	3942	B
um-hum	3942	B
oh yeah it's i guess it's what sells newspapers you know	3942	B
um um-hum um-hum um-hum	3942	B
um-hum right	3942	B
hm	3942	B
yeah	3942	B
um-hum	3942	B
yeah i'm kind of the same way i just kind of read the paper follow-up on people- i mean just you know keep an eye on what's going on but i don't really play an active role in any kind of politics	3942	B
um-hum	3942	B
right um-hum	3942	B
right	3942	B
um-hum	3942	B
yeah	3942	B
yeah	3942	B
yeah-	3942	B
well the topic's about government um i'm not altogether sure that that's my best topic um	3942	A
yeah	3942	A
um-hum	3942	A
um-hum	3942	A
uh-huh	3942	A
um-hum	3942	A
yeah i- i- i think that the last uh part of that question was particularly interesting um about um	3942	A
uh uh can all unethical behavior or how much unethical behavior can be made illegal	3942	A
uh because it- it- it seems to me that when uh government or public service of any kind degenerates so much that you have to have so many explicit ethical	3942	A
codes um parallel to the legal codes that uh we're focusing on the wrong thing maybe	3942	A
maybe- maybe that's what is happening maybe so many things have become public with the media over the past you know ten to twenty years that uh	3942	A
it becomes more evident perhaps things that we didn't think of before and just concentrated on the lawmaking or the results that would be seen in public works or bills that are passed or you know etcetera like that and we	3942	A
we're just not exposed to the personal lives of these persons and i couldn't help thinking when that last question- it was a funny question when that last part of the question came about how- how many	3942	A
things can we um actually put a legal code on that um uh how- how much um	3942	A
should it be our uh prerogative to see into the private lives of these people you know um	3942	A
that's right	3942	A
yeah	3942	A
um-hum	3942	A
um-hum	3942	A
i- i- i agree with that and um and also that if the results that they are putting out and what they actually seem to be accomplishing by legitimate means is what's	3942	A
you know going to the public then um	3942	A
then they'll pay for their private life in their own private conscience and uh uh you know- when it becomes public though it becomes scandalous	3942	A
the the that's that's the thing that um it- it- things that	3942	A
you don't know uh do- do do not worm their way around then and influence other people or perhaps lead other people astray people could say oh they do it so i guess you know but as soon as things do get public	3942	A
um there there is that terrible concern so sometimes i ask myself what are um people doing that are in the media	3942	A
when somebody you know comes up to office it seems that one of the first thing that's done is to dig up any kind of a thing they can on them and get it all over the headlines	3942	A
it's a very low way of living um so and- and and and as far as um	3942	A
you know myself having any particular personal uh knowledge or insight into	3942	A
politics or politicians it i'm not	3942	A
terribly involved in it just in a very cursory way i vote and i you know try to do whatever i can on a little local area but i- i it- it just is not one of the things that i have uh placed um	3942	A
and- uh a lot of my particular time and effort into so i- i always feel very	3942	A
outside this kind of um this kind of an issue but um um	3942	A
yeah um-hum um-hum yeah right yeah uh um um-hum i'm not i'm not in there i'm not one of those uh you know volunteers that's there at headquarters and	3942	A
whatever um although i admire the people that do that and they certainly do get inside information and um of course the better you know a person that might be affiliated with that kind of thing	3942	A
the more you can trust their their judgment and their insight but the media insight as you said i just kind of read and	3942	A
kind of be aware and then uh i don't like to make a whole lot of um judgment my- myself unless things are so absolutely out of whack that uh	3942	A
yeah i had five go through college we've put five through college uh-huh	3959	B
uh two at Texas A and M and three at North Texas	3959	B
right so	3959	B
um-hum	3959	B
right right	3959	B
right	3959	B
um-hum that's probably your best bet because you know you narrow it down you're better off i think on that and uh	3959	B
right right	3959	B
is he going on for his master's in his the engineering	3959	B
um-hum	3959	B
you almost need a master's in like if he's in engineering in his major right now one of his majors anyway right now to do anything with it	3959	B
no matter what field you're in	3959	B
uh well my daughter uh both daughters let me see one daughter was in uh business	3959	B
and business degree and then the other daughter was in a special ed degree	3959	B
and lives and works with autistic children um-hum and then the other one was a personnel director	3959	B
uh down in Houston for um several years seven years and then uh my son is a CPA	3959	B
and another has a business degree and then the fifth one is he was hotel management but actually he's in the sign business now and making signs	3959	B
and uh likes that and has kind of hit on a nice setup with that so	3959	B
he is local right here in Richardson and he really loves it um-hum and it's just you know	3959	B
that signs- the type of signs they do is new in the last five years it's the latest thing in signs it's the type that you put on the	3959	B
put on windows and it peels off type- and it looks like it's painted on	3959	B
yes and he	3959	B
yeah	3959	B
right he has the Dallas um Furniture Mart um Clothing Mart and the Trade- World Trade Center all tied up in that he has	3959	B
so yeah so it's a nice deal for him yeah he has he's just starting in it but it seems to be a real up and coming thing	3959	B
because everything's so portable anymore i mean you know things are not stable and people are renting places for a short times and they don't want anything permanent anymore so	3959	B
it works out quite well	3959	B
right	3959	B
right	3959	B
um-hum or on to a larger place and not put that much into anything permanent so it it works out pretty well for him	3959	B
it is it's wonderful it's wonderful	3959	B
so	3959	B
right	3959	B
um-hum	3959	B
yeah the have your son have your son use the library a lot in the college section	3959	B
for scholarships	3959	B
and uh my daughters and sons both did that and they they came up with some of the you know you would never think of applying for and they would apply for them well nobody else did and so they would get some	3959	B
well do you have any children that uh go to college went to college are about to go or anything	3959	A
oh my goodness oh where did they go	3959	A
uh-huh	3959	A
uh i have a son at the present moment who is a senior in high school	3959	A
and uh he has uh made three applications to schools that give a double degree program because that's what he wanted to uh take	3959	A
so he applied to the University of Texas at Austin and to the University of Pennsylvania and to Rice	3959	A
so uh he's waiting at this time uh to uh see what kind of uh acceptances and money grants might uh come in for him	3959	A
so um i- i think that uh it became very evident in the beginning of senior year	3959	A
when he actually had to sit down with the applications he had about six schools that he was interested in	3959	A
but he really decided that he wants to take engineering but he also wants to keep a liberal arts	3959	A
degree and actually get both of them and not all that many places actually give you two degrees	3959	A
so he he weeded out the ones uh that did not offer that kind of thing and just really wound up making three applications so um	3959	A
yeah yeah	3959	A
uh-huh right well yeah and and as i saw the fall progressing and um	3959	A
and his viewpoint it really became more evident that uh	3959	A
he this is what he wanted to do and he didn't just want to get involved in the sciences without having the leeway of the liberal arts and i don't think he'll ever be a um	3959	A
you know a kind of a research dedicated a test tube scientist so um	3959	A
i think he might wanna go to law school	3959	A
and uh use the engineering background maybe in patent law or yeah	3959	A
yeah yeah	3959	A
oh yes that's right yeah what uh kinds of fields did your children study in	3959	A
uh-huh	3959	A
oh wonderful uh-huh	3959	A
is that right	3959	A
uh-huh oh my	3959	A
yeah	3959	A
uh-huh	3959	A
oh my	3959	A
oh gee whiz isn't that wonderful uh-huh	3959	A
is he uh local here in town or is uh-huh	3959	A
oh good for him	3959	A
uh-huh	3959	A
oh	3959	A
oh yes i've seen those they're remarkable because they come right off	3959	A
oh	3959	A
oh good for him	3959	A
oh they've done well uh-huh oh yeah	3959	A
oh yes that is terrific	3959	A
that's right	3959	A
that's right uh-huh	3959	A
that's right you just use it when you need it and uh then it's you know gone and it it sure is very effective and then you can move into the next necessary thing that is uh right	3959	A
that's right	3959	A
it's amazing isn't it amazing everything they do these days	3959	A
uh uh-huh it i- i think it is too it really moves you from one thing to the other without having to hassle and uh you know even like with you said with the signs have to you know to change	3959	A
everything and uh you know	3959	A
um-hum um-hum	3959	A
uh-huh	3959	A
yeah	3959	A
oh really	3959	A
-have you recently bought a car Eric or	3986	A
uh-huh	3986	A
that's a nice car isn't it	3986	A
um-hum	3986	A
can you use it for personal too to-	3986	A
so so you buying a car to you right at this point anyway isn't a a big deal	3986	A
uh-huh	3986	A
yeah	3986	A
we we just bought two years ago we just bought a a Plymouth Voyager	3986	A
and it's been great we've got family- a a family of five three kids and that's the only way to travel as far as i'm concerned the-	3986	A
the kids can get up and move around and you can	3986	A
get them_1 things	3986	A
it- it's not it's a it's a minivan	3986	A
uh and it was the best rating out of the consumer reports and things	3986	A
i do i do and	3986	A
yeah we've only bought two new cars i bought a Nissan Sentra	3986	A
that um and i really liked it too didn't have any problems with it	3986	A
and this one has been been an exceptional vehicle we've really enjoyed it especially for kids	3986	A
uh-huh	3986	A
yes	3986	A
well actually my philosophy about i mean if i was going to buy something for me like	3986	A
a car i'd drive around unfortunately i'd still get a foreign car i think that Honda makes uh like you've got the Accords are very very well built i also really like the Toyota Camrys	3986	A
but they're just not practical if you have kids	3986	A
you can't um	3986	A
well if they get older i guess you can take four or five people but when they're small you got to get up and crawl over the seat and- you know which doesn't work	3986	A
uh-huh	3986	A
yep	3986	A
yeah	3986	A
and uh Chrysler's started doing some nice things with their with their warranties and things i've got a seven year seventy thousand mile warranty on the drive train	3986	A
yeah and a three year thirty six- six thousand mile on uh i think it's a pretty- that's pretty well bumper to bumper	3986	A
but the drive train is seven seventy and that's i think that's one of the well i kind of think that the other manufacturers are now uh bumping it up to meet it but Chrysler was the first to do that	3986	A
yeah	3986	A
yep	3986	A
yeah	3986	A
and i'm thinking about getting a used car with my next one trying to see if i can't take some of the	3986	A
depreciation off i don't know they're still danger expensive you know i'd you know only i only want to buy something like maybe twenty thousand miles on it they they don't go down much you know unless they're a couple years old or something	3986	A
um-hum	3986	A
yeah	3986	A
yeah	3986	A
yes	3986	A
you're kidding me	3986	A
hum	3986	A
yeah	3986	A
huh	3986	A
well- well i didn't buy one i just changed jobs- changed jobs and got a work car or a company car and uh they bought me a Pontiac Grand Prix and	3986	B
i've been yeah i've been pretty happy with it i i've been driving just a little little Honda the Honda Civic and stuff and so it's a bigger car but i've been pretty pleased with it you know i uh	3986	B
it was it's you know got a lot of nice gadgets and stuff but i gosh- it's been nice so far i can't say that it's put it through all the loops	3986	B
yeah i can use it for personal and	3986	B
no not really i although we my other we have a second car and it's getting a little bit old it's an eighty five Honda Civic and so we're thinking in a year or two we might have to but uh	3986	B
you know i- i kind of i just like to keep up i you know don't uh don't plan on buying one like i say for a year or two but sooner or later i'm going to have to	3986	B
but	3986	B
uh-huh	3986	B
uh-huh	3986	B
oh i bet	3986	B
now is that a is that a full size van or	3986	B
minivan	3986	B
oh was it	3986	B
you do so do you shop the consumer reports when you buy a car then or do you	3986	B
do you find that works out pretty good for you	3986	B
uh-huh	3986	B
did you	3986	B
uh-huh	3986	B
well that's good to hear yeah that's good to hear some good news about some American made cars i	3986	B
i uh i really believe they're getting better and you know i- i- i looked around and seen some of those new Saturns and stuff and they seem to be a really nice car	3986	B
and	3986	B
yeah	3986	B
uh-huh	3986	B
uh-huh	3986	B
yeah that's true	3986	B
um-hum	3986	B
oh yeah what we found just even going down to our inlaws overnight uh uh this little Honda Civic there's just not enough room we i've just got one daughter by the time you put the car seat and a couple of bags i mean we're just	3986	B
you know we we uh we were having that problem that why there's just not enough room those small cars any more for- you know we couldn't go camping because we couldn't put a tent and a cooler in it you know it was so small	3986	B
but uh	3986	B
oh really	3986	B
oh really	3986	B
yeah that's-	3986	B
yeah	3986	B
they've had that for a while yeah	3986	B
well it says something they're willing at least put something behind it you know they're they feel like turning out a good product and they're at least	3986	B
yeah that warranty stuff that's uh i did have to take this company car in and the cassette jammed all of a sudden	3986	B
and it was nice to know that you know that warranty- it was still under its warranty and they just took it and took care of it right on the spot but that's definitely something i think i'd shop for i'd want as much warranty as i could because	3986	B
it's expensive to get the things fixed anymore	3986	B
if it's not covered	3986	B
to buy it	3986	B
yeah	3986	B
uh-huh	3986	B
no they don't you know they	3986	B
yeah if you get something that's one or two years old uh you can usually knock i- i worked at a bank as a loan officer and so i could you know i got into that a little bit uh you know the dealership financing and stuff but	3986	B
you know at two years makes a huge difference you know they say and it's pretty much true that you drive off the lot and you lose at least a thousand dollars as soon as you take that thing off the lot in value and the Hondas and some of those they don't depreciate as much but you can still get them_1 a little bit cheaper	3986	B
but i tell you what- it's kind of scary uh we bought our company car through an auction a dealer auction and the dealers they they get those things for about half of what they sell them_1	3986	B
couldn't believe it i uh we stickered the car i got this Grand Prix was stickered at uh sixteen thousand it was a ninety one and had uh had ten thousand miles on it but we ended up getting it for about ten	3986	B
and i mean they bought it for ten they'll sell it for sixteen seventeen thousand i could not believe it had just if you know somebody that's the way to go but unfortunately only the dealers can get in but uh	3986	B
i tell you i i've been real happy with the Hondas actually we had a have a nineteen eighty Honda Accord too	3986	B
okay Janet do you guys have a family budget	3978	A
uh-huh	3978	A
uh-huh	3978	A
it's probably why we're participating too right	3978	A
um-hum	3978	A
um-hum	3978	A
yep is the cost of living uh high down there is it tough to	3978	A
i know it's just a	3978	A
yeah	3978	A
um-hum	3978	A
right	3978	A
um-hum	3978	A
um-hum	3978	A
um the cost of living here is cheap in in fact it's really great we've got a	3978	A
a quite a nice home we've got a five bedroom home- home with a basement in it and it cost me through let me see four years ago it cost me fifty five thousand	3978	A
so it's great i mean uh uh	3978	A
hm	3978	A
right here in Idaho	3978	A
yes i've got a brother in law in Plano Texas and that's how we got hooked up with this uh TI deal but it's	3978	A
um-hum	3978	A
um-hum	3978	A
well that's good	3978	A
um-hum	3978	A
yeah	3978	A
yeah right	3978	A
yeah	3978	A
um-hum	3978	A
yeah well i- i wouldn't uh mine's not nicely located i probably got a bargain i think more	3978	A
um-hum	3978	A
yes i am and my wife is very meticulous about budgeting she has a computer program in fact i'm an accountant i'm a CPA	3978	A
i'm calling you from work tonight uh but uh my wife runs every single check she spends through a computer	3978	A
and she can tell me on a monthly basis and she's more interested not me in fact i only look at it once a year when i do our we do our taxes	3978	A
but she can tell you every month exactly what she's paid for groceries and uh utility bills and for gasoline in the cars and everything she's uh	3978	A
uh-huh	3978	A
um	3978	A
yeah i'm not i'm not uh-huh	3978	A
right	3978	A
um-hum	3978	A
huh	3978	A
hm	3978	A
yep	3978	A
um-hum	3978	A
right	3978	A
yep	3978	A
um-hum	3978	A
right	3978	A
hm	3978	A
we have about twenty five categories is all probably and we write all of our checks out of the register we don't try to do any through the computer and then my wife just sets down when she's got about an hour and just keys them_1 all in	3978	A
and it's really not you know that bad it um	3978	A
well i don't know it might it might've been tough for you but she enjoys it and that's another thing too she really enjoys it	3978	A
she uh	3978	A
uh	3978	A
just gets a thrill out of seeing where her money went i guess	3978	A
um-hum	3978	A
she does she's she teaches at um a small two year college here she's uh teaches uh business communications	3978	A
and	3978	A
we try to like mothers i'm sitting- i'm right this minute dishing up cheap spaghetti which is one way we try and keep within a budget	3978	B
although i'm trying to raise money for a boy scout cause	3978	B
um actually how we do it is my husband and i both work and we try very hard to live on his salary and my salary goes automatically into a savings	3978	B
account which we try not to use too much although from that we both definitely- we typically pay our credit cards from that account	3978	B
so that's the that's the uh our household expenses are pretty well covered because they're pretty much the same every month	3978	B
but it's our credit card spending that it's always the problem	3978	B
i don't know what to compare it to i lived in Indiana and Saint Louis but i was a student then and you know when you're a student things don't mean much um i think Dallas is um	3978	B
relatively high priced homes but then there's not	3978	B
i think energy and some of the other things aren't quite so high	3978	B
and i my my gestalt is that our groceries are sort of intermediate there're not as bad as i have seen in big cities like New York or California areas	3978	B
how about_1 you	3978	B
that is-	3978	B
where are you from originally	3978	B
from- from Idaho	3978	B
well i don't know anyone from Idaho i'm from Indiana um and i have a great love for the Midwest	3978	B
would go back in a minute if i could but i married a Texan	3978	B
they don't always tell you that they have a homing instinct	3978	B
but i our home uh we have a five bedroom home um but it's more in the range of with around two hundred forty thousand	3978	B
so about_1 four and a half times your home i'm sure they're probably quite comparable	3978	B
or maybe i don't know ours is nice our home is nicely located but i don't think the house itself is	3978	B
particularly extraordinary	3978	B
how about_1 budget wise how how do you do a family budget are you married	3978	B
uh my husband tries very hard to do that for us and we used the Managing Your Money software package with Andrew Tobias he is familiar with that one	3978	B
well i mean now i'm sure there are a million software packages but um he tried very hard and we were all computerized and we	3978	B
our regular monthly checks we printed you know um and i hated- i did it for three years and hated every minute of it and still founded about half of our checks	3978	B
maybe a third i still hand wrote because it would be like in the school parking lot or	3978	B
you know at my child's skating lesson or something like that so we had to come we had two checks two sizes of checks	3978	B
um	3978	B
excuse me <b_aside> Beth right there <e_aside>	3978	B
my daughter wants to know where the spaghetti cheese is um so we we tried and it was pretty nice one of one mistake i think we made in that is that um	3978	B
for budgeting purposes in terms of putting it in a budget we must have had eighty different categories and so they they became sort of nonsensical instead of i always said if we had redone it we should have just put big categories like utilities	3978	B
and you know luxuries and entertainment that sort of thing	3978	B
well i see i suppose that's the key um	3978	B
do you does your wife work outside the home	3978	B
oh my goodness well with a CPA and a business person you should be organized	3978	B
yeah	3978	B
